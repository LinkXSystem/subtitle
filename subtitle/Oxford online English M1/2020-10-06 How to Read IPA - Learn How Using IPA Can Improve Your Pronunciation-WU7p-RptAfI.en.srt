00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:08,960
Hi, I’m Gina. Welcome to Oxford Online English!\h
In this lesson, you can learn about using IPA.\h\h

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,160
You’ll see how using IPA can\h
improve your English pronunciation\h\h

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,800
and help you to avoid pronunciation mistakes.

help you with your English speaking, writing,\h
IELTS preparation, or whatever else you need.

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,680
So, this lesson is about\h
IPA. What does IPA stand for?\h

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,240
IPA stands for ‘international phonetic alphabet’.\h
Maybe you know something about IPA already.\h\h

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,920
For example…
Why do you need IPA? Well,\h\h

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,280
you don’t *have* to learn it, but it can\h
help you with English learning. Here’s why.

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,880
English spelling and pronunciation are horribly\h
irregular. Take these words as examples:\h\h

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,760
thorough, Wednesday, consciousness, or champagne.\h

13
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,640
There’s not much relation between what you write\h
and what you say. That makes things difficult.\h\h

14
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,280
To make it clear why this is,\h
let’s do a different test.\h\h

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,720
We’re going to show you some colours. Say the\h
colour of the square out loud as you see it.\h

16
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,880
Did you say ‘red’, ‘blue’, ‘yellow’?\h\h

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,880
Did the words in a different colour slow you down?\h

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,120
Maybe that was easy, maybe not. Either\h
way, your brain has to work harder,\h\h

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,280
because in this test, you have to read a word,\h
and then ignore it and say something different.

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,400
That’s what reading English is like. You have\h
to see one thing, and say something else.\h\h

21
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,360
Often, your instinct is to read the letters you\h
see phonetically. This is tiring to fight against,\h\h

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,680
and it leads to pronunciation mistakes,\h
which can easily become bad habits over time.

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,760
Using IPA when you study vocabulary\h
solves this problem for you. With IPA,\h\h

24
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,560
you don’t have to see one thing and say\h
another. IPA is one hundred per cent phonetic.\h\h

25
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,640
That means the pronunciation and the\h
‘spelling’ match exactly, every time.

26
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,720
If you’ve never used IPA before,\h
it might look complicated.

27
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,560
It’s not. You can learn to use IPA from\h
zero with one or two hours of practice.

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,200
In the rest of this lesson, you’ll get a basic\h
introduction to reading and writing in IPA,\h\h

29
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,840
and you’ll see how you can use it to make your\h
English learning easier and more effective.

30
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,520
One note before we continue: we’re using IPA\h
based on southern British English pronunciation.\h\h

31
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,480
Other varieties of English, like US English,\h
are written slightly differently in IPA.\h\h

32
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,000
However, the differences are not large.

33
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,800
So now, let’s look at how to read IPA.\h

34
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,360
First, some good news! Many IPA symbols are easy,\h\h

35
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,520
because they look like regular letters,\h
and have the same pronunciation.

36
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:02,480
This is true for many consonant\h
sounds, like /b/, /m/ or /l/.

37
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,640
Let’s try it. Even if you’ve\h
never used IPA before,\h\h

38
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,680
I think you could guess what these words are.\h

39
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:19,040
Can you say the words? They\h
are: street, traffic, darkness.\h

40
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:31,040
Remember that in IPA, the same sound is always\h
written the same way. In English, a /k/ sound\h\h

41
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:39,600
can be written with the letters ‘k’ ‘c’, or maybe\h
‘q’, but in IPA, you always write it with ‘k’.

42
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,840
Consonant sounds which are often\h
written with two letters in English,\h\h

43
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:56,000
like /ð/, /ʃ/ or /dʒ/, have symbols in IPA\h
which look different from regular letters.\h\h

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,760
However, there aren’t so\h
many of them. Take a look.\h

45
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,200
Pause the video if you want\h
more time to study these.\h

46
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,280
Ready? Let’s do some practice.\h
Can you read these words in IPA?

47
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:23,840
Can you read the words? They are:\h
fridge, think, teacher, shopping.

48
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,440
By the way, do you see the little mark\h
which looks like an apostrophe in the\h\h

49
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:38,240
last two words? Do you know what it means?
This mark shows you where the stress is\h\h

50
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,040
in the word. The syllable after\h
this little mark is stressed.

51
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,840
Now, you can already read a lot\h
in IPA. What do you need next?\h

52
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:00,480
Reading vowels in IPA is a little more\h
work. Why? Because the Roman alphabet\h\h

53
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:07,920
has six vowel letters, but there are at least\h
22 phonetic vowels in English pronunciation.

54
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,000
Why ‘at least?’ It’s because there isn’t\h
one way to pronounce English, and so\h\h

55
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,840
there’s more than one way to write English in IPA.

56
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,160
Also, sometimes people use different\h
systems for writing in IPA. For example,\h\h

57
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,360
one book might use the same symbol for two vowel\h
sounds which are very similar to each other,\h\h

58
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,360
but another book might use different symbols.

59
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:46,160
Don’t worry about this. It’s not a problem.\h
In this video, you’re seeing a common system\h\h

60
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,760
for writing English in IPA. You might see\h
different patterns or symbols in other places.\h\h

61
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,600
It doesn’t mean that one way is right or wrong.

62
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,240
Anyway, let’s see how to read vowels in IPA.

63
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,280
You might know already that there are\h
three kinds of vowel sounds in English:\h\h

64
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,880
short sounds, long sounds and diphthongs.

65
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:23,600
For example, the /ɪ/ sound in ‘bit’ is\h
short. The /ɔː/ sound in ‘door’ is long.\h\h

66
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,640
The /əʊ/ sound in ‘home’ is a diphthong.

67
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,040
It’s easy to see the difference between\h
these three types of sounds in IPA.\h\h

68
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,120
Short sounds appear as a single symbol.

69
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,920
Remember to pause whenever you need if you\h
want to look at something in more detail.\h\h

70
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,320
Long sounds have a mark after\h
them, which looks like a colon.\h

71
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,160
Diphthongs appear as two symbols.
Going through the pronunciations of\h\h

72
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,760
all the vowel sounds would take a long time,\h
plus we already made a whole video about it!\h\h

73
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,880
If you’re watching on YouTube, you can\h
find a link in the video description.

74
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,960
You can also check the full version\h
of this lesson on our website.\h\h

75
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,840
There are notes on IPA symbols\h
and how to pronounce them.

76
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,040
Reading vowel sounds in IPA is more\h
difficult, because there are more\h\h

77
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:37,200
possible spellings for each sound, so the\h
connection between the IPA and the spelling\h\h

78
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,880
might be less obvious. But, with a little\h
practice, you’ll be able to do it easily.

79
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,120
Let’s try a few words now.\h

80
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,640
Pause the video if you want\h
more time to think about it.

81
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:03,840
Ready? The words are: woman,\h
banana, brown, floor, information.

82
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Let’s try five more. These\h
are a little more challenging.\h

83
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,120
Can you work out what these words are?\h
Again, pause the video if you need to.

84
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:27,360
The words are: airport,\h
mango, anyone, early, zero.

85
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,520
Did you get them right?\h\h

86
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,800
If so, great! If not, don’t worry. You just\h
need more time to get familiar with IPA.

87
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,240
How can you practise? Easy!\h
There’s a great website:\h\h

88
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,720
tophonetics dot com. You can\h
paste text into the site,\h\h

89
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,000
and it will change the text to IPA. You can\h
even choose between UK and US pronunciation.

90
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:03,200
Take a text, paste it in to the website, and\h
try reading the IPA. Spend a little time on\h\h

91
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:10,720
this kind of practice – five or ten minutes a\h
day – and you’ll soon find it easy to read IPA.

92
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,160
What if you want to write in\h
IPA on a computer or phone?\h\h

93
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:25,840
There are several options, but a good\h
free one is ipa dot typeit dot org.

94
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:32,800
Now, you should have all the resources you\h
need to practise reading and writing using IPA.\h\h

95
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,360
But, how should you use them? Let’s look.

96
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,160
In this section, we’ll give\h
you some advice on using IPA\h\h

97
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,000
to help you learn English more\h
efficiently and speak better.

98
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:57,760
Our first piece of advice might sound\h
strange: consider *not* using IPA! Why?\h\h

99
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,480
Some people don’t benefit from it.

100
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:08,080
In our experience, using IPA is *really*\h
helpful for some learners, but not for everyone.

101
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,920
For example, some learners get better results\h
by listening and copying the pronunciation.\h\h

102
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,840
Some people are good at this, but\h
there are others who can’t do it well.

103
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:30,800
This isn’t a problem. Different people learn\h
in different ways. If you find IPA confusing\h\h

104
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:37,360
and you don’t feel that it’s helping you, don’t\h
feel that you have to use it. It’s just a tool.\h\h

105
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,560
You can use it if it’s helpful, but\h
there are other ways to learn, too.

106
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,920
If you think IPA will be\h
helpful for you, then what?

107
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,720
First, whatever dictionary you use, find\h
where the IPA transcriptions are given.\h\h

108
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,160
Some dictionaries hide the phonetic transcription\h
behind a button, or at the bottom of the page.

109
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,192
Our two recommended online dictionaries are\h
Lexico and Longman. Lexico puts the phonetic\h\h

110
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:07,440
transcription at the bottom. Longman has it\h
next to the word, at the top of the page.

111
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,560
Second, get in the habit of writing down the\h
IPA next to the word when you write down new\h\h

112
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:24,320
vocabulary. Don’t forget to mark the stress!\h
Word stress is essential for clear pronunciation.

113
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,120
When you’re reviewing vocabulary, you should read\h
the words out loud to practise the pronunciation.\h\h

114
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,600
When you do this, look *only* at the IPA. Don’t\h
think about the spelling of the written word.\h\h

115
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,480
Look at the IPA and say the word out loud.

116
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,480
This way, you can be sure that\h
you’re pronouncing words correctly\h\h

117
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:59,120
from the first time you study them. That lets you\h
avoid training bad habits and making mistakes.

118
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,240
Learning IPA for the first time can take a\h
couple of hours, but it’s worth the time.\h\h

119
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Get into these habits, and your\h
pronunciation will be clearer\h\h

120
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,320
and more accurate, and it doesn’t\h
need much effort from you.

121
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,800
Do you have any other tips for using IPA\h
to improve your English pronunciation?\h\h

Please let us know in the comments!

123
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,920
Thanks for watching!

124
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,840
See you next time!
