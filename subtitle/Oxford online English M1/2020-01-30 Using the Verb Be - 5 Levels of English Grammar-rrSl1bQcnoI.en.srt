00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,710
Hi, I’m Oli.

skills!

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,430
Are you a beginner?

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,220

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,940
Here’s how this lesson works.

17
00:00:57,949 --> 00:00:59,989
There are five levels.

18
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,400
Each level is more difficult than the previous
one.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,220
Level one is beginner.

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,740
Levels two to four are intermediate.

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,500
Level five is high intermediate to advanced.

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,430
If you’re not a beginner, start at level
two!

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,370
At each level, you can see what you need to
focus on if you have difficulties.

24
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,040
Ready?

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,380
Let’s start!

26
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,700
Here are five sentences.

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,600
Complete the sentences with one word.

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,680
Pause the video and think about your answers.

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,980
If you want extra practice, say your answers
aloud!

30
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,260
Ready?

31
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,840
Here are the answers.

32
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,720
Did you get all five right?

33
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,990
You should probably fast forward to level
2!

34
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,090
Did you make a mistake?

35
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,990
Here’s what you need.

36
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:59,280
One: you need to know the positive forms of
‘be’, including the past forms: ‘was’

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,500
and ‘were’.

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Here they are.

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,450
Pause the video to look if you need more time.

40
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,080
You also need to know the negative forms of
‘be’.

41
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,180
Here they are.

42
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,960
Again, pause if you need time to look.

43
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:22,040
You can see that most negatives have a contraction,
or sometimes two.

44
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,129
You should use the contraction most of the
time when you’re speaking.

45
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,900
It doesn’t matter which contracted form
you use.

46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,020
Ready?

47
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,290
Let’s go to level two!

48
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,459
Here are your five sentences.

49
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,140
Complete each sentence with one word.

50
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,260
Contractions – like ‘isn’t’ – count
as one word.

51
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,560
Again, pause the video to think about your
answers if you need time.

52
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,330
Ready?

53
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,320
Here are the answers.

54
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,100
What’s the point here?

55
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,340
You can use ‘be’ to make continuous forms.

56
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:10,420
Continuous forms have many uses; for example,
you use continuous forms to talk about something

57
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,219
happening at one moment in time.

58
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:22,040
For all continuous forms, you need to remember
one rule: ‘be’ plus -ing verb.

59
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:29,820
*All* continuous forms need both things: ‘be’
and a verb with -ing.

60
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,120
There are other continuous forms – you’ll
see some of them later!

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,900
Let’s see all the forms for the present
continuous, past continuous, and future continuous.

62
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,880
You’ll see forms with the verb ‘go’
as an example.

63
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:52,040
Each list will appear for three seconds; pause
the video if you need more time to look.

64
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,060
Also, don’t forget that you can see all
this information on the free lesson page on

65
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,060
our website.

66
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:05,090
If you’re watching on YouTube, you can find
a link in the video description.

67
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,450
What about sentence number five?

68
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,099
Did you get it right?

69
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:12,200
Do you find it strange?

70
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,450
You can use ‘be’ in the continuous, normally
to talk about people.

71
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,200
You use it when someone is behaving in a way
which isn’t normal for them.

72
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,820
For example, if you say ‘She’s being so
impatient at the moment’, you mean that

73
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:33,410
she’s generally a patient person, but she’s
behaving impatiently now.

74
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,350
Maybe she’s under a lot of stress, and it’s
having an influence on her.

75
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,000
When you use ‘be’ in the continuous, you
have the verb ‘be’ twice, like ‘she’s

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,860
being’.

77
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,540
This might look strange, but ‘be’ follows
the same rules as every other verb.

78
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,010
You make a continuous form by using the verb
‘be’ plus an -ing verb.

79
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,080
That’s the end of level two.

80
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:06,720
Remember that you can always review a section
if you need to.

81
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,040
Here are five more sentences.

82
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,920
This time, you need to complete each sentence
with two words.

83
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,020
One word should be a form of ‘be’.

84
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:22,940
Remember that contractions – like ‘isn’t’
– count as one word.

85
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,460
Ready?

86
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,460
Here are the answers.

87
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,160
So, what’s the idea here?

88
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,070
You can use ‘be’ in different times and
tenses, like any other verb.

89
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:43,640
‘Be’ has perfect forms, like ‘have been’,
‘has been’ and ‘had been’.

90
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,500
‘Be’ doesn’t behave differently to other
verbs here.

91
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,680
Sometimes we hear questions like “How do
you use ‘have been’ and ‘has been’?”

92
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,680
What’s the difference between ‘have been’
and ‘had been’?

93
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,190
These aren’t questions about using ‘be’.

94
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,640
If you’re asking these questions, you need
to learn more about perfect tenses.

95
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:10,940
‘Be’ can also be used in the future, with
verbs like ‘will’ or ‘going to’.

96
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:16,300
Like you saw in level two, you can have the
verb ‘be’ twice in one sentence if you

97
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,800
use a verb like ‘be going to’, which contains
‘be’.

98
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,460
In number three, the first ‘be’ – ‘isn’t’
– is part of the verb ‘be going to’,

99
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,170
which you use to talk about the future.

100
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,000
The second ‘be’ is the main verb.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,130
It goes with the word ‘late’.

102
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,790
If you’ve got everything right so far, you
know a lot about English verb forms and how

103
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,620
to use ‘be’.

104
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,760
Ready for level four?

105
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,630
This time, let’s do something different.

106
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,690
Here are five sentences, like before.

107
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,910
This time, there is a mistake in each sentence.

108
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,260
Can you correct the mistakes?

109
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,260
Pause the video, and think about the corrections.

110
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,000
Write your answers down, if you want.

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,240
Ready?

112
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,420
Here are the answers.

113
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,020
Can you see what connects these five sentences?

114
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,960
They all involve the passive voice.

115
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,270
To make the passive voice, you need two things:
‘be’ plus a past participle.

116
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,870
Often, English learners make mistakes like
these.

117
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,670
Sometimes, they forget to use ‘be’ in
a passive sentence, like in sentence number

118
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,670
one.

119
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:41,330
Sometimes, they add ‘be’ where it isn’t
needed, like in sentences two and five.

120
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,300
Be careful, because remember that ‘be’
is also used to make continuous forms.

121
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,560
And, there are passive continuous forms.

122
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,020
Do you mix these up?

123
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,000
It’s not always easy, but there are simple
rules which work.

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,520
Continuous forms use ‘be’ plus an -ing
verb.

125
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,580
This rule has no exceptions.

126
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,380
Passive forms use ‘be’ plus a past participle.

127
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,940
This rule also has no exceptions!

128
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:16,760
So, in sentence four, you have a continuous
form: ‘was being’, and a passive form:

129
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,140
‘being cleaned’.

130
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:21,100
They overlap,
but they follow the rules.

131
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,610
‘Be’ plus -ing verb, and then ‘be’
plus past participle.

132
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:31,360
If you have difficulties here, then study
continuous forms and the passive voice.

133
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,180
Pay attention to passive continuous forms,
so that you can avoid mistakes with ‘be’

134
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,500
like you saw in our examples.

135
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,800
OK, let’s move on to our last level!

136
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,519
Here are your sentences.

137
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,660
You need to complete the missing words.

138
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,839
This time, you can use one or two words.

139
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:59,060
At least one word in each gap must be a form
of ‘be’.

140
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,500
How did you do?

141
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,580
Here are the full sentences.

142
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,760
So, what’s this about?

143
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,830
Like every verb, ‘be’ has infinitive and
gerund forms.

144
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,579
You can see this in sentence number one.

145
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:22,400
The sentence is passive, so you need – remember?
– ‘be’ plus a past participle.

146
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,420
But, you’re using the verb ‘like’, which
needs a gerund.

147
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:32,910
So, ‘talk’ is passive, but *also* a gerund:
‘being talked’.

148
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,529
Usually, we talk about infinitives and gerunds
like they’re single things.

149
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:40,120
But, there are different infinitives.

150
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,820
There’s an infinitive with ‘to’, and
an infinitive without ‘to’.

151
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,680
There are also continuous infinitives – ‘be
being’ – and perfect infinitives – ‘have

152
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,320
been’.

153
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:59,180
The gerund – being – also has a perfect
form – having been.

154
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,320
You often need the different infinitives with
modal verbs.

155
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,240
Modal verbs don’t have past forms, so if
you want to express a past meaning, you need

156
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,089
to use a perfect infinitive after the verb.

157
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:13,680
For example, look at sentence number two.

158
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,340
Think about the difference between these two
sentences.

159
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,260
‘Would’ is a modal verb, so it doesn’t
have a past form.

160
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,899
‘I would like to be there’ could mean
now, or in the future.

161
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:33,059
To talk about the past, you need a perfect
infinitive: ‘I would like to have been there.’

162
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:36,860
You can see a continuous infinitive in sentence
three.

163
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,960
The room is in the process of being redecorated
now, so you use a continuous form.

164
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,700
It’s also passive, so you need the verb
‘be’ twice – once for the continuous

165
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,080
form, and once for the passive form.

166
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,640
Sentence four uses a perfect gerund, and is
also passive.

167
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,720
Perfect forms need a past participle, and
passive forms also need a past participle.

168
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,460
This means you have two past participles in
a row: ‘been involved’.

169
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,000
Confused?

170
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:12,529
It might take time to get comfortable with.

171
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:17,240
However, if you could understand the previous
parts of this lesson, then you have the tools

172
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,930
you need to understand and form sentences
like this.

173
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:27,050
These sentences don’t require new rules
or ideas; they require you to combine rules,

174
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,150
because they combine multiple verbs.

175
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:34,410
However, each step follows a simple, predictable
rule.

176
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,439
What about sentence five?

177
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,620
This looks like a gerund, although technically
it’s a participle.

178
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:46,500
Participle clauses like this are a way to
add extra information to a noun.

179
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:51,680
In this case, the subject of the sentence
is ‘he’, and the participle clause gives

180
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,430
us extra information about him.

181
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:00,949
You use a perfect participle because you’re
talking about the past as well as the present.

182
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:05,470
