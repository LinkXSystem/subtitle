00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,129
Hi, I’m Lori.

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:05,380
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:11,120
In this lesson, you can learn how to talk
about smartphones in English.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,040
You’ll see the process of buying a new smartphone.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,320
You’ll also learn how to describe the features
of a smartphone, say what’s most important

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,800
to you, and ask questions about what a smartphone
can do.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:31,820

use!

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,380
But now, let’s see some useful language
for buying a new smartphone.

13
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,230
Hello, can I help you with anything?

14
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,840
Hi, yes, I’m looking for a new phone.

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,630
I have some ideas, but maybe you can make
some recommendations?

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,630
Of course!

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,590
What are you looking for in your new phone?

18
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,430
Well, for me, the number one priority is good
battery life.

19
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,160
I travel a lot for work, and I need a phone
which can last at least a full day without

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,900
problems.

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,320
I see.

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,580
Is anything else important?

23
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,520
I take a lot of pictures, so I want something
with a decent camera.

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,800
It doesn’t have to be amazing, but I’d
like a phone which can take good-quality pictures.

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,840
It’d be a bonus if it could take good photos
in low light, because a lot of phone cameras

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,980
don’t do well in darker conditions, I’ve
found.

27
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:46,500
That’s true, but camera technology is getting
better all the time.

28
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,740
Even mid-range modern phones can take excellent
photos in a wide range of conditions.

29
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,560
If I may ask, what’s your budget?

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,920
I guess I’m aiming for something in the
mid-range.

31
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:04,090
I don’t need something top-of-the-line,
so maybe around two, three hundred Euros.

32
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,090
That’s fine; I have a few ideas for you.

33
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,500
Follow me, please.

34
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,400
If you were shopping for a new phone, what
would you look for?

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,750
What’s your top priority?

36
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:26,209
Do you always buy the same brand, or do you
look for something different, like good battery

37
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:29,980
life, or the lowest possible price?

38
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:37,120
In the dialogue, you heard: ‘The number
one priority is good battery life.’

39
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:43,290
Of course, you can use this phrase with different
features, as in: ‘The number one priority

40
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,529
is a good front camera for selfies.’

41
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:52,829
You could say the same thing in a different
way like this: ‘The most important thing

42
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:57,200
for me is good battery life.’

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:05,569
You also heard: ‘I take a lot of pictures,
so I want something with a decent camera.’

44
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:09,279
‘Decent’ means ‘quite good’.

45
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:15,120
If something is decent, it’s above average,
but not the best.

46
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,680
If you say this, you mean that you don’t
need the best, most expensive camera there

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,989
is, but you want something that’s good enough.

48
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:34,620
If something is less important, you can use
the phrase ‘It’d be a bonus if…’

49
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,260
In the dialogue, you heard ‘It’d be a
bonus if it could take good photos in low

50
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,319
light.’

51
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,819
A ‘bonus’ is something which is nice to
have, but not absolutely necessary.

52
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:55,439
So, you might say: ‘It’d be a bonus if
it had a brighter screen.’

53
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,989
Finally, to set your budget, you could say
something like this: ‘I’m aiming for something

54
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:05,100
in the mid-range.’

55
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,740
‘I want to spend as little as possible.’

56
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:15,889
‘I’d like something cheap, but without
compromising on what I need.’

57
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:22,030
If you put these phrases together, you should
be able to say two to three sentences about

58
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:28,600
what you need in a smartphone, what you’d
like to have, and how much you’re willing

59
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,159
to spend.

60
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:38,180
For example: ‘The most important thing for
me is that it’s fast and has good performance.

61
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,640
It’d be a bonus if it had over 100 gigabytes
of storage.

62
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:54,710
I’m aiming for the upper mid-range, so I’d
like to spend maybe four, five hundred maximum.’

63
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,849
Could you make an answer like this?

64
00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:00,650
Pause the video and make an answer.

65
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,620
If you need, you can review this section to
get the language you need.

66
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,760
Say your answer out loud.

67
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,060
Ready?

68
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,800
Let’s look at our next section.

69
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,169
I think this would be a good choice, based
on what you told me.

70
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:30,169
It has a 48 megapixel dual camera, and great
camera software which makes it easy to take

71
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:34,180
good pictures in low light conditions, like
you said.

72
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:41,460
The battery should last two to three days
with normal usage, and currently it’s discounted

73
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,980
to 250 Euros.

74
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,560
That sounds good!

75
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,120
How much memory does it have?

76
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,479
Do you mean RAM, or internal storage?

77
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,919
Storage, I guess.

78
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,870
You know, for music, photos and so on.

79
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:02,880
It has 64 gigabytes of internal storage, and
you can also add a micro SD card if you need

80
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
more.

81
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,380
Mmm…

82
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,219
Oh yeah, one more thing: does it have a headphone
jack?

83
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:12,129
I listen to music on my headphones, and I
saw a lot of new phones don’t have the connector

84
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:13,470
for wired headphones.

85
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:20,150
Yes, it has a 3.5 millimetre jack for headphones,
or an aux cable, or whatever.

86
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,850
Ah, good!

87
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:26,560
Last thing, I probably should have mentioned
this earlier: can it take two SIM cards?

88
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:34,250
Yes, it’s dual-SIM, although the second
SIM card goes in the micro SD slot, so you

89
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,819
have to choose between two SIM cards or extra
storage; you can’t have both.

90
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,840
That’s a little annoying…

91
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,860
Are there any phones which don’t have that?

92
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,680
Yes…

93
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,199
I have one idea.

94
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,639
Let me show you.

95
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,879
In the dialogue, I asked three questions about
the phone’s features.

96
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,460
Can you remember what you heard?

97
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,770
You heard: ‘How much storage does it have?’

98
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,100
Does it have a headphone jack?’

99
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,580
‘Can it take two SIM cards?’

100
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,199
Think about these basic question forms.

101
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,689
Can you think of three more questions you
could ask about a smartphone, using these

102
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,009
question forms?

103
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,310
Pause the video and think about your answers.

104
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,960
If you want extra practice, write them down!

105
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,710
Of course, there are many possibilities.

106
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:42,760
Here are three suggestions: ‘How much RAM
does it have?’

107
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,240
‘Does it have a fingerprint scanner?’

108
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,110
‘Can it last all day on a single charge?’

109
00:07:54,110 --> 00:08:01,870
What about you; were your questions similar,
or did you get something completely different?

110
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:07,249
There are many other questions you could ask,
but next, let’s see how to describe other

111
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:12,680
features of a smartphone in more detail.

112
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,480
So, this one is a little more expensive, but I

113
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,900
think you do get a lot more for your money.

114
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:28,199
It has dual-SIM capability, 128 gigs of storage,
which can be expanded with a memory card if

115
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,310
you need, and a much better screen.

116
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:39,320
The screen is very hi-res, so everything looks
sharp, and it also has extremely accurate

117
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,700
colours, which might be of interest if you’re
into photography.

118
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,060
Colour accuracy?

119
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,780
What does that mean?

120
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,550
Just that the colours you see on the screen
are exactly how they look in real life.

121
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:57,510
Some screens, especially on cheaper phones,
don’t have accurate colour reproduction,

122
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,960
so everything looks too blue, or too orange,
or whatever.

123
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,540
OK, I don’t think that’s so important…

124
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:14,340
It also has an 8-core CPU and 8 gigabytes
of RAM, so everything runs fast, and you can

125
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,440
multi-task, have several apps open at once…

126
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,101
What’s this thing on the back?

127
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,060
It’s the fingerprint scanner.

128
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:28,400
This phone also has face recognition, so you
can unlock it just by looking into the camera.

129
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Hmm…

130
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,500
And, how much is it?

131
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,990
It’s 750 Euros, but I could take 50 Euro
off the price, so 700.

132
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,360
That’s too much!

133
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,330
I think I’ll take the first phone you showed
me.

134
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,730
Of course.

135
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,730
Here are some things you heard in the dialogue.

136
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,420
Could you explain what they mean in English?

137
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,420
‘It has dual-SIM capability.’

138
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,080
‘The screen is very hi-res.’

139
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:09,260
‘It has an 8-core CPU, so you can multi-task.’

140
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,380
Imagine you’re an English teacher, and you
want to explain these words to someone who

141
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,190
doesn’t know them.

142
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,540
How would you do it?

143
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:25,640
‘Dual-SIM’ means that the phone can use
two SIM cards at the same time, so you can

144
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,800
have two phone numbers on one device.

145
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,500
‘Hi-res’ is short for ‘high resolution’.

146
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:42,220
This means that the screen has more pixels,
so text and images will look clearer.

147
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,820
An 8-core CPU is a processor which can run
many different calculations at the same time.

148
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,680
So, you can multi-task: you can have several
apps open, and you can use your phone to do

149
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,230
several things at once without it slowing
down.

150
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:07,940
Do you remember any other smartphone features
which were mentioned in the dialogue?

151
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:14,320
You heard: ‘The screen has extremely accurate
colours.’

152
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,580
‘It also has face recognition.’

153
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,540
‘It has 8 gigabytes of RAM.’

154
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,670
What about your phone?

155
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,900
At this point in the lesson, you should have
enough language to describe the features of

156
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,000
your phone in detail.

157
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,840
Your job is to make a longer answer talking
about your phone.

158
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,360
Remember that you can review earlier sections
if you need to!

159
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,300
Aim to make at least five sentences.

160
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,640
Pause the video and do it now.

161
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,020
OK, how was that?

162
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,180
Could you make a clear, fluent answer?

163
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,980
Let’s look at one more point.

164
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,950
So, will you be needing any accessories?

165
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,580
Like what?

166
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,970
Well, for sure you should get a screen protector.

167
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,060
It’ll stop the glass from getting scratched
or damaged.

168
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,610
How much is it?

169
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,380
10 Euros, and we can put it on for you right
now.

170
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,750
Can’t I do it myself?

171
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,010
You can, but it’s fiddly.

172
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,920
OK, I’ll take one of those.

173
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,140
Is it worth getting a case to protect it?

174
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:34,040
Perhaps, although phones are a lot tougher
than they used to be.

175
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:40,750
Of course, I don’t recommend it, but you
can drop it and it’ll be fine nine times

176
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,750
out of ten.

177
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,880
I think I’ll take a case, too.

178
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,900
I broke my last phone by dropping it, and
I’d be so angry if it happened again.

179
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,120
Sure.

180
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,620
Take a look over here; any of these cases
will fit, and they’ll keep your phone safe.

181
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,630
Hmm…

182
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,830
This one’s nice.

183
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,680
It’s fifteen?

184
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,100
That’s right.

185
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,900
Also, one more thing: if you’re worried
about breaking your phone, you could buy an

186
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,690
extended warranty.

187
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:13,870
It covers you for three years, and it includes
insurance against accidental damage, so if

188
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:20,080
you drop your phone, or it falls in water,
or anything like that, you can bring it back

189
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,080
and we’ll repair it at no extra cost.

190
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,960
How much is it?

191
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,520
It costs 65 Euros,

192
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,250
Oh, no, no thanks.

193
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,250
No problem.

194
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,250
Is that everything?

195
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,060
Yes, thanks so much.

196
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,000
Where do I pay?

197
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,870
Come with me and I’ll show you.

198
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:42,440
When you buy a new phone, you might also buy
some accessories.

199
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:48,980
‘Accessories’ mean small, extra things
which go with something larger you bought.

200
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:57,320
Accessories can be cosmetic, like a case,
or functional, like a screen protector.

201
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:02,980
Can you think of other examples of smartphone
accessories?

202
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:09,780
You could also buy a spare charger, a Bluetooth
headset, or a mount so that you can see your

203
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,370
phone while you’re driving.

204
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:19,060
During the dialogue, the salesperson also
offered me an extended warranty.

205
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,680
Do you know what this means?

206
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,540
A ‘warranty’ and a ‘guarantee’ have
the same meaning here.

207
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:34,840
The manufacturer, or the retailer, are responsible
if anything goes wrong with the product.

208
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,100
Normally, a warranty lasts one year.

209
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:48,060
Some retailers and manufacturers offer extended
warranties, which are a kind of insurance.

210
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:54,320
At this point, you should be able to buy a
new smartphone in English, describe exactly

211
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,540
what you need, and buy any accessories which
you want.

212
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,380
Here’s a question: what kind of phone do
you have?

213
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,640
Would you recommend it to others?

214
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,190
Why or why not?

215
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:13,600
Please share your ideas in the comments, and
practise your English!

216
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,010
Try to use the language which you’ve learned
in this lesson.

217
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,250
Thanks for watching!

218
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,899
See you next time!
