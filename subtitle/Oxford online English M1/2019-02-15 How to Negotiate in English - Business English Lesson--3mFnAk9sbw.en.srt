00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,820
Hi, I’m Gina.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,720
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,880
In this lesson, you can learn useful language
for business negotiations.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,900
You’ll learn how to make your position clear,
how to accept or reject the other side’s

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:23,690
proposals, and how to express yourself in
clear, professional-sounding English.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:31,460
If you haven’t already seen them, I suggest
you watch our videos on chairing and attending

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,800
meetings.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Negotiations are also a kind of business meeting,
and the language from those videos will also

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,300
help you in these situations.

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:49,510
Don’t forget that you should also visit
our website: Oxford Online English dot com.

11
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,769
You can find many free English lessons, and
also book lessons with one of our professional

12
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:59,690
teachers if you need more help.

13
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,170
In this lesson, you’ll see a scenario where
I’ll role-play a purchaser for a clothing

14
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,430
wholesaler.

15
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,280
Daniel will role-play the manufacturer’s
representative, and we’ll be negotiating

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,640
a deal.

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,780
Let’s look at the first part.

18
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,680
So, let’s get started.

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,880
I’ve read your proposals, and I understand
you’re looking for unbranded clothing in

20
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,580
a variety of styles.

21
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,920
That’s right.

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,820
Meaning: t-shirts, tank tops, hoodies, zip-up
tops, and long-sleeved tees, right?

23
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,820
Correct.

24
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,820
Alright.

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,100
So, my first question is: what kind of volumes
are we looking at?

26
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:49,710
Well, we’re a reseller, so we rebrand the
clothing and sell it on to retailers.

27
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:56,030
We can potentially move quite a lot of product,
but I suggest starting small and scaling up

28
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,030
later.

29
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:04,520
We’re thinking of starting with around 500
to 1500 units per SKU, with more in popular

30
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,420
sizes and colours.

31
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,869
And that would be per-month, or…?

32
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,069
We’d prefer to keep things flexible to begin
with.

33
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:14,549
What do you have in mind exactly?

34
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:21,150
I’m not against flexibility, but logistics
require a certain amount of forward planning.

35
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,609
Of course!

36
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:28,110
Let me ask you something: what’s the situation
regarding production and delivery?

37
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,319
How long does it take you to process orders?

38
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:36,760
It’s not completely fixed, but around two
weeks.

39
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,889
Larger orders can take more time.

40
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:44,810
That’s fine, so here’s our situation:
we don’t have a lot of warehousing space.

41
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,510
That means we can’t commit to a fixed schedule
for deliveries.

42
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,700
Instead, we’ll have to make orders once
our stock level is low enough and we have

43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,219
the space.

44
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,400
Hmm…

45
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,760
That’s possible.

46
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,330
One thing you should know: we won’t be able
to offer the lowest prices if we can’t be

47
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,959
sure of your delivery schedule in advance.

48
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,959
I understand.

49
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,810
And for one product category, for example
short-sleeved t-shirts, how many variations

50
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,200
of size and colour do you need?

51
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:25,370
We need all the common sizes, from XS to XXL,
each in 16 colours.

52
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,080
At the beginning of a negotiation, both sides
need to make their position clear.

53
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,169
In the dialogue, you saw several ways to do
this.

54
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:37,569
Can you remember any?

55
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:45,779
First, you can state what you want directly,
like this: ‘I suggest starting small and

56
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,800
scaling up later.'

57
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:56,200
‘We’re thinking of starting with around
500 units per SKU.’

58
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,969
‘We’d prefer to keep things flexible to
begin with.’

59
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:03,799
You can use this language in other ways.

60
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,460
For example: ‘I suggest a six-month contract
to begin with.’

61
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,360
‘We’re thinking of opening new branches
in 15 cities.’

62
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,890
‘We’d prefer to do the marketing work
ourselves.’

63
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:24,660
You can also ask the other side specific questions
to find out what they need.

64
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:31,100
In the dialogue, you heard: ‘What kind of
volumes are we looking at?’

65
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,480
‘What’s the situation regarding production
and delivery?’

66
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,760
Again, you could use these in different situations.

67
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,160
For example: ‘What kind of schedule are
we looking at?’

68
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,300
‘What’s the situation regarding minimum
order volume?’

69
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:57,030
Finally, you can also use open-ended questions
to check information, or to get more information

70
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:03,700
from the other side, like this: ‘What do
you have in mind exactly?’

71
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,050
‘And that would be per-month, or…?’

72
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:16,290
Making a question by leaving a sentence unfinished,
with the word ‘or’ at the end, is conversational.

73
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,460
You wouldn’t use it in writing.

74
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:25,080
However, in spoken English, it’s an effective
way of showing that you need more information,

75
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,310
and that you want the other person to finish
the idea.

76
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,110
Very often, negotiations depend on setting
conditions.

77
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,970
What *you* can offer depends on what the other
side can do.

78
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:46,560
Let’s see how you can talk about this.

79
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:55,120
OK, so if we’re ordering around 100,000
units at one time, what kind of per-unit pricing

80
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,770
can you offer?

81
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,130
That depends if you can commit to a regular
delivery schedule or not.

82
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,770
Assuming that you need a flexible schedule,
we could offer six dollars per unit for tees

83
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,250
and tank tops, and fifteen for hoodies and
zip-ups.

84
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,750
If we need higher volumes, would you be able
to go lower?

85
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,850
Possibly, but the schedule is more important
to us.

86
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,950
Supposing you could commit to a minimum monthly
volume, we could go down to five-fifty and

87
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,950
fourteen.

88
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:33,800
If we commit to a minimum volume over a six-month
period, but with a flexible delivery schedule,

89
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,260
could you offer us the same price?

90
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:41,280
As long as there were some limitations on
the delivery timing, I think that would be

91
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,520
acceptable.

92
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,310
The easiest way to express conditions is with
if-sentences.

93
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:55,030
For example: ‘If we’re ordering around
100,000 units at one time, what kind of per-unit

94
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,610
pricing can you offer?’

95
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:04,010
If we need higher volumes, would you be able
to go lower?’

96
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:12,110
If we commit to a minimum volume over a six-month
period, but with a flexible delivery schedule,

97
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,000
could you offer us the same price?’

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,030
If-sentences can be used in many ways; it’s
common to use the modal verbs ‘will’ ‘can’

99
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,710
‘could’ or ‘would’ on the other side
of the sentence.

100
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:34,890
Let’s make some more examples:
‘If we commit to a longer contract, can

101
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,600
you offer us a better price?’

102
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:45,260
‘If we agreed to pay the licensing costs,
would that make the deal work for you?’

103
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,010
However, there are other ways to talk about
conditions.

104
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:54,680
Can you remember any from the dialogue?

105
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,540
You heard: ‘Assuming that you need a flexible
schedule, we could offer six dollars per unit

106
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,060
for tees and tank tops…’

107
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:13,180
‘Supposing you could commit to a minimum
monthly volume, we could go down to five-fifty…’

108
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:19,540
‘As long as there were some limitations
on the delivery timing, I think that would

109
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,340
be acceptable.’

110
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:29,760
All of these have the same basic meaning,
which is like an if-sentence, although ‘assuming…’

111
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:37,370
and ‘supposing…’ are used when you want
to suggest something which is more speculative.

112
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:44,279
Using these shows that you’re talking about
possibilities, rather than very firm suggestions

113
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,420
which need to be accepted or rejected immediately.

114
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:56,880
‘As long as…’ has the opposite meaning;
it sets a very firm condition.

115
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,990
If you say, ‘As long as there were some
limitations on the delivery timing, I think

116
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:09,500
that would be acceptable’, you mean that
these limitations are necessary.

117
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,900
If you can reach an agreement, then that’s
great!

118
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:19,020
But, what if there’s a sticking point?

119
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,120
Let’s work out the details about delivery
and scheduling.

120
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,750
For us to make this work at the lower price,
we’d need to have monthly deliveries, but

121
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,370
we could let you adjust the size of the order
to some extent, so that you can manage your

122
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,470
warehousing space.

123
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,610
I’ll come right out and say that’s not
going to work for us.

124
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:45,970
Flexibility is essential for us; our whole
model is based on just-in-time logistics,

125
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,770
so there’s no way around this.

126
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:53,090
Well, in that case, we won’t be able to
offer you the lower price.

127
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:58,950
I have no problem with flexible deliveries
as such, but we can’t offer our best prices

128
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,470
without a regular commitment on your part.

129
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,390
I’m sorry to be blunt, but this seems a
little short-sighted on your part.

130
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:10,880
We’re potentially looking to order millions
of units each year.

131
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,060
Flexible delivery doesn’t mean that we won’t
make orders regularly, it just means that

132
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,700
we need to control the timing and quantities.

133
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:26,400
I understand completely, but you need to realise
that we have our own logistics issues to deal

134
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,450
with.

135
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:34,130
If we don’t know exactly when and how big
an order will be, that creates costs for us.

136
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:39,710
We’re not willing to absorb those costs;
I feel that if you need this flexibility,

137
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,850
then you should be willing to pay for it.

138
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,910
I’m sorry but I have to draw a line here.

139
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,310
It’s simply too risky for us to give you
what you’re asking.

140
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,490
It seems like we’ve reached a bit of an
impasse.

141
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,520
Shall we take a five-minute break?

142
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,720
Good idea.

143
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,970
If the other side makes a proposal which you
can’t accept, you can tell them directly,

144
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:08,760
like this: ‘We won’t be able to offer
you the lower price.’

145
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,660
‘We can’t offer our best prices without
a regular commitment on your part.’

146
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:20,560
‘We’re not willing to absorb those costs.’

147
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:28,730
This language is direct, but it’s often
better to be direct if something is important.

148
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,029
You can use this language in other ways.

149
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:38,700
For example: ‘We won’t be able to finish
the work in such a short space of time.’

150
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:44,540
‘We can’t sign a contract if you can’t
guarantee a delivery date.’

151
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,779
‘We’re not willing to share this technology
for free.’

152
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:55,010
You can also show that you disagree by using
phrases like: ‘I’ll come right out and

153
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,820
say that’s not going to work for us.’

154
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,800
‘There’s no way around this.’

155
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,540
‘I’m sorry but I have to draw a line here.’

156
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:13,050
These are general, so you can use them to
react to any suggestion which you strongly

157
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,060
disagree with.

158
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:22,800
It’s a good idea when negotiating to keep
things calm and avoid direct criticisms.

159
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:29,620
If things get confrontational, you could give
everyone space to cool off by saying: ‘Shall

160
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,420
we take a five-minute break?’

161
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:40,880
Next, let’s see how you can resolve disagreements
in a productive way.

162
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,570
Right, I’ve spoken to a few people and I
have a proposal which I hope can make this

163
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,000
work for everyone.

164
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,220
Sounds good!

165
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,220
What’s your idea?

166
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:54,060
The problem for us is that if you don’t
maintain a certain monthly volume, we might

167
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,860
lose money at the lower prices, which obviously
we can’t do.

168
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,860
Sure.

169
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,840
So, here’s my solution: we have an annual
contract with a flexible delivery schedule,

170
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,450
but with a minimum volume per-quarter.

171
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:14,070
At the end of the quarter, if you haven’t
met the volume requirements, you’re liable

172
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,830
for the difference in price between your orders
and the minimum.

173
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:25,510
I like the basic idea, but earlier I suggested
a six-month contract, and this sounds like

174
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,899
a much worse deal for us.

175
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:34,430
Well, I want to make this work, but the lower
prices only work if we can guarantee orders

176
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,440
over a full year.

177
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:43,060
I’ll make another offer: you pay five seventy-five
for tees and tank tops and fourteen-fifty

178
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,010
for hoodies and zip-up tops.

179
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:50,200
Then, you can have a six-month contract, with
minimum volume per-quarter.

180
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,640
That’s a good offer, but can we have the
minimum over the whole period, just to have

181
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:56,920
more flexibility?

182
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,890
I can’t make more concessions that I already
have, I’m afraid.

183
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,340
I think this is a good compromise which allows
us to move forwards.

184
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:10,500
I’ll need to call my team to confirm, but
I think this should be feasible.

185
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,340
Great!

186
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:18,000
When you’ve reached an impasse, you need
to make suggestions so that you can move forward.

187
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,230
To introduce a new idea, you heard this language
from the dialogue: ‘I have a proposal which

188
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,300
I hope can make this work for everyone.’

189
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,020
‘Here’s my solution: …’

190
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,600
'I'll make another offer...'

191
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,160
You can also ask the other side to suggest

192
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,020
their ideas, like this: ‘What’s your idea?’

193
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,600
‘What would you suggest?’

194
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,950
Then, you need to react to the other side’s
ideas.

195
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:58,080
If you agree, you could say something like,
‘That’s a good offer.’

196
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,560
‘I think this should be feasible.’

197
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,770
‘Feasible’ has a similar meaning to ‘possible’
or ‘practical’.

198
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:13,450
If something is ‘feasible’, it means that
you can do it, and it won’t be difficult

199
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,700
or problematic.

200
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,160
Hopefully, at this point you’ve managed
to reach an agreement!

201
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,740
If so, what else do you need to do?

202
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,750
Let’s go through the main points: you’ll
order a minimum of 500,000 units in a six-month

203
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:40,050
period, at a price of five seventy-five for
short-sleeved t-shirts, long-sleeved t-shirts

204
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:46,390
and tank tops, and fourteen-fifty for hoodies
and zip-up tops.

205
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,360
That’s right.

206
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:54,380
Regarding delivery, orders are flexible, but
you commit to giving us three weeks’ notice

207
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,090
for each order.

208
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,090
Yes.

209
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:02,120
We still need to settle the exact details
of sizes, colours, and so on.

210
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,320
Of course, but from our point of view, that
isn’t an issue.

211
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,519
Production costs are almost identical.

212
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,980
OK, so we can work that out later.

213
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:16,130
There’s also the matter of penalties in
case you don’t meet your minimum volume

214
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,209
over the course of the contract…

215
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:22,839
I thought we agreed that we would simply pay
the unit cost for the shortfall?

216
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:25,779
Yes, but which unit cost?

217
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:31,080
We need to agree separate minimums for the
t-shirts and tank tops, and for the heavier

218
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,080
items.

219
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,640
True, but I don’t see that being a problem.

220
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,200
No, me neither.

221
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:41,830
So, we’ll put this in writing and send you
a provisional agreement within the next few

222
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,080
days.

223
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,780
If everything looks OK, we can work on getting
a contract drawn up.

224
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,460
Perfect!

225
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:54,860
Once you’ve reached an agreement, you should
summarise what you’ve agreed, and then outline

226
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,300
the next steps which you both need to take.

227
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,569
You might also mention points which need to
be discussed later.

228
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:11,630
To summarise what you’ve agreed, you could
say, ‘Let’s go through the main points:

229
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,250
…’
‘Regarding delivery, …’

230
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,510
You can use ‘regarding’ to introduce a
new idea.

231
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:24,230
So, you could say, ‘Regarding the pricing…’

232
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:32,040
‘Regarding the timetable …’
…and so on.

233
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,250
If there’s something you need to talk about
later, you could say, ‘We still need to

234
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,820
settle the exact details of…’

235
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,360
'There’s also the matter of…’

236
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:52,140
These are flexible phrases, which you can
use to talk about many points, like this:

237
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,960
‘We still need to settle the exact details
of the training programme’

238
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:05,300
‘There’s also the matter of integration
with our existing software systems.’

239
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,460
Finally, you need to agree on the next steps.

240
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,360
You might say something like, ‘We’ll put
this in writing.’

241
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,120
‘We’ll send you a provisional agreement.’

242
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,280
‘We can work on getting a contract drawn
up.’

243
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:29,380
‘Draw up’ is a phrasal verb which means
‘write’, but it’s only used for contracts

244
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,900
and other legal documents.

245
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:38,660
Do you have any interesting experiences or
tips relating to business negotiations?

246
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:44,780
We’d love to hear from you, so please share
your ideas in the comments!

247
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,220
Thanks for watching!

248
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,029
See you next time!
