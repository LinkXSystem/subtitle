00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,409
Hi, I’m Stephanie.

2
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:06,720
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,580
In this lesson, you can learn about will,
might and would.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,400
Do you know the difference between will and
would?

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,760
What about the difference between might and
would?

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,110
In this lesson, you’ll learn what these
modal verbs mean, and how to use them correctly.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,430
One point: when we say might, we also mean
may.

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,390
Might and may are used in the same way, so
almost everything you hear about might is

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,989
also true about may.

10
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:46,989
In the few cases where might and may are used
differently, we’ll make it clear.

11
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:55,190
Let’s start by looking at the difference
between will and might.

12
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,020
Look at a pair of sentences:

13
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,809
I’ll go to a yoga class tonight.

14
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,720
I might go to a yoga class tonight.

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,220
What’s the difference?

16
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,950
The first sentence, with will, expresses certainty.

17
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:14,079
You’re 100% sure about your plans.

18
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,649
The second sentence, with might, expresses
possibility.

19
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:22,240
You’re not 100% sure about your plans.

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,189
It’s possible that you’ll go to a yoga
class, but it’s also possible that you’ll

21
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:28,539
do something else.

22
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:33,350
That’s the difference between will and might.

23
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,149
Both modal verbs are used to talk about the
future.

24
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:43,880
Will expresses certainty about the future,
while might expresses possibility, which in

25
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:51,939
a way is the opposite of certainty; possibility
means that you’re not certain about something.

26
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:54,109
Think about the negative forms:

27
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:57,869
I won’t go to a yoga class tonight.

28
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,520
I might not go to a yoga class tonight.

29
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,099
Can you see the difference here?

30
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:10,520
The answer is the same: using will or won’t
shows that you’re 100% sure about what will

31
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,320
happen.

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:19,120
Using might or might not shows that you aren’t
100% sure about what will happen.

33
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,640
Let’s see some more examples of this:

34
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,530
It will be hot next week.

35
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,920
You’re sure about this.

36
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,500
It might be hot next week.

37
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,640
It’s possible that it’ll be hot, but
you aren’t sure.

38
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,989
He won’t come unless you tell him several
weeks beforehand.

39
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,500
You’re sure about this.

40
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,500
He might not come unless you tell him several
weeks beforehand.

41
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:51,500
It’s possible that he won’t come in
this case, but you aren’t sure.

42
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,640
Next, let’s think about the difference between
will and would.

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,940
When you say,

44
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,440
It will be hot next week.

45
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,689
Or: It might be hot next week.

46
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:10,440
…you’re talking about the real future.

47
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,420
You think it’s possible that it will be
hot next week.

48
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,200
Even if you’re not sure, it’s still a
real possibility.

49
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,340
What do you mean, ‘real future’?

50
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,310
Is there another kind?

51
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,530
Glad you asked!

52
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,959
Yes, there is.

53
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,810
In English, you can also talk about the imaginary
future.

54
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,219
Let’s see how:

55
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:36,469
If I could go anywhere, I’d go to Nepal.

56
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:40,530
Who would you choose if it was up to you?

57
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,810
I’d never speak to you again if you told
her.

58
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,659
Look at these examples.

59
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,160
Do you know what ‘imaginary future’ means?

60
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,290
It means you’re imagining something in the
future, but you don’t think it will actually

61
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,870
happen in reality.

62
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,680
If I could go anywhere, I’d go to Nepal.

63
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,940
I can’t go anywhere, so I won’t go to
Nepal.

64
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,680
I’m just imagining it.

65
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,939
Who would you choose if it was up to you?

66
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:15,760
It’s not up to you, so you can’t choose.

67
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,870
I’m just asking you to imagine that it’s
your decision.

68
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,960
I’d never speak to you again if you told
her.

69
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,580
I don’t think you will tell her, so I don’t
think it’s realistic that I’ll never speak

70
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,580
to you again.

71
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,080
Of course, I could be wrong…

72
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,320
So, when you use will, you’re talking about
the real future.

73
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,090
You’re certain about something that is a
real possibility.

74
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,710
When you use would, you’re also certain,
but about the imaginary future.

75
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,780
You’re imagining a future, and you’re
sure about what would happen in that imaginary

76
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,780
future…

77
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,449
…but, you don’t think that imaginary future
will ever actually become reality.

78
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:04,580
Ok, now we’d like you to think about something.

79
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,830
Look at three sentences:

80
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,360
Even if you ask, I won’t help you.

81
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,470
Even if you asked, I wouldn’t help you.

82
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,880
If you asked, I would help you.

83
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:24,100
A question: which of these sentences means
that I will help you in the future?

84
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,080
Think about it.

85
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,270
Actually, that was a trick question.

86
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:36,540
All three sentences mean that I won’t help
you in the real future.

87
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,470
Did you get it right?

88
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,470
In our experience, many students get this
question wrong.

89
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,960
Either way, let’s explain the answer.

90
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,099
Even if you ask, I won’t help you.

91
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,599
This one is hopefully obvious.

92
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:57,310
If you say, I won’t, you’re talking about
the real future.

93
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:03,340
Even if you ask—in reality—I won’t help
you—in reality.

94
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,210
Even if you asked, I wouldn’t help you.

95
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,449
What’s the difference between this and the
first sentence?

96
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:15,540
The only difference is that I don’t think
you’ll ask me to help you.

97
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,350
You won’t ask me to help you, so I won’t
help you.

98
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,220
But, even if you asked, I still wouldn’t
help you.

99
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,569
Nice of me, right?

100
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:29,260
If you asked, I would help you.

101
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,080
This is the sentence that can cause problems.

102
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,220
Can you explain why this means that I won’t
help you, in reality, in the future?

103
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,949
This sentence is about the imaginary future.

104
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:46,680
Using would means that you don’t think this
situation will happen.

105
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,520
If you asked, I would help you, but I don’t
think you will ask, so I don’t think I will

106
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,120
help you.

107
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,280
This is an important point, and it can cause
misunderstandings—we’ve seen it happen

108
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,730
many times!

109
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:08,420
Let’s look at this in more detail.

110
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,470
Look at two sentences:

111
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,550
She won’t agree.

112
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,889
She would agree.

113
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,099
What’s the difference between them?

114
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:22,340
Hopefully, now you can answer that question.

115
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:29,710
The most important point is that in both sentences,
you mean that she won’t agree in reality.

116
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:35,659
In the first sentence, that’s all you’re
saying; you’re saying that she won’t agree

117
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:39,180
in the future, and you’re sure about that.

118
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,419
In the second sentence, you’re talking about
an imaginary future situation which exists

119
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,419
in your head.

120
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:51,950
You’re not talking about what you think
will happen in reality, so the basic meaning

121
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,349
is similar: she won’t agree in reality.

122
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:59,340
Urgh—so abstract!

123
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,639
Why are we making you think about this?

124
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,520
If you don’t understand this, you can very
easily misunderstand quite important points

125
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,139
when you’re speaking to someone in English.

126
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,389
For example, imagine you invite someone to
your birthday dinner.

127
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:16,750
The other person says:

128
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,099
Well, I would come…

129
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,479
You think, ‘Great!

130
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,560
This person’s coming!’

131
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,080
You walk away and continue making your birthday
plans.

132
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,560
Except, as you hopefully understood, they’re
not coming.

133
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,060
They left part of their sentence unsaid.

134
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,200
The full sentence might be something like:

135
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,980
I would come if I wasn’t so busy.

136
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,210
I would come if I was free.

137
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:51,700
I would come, but I don’t want to spend
any money on buying you a present.

138
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,170
You don’t know.

139
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,490
The point is: the other person won’t come
to your birthday dinner in reality.

140
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:03,420
And, reality is probably more important to
you, right?

141
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,450
Of course, this wouldn’t be a problem if
everybody was direct and said exactly what

142
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:15,470
they meant, but in the real world, people
are often indirect, and they don’t say exactly

143
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,280
what they mean.

144
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:25,220
Also, people usually speak with contractions:
I’ll, I’d, she’ll, she’d, etc.

145
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:31,610
It can be hard to hear the difference, but
the meaning can be totally opposite.

146
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:37,330
If you’re listening, and you’re not sure
if someone said I’ll or I’d, here’s

147
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,400
our advice: ask!

148
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,450
It’s important, because you could completely
misunderstand the situation.

149
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:51,000
We’ve talked a lot about will and would
here, but what about might?

150
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,620
Can you use might to talk about the imaginary
future?

151
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:03,870
You can use might to talk about the real future
or the imaginary future.

152
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,540
Look at three sentences:

153
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,320
It might snow next week.

154
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,870
He might have a different suggestion.

155
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,650
Taking the bus might not be the best way to
get there.

156
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,280
Are these sentences about the real future,
or not?

157
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,960
Is it possible that it will snow next week,
or not?

158
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,140
These sentences are about the real future.

159
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,880
They all describe real future possibilities
that you aren’t 100% sure about.

160
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,920
In a simple sentence like this, might is always
about real future possibilities.

161
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:49,380
However, you can also use might to talk about
the imaginary future, too.

162
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,220
Do you know how?

163
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,050
Here are some examples:

164
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,890
If I had more energy, I might join you.

165
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,730
He might not pay you back if you lent him
the money.

166
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,680
Can you see the difference?

167
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,870
You can use might to talk about the imaginary
future only in a sentence with if.

168
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:17,550
You also need to use a past tense verb after
if.

169
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,760
Think about something: what do these sentences
mean?

170
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,620
The first sentence means that I don’t have
more energy, so I won’t join you, but I’m

171
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,110
imagining a future in which I have more energy,
and even in that imaginary future, I’m not

172
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,430
100% sure I would join you.

173
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:42,370
Clearly, whatever you’re inviting me to
isn’t very exciting.

174
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,200
He might not pay you back if you lent him
the money.

175
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,640
I don’t think you’ll actually lend him
the money in reality, but I’m imagining

176
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:56,350
a future where you do lend him the money,
and in that imaginary future, I’m not 100%

177
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,130
sure whether he would pay you back or not.

178
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:04,300
Finally, this is one case where might and
may are different.

179
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,110
You can’t use may in these sentences to
talk about the imaginary future.

180
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,940
Only might is possible.

181
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:18,720
Up to now, you’ve seen how to use will,
might and would to talk about the future.

182
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:24,490
But, what about the past?

183
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:29,700
First of all, you can’t generally use will
to talk about the past.

184
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,430
There are one or two cases where you can,
but it’s rare.

185
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:39,170
Generally, will is about the future, or sometimes
the present.

186
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:45,980
You can use would or might to talk about imaginary
past situations.

187
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,960
What does ‘imaginary past’ mean?

188
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,220
Like the imaginary future, it means you imagine
a past which didn’t happen.

189
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,300
For example, let’s say that you studied
history at university.

190
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,000
You want to imagine a past where you studied
medicine instead.

191
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,810
You might say something like:

192
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:11,610
If I’d studied medicine, I would have become
a doctor.

193
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:17,160
I might have been more interested in my studies
if I’d studied medicine.

194
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,580
In these cases, you’re imagining a different
past.

195
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,470
You didn’t study medicine; you studied history.

196
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,220
But, what if you had studied medicine?

197
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,430
Imagine it; that’s the situation these sentences
are describing.

198
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:40,440
A question: what do you need to add after
would or might to make the meaning past?

199
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,600
You need to add have and a past participle
verb.

200
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Also, when talking about the imaginary past,
you almost always use an if-sentence.

201
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,760
Let’s see some more examples:

202
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,550
I would have bought you a present if I’d
known it was your birthday!

203
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:06,240
If I had missed the train, we might never
have met!

204
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,220
Next question: can you explain what these
sentences mean?

205
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,000
Let’s look together.

206
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:18,120
The first sentence is imagining a different
past.

207
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,080
In reality, I didn’t know it was your birthday,
and I didn’t buy you a present.

208
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,000
But, I’m imagining a different past, where
I knew it was your birthday.

209
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,250
In that imaginary past, I’m 100% sure I
would have bought you a present.

210
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,160
The second sentence is also imagining a different
past.

211
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,920
In reality, I didn’t miss the train, so
we did meet.

212
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,580
However, in my imaginary past, I missed the
train.

213
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:55,830
In this imaginary situation, I’m not 100%
sure whether we would have met or not.

214
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:02,350
Maybe we would have met somewhere else, or
on another day, but maybe not.

215
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,100
You can see that these sentences contain a
lot of information!

216
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:13,360
However, you only really need to think about
two (or maybe three) things:

217
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,030
One: are you 100% sure or not 100% sure?

218
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,320
If you’re 100% sure, use will or would.

219
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,600
If not, use might.

220
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,710
Two: are you talking about real life, or an
imaginary situation?

221
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,520
If you’re talking about real life, use will
or might.

222
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,820
If you’re talking about an imaginary situation,
use would or might.

223
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:45,150
The final thing: you need to think about whether
you’re talking about the future or the past.

224
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:50,930
However, this doesn’t change which verb
you should use; it just changes how you should

225
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,290
use them.
