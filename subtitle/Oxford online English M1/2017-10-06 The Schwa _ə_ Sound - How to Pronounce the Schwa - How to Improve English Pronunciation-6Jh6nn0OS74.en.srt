00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,020
Hi, my name's Sam.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,310
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:12,260
In this lesson you can learn about the most
common sound in English.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,279
What is the most common sound in English?

5
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:19,180
The most common sound in English is called
the schwa.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,610
Do you know what a schwa sounds like, or how
to pronounce it?

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:31,720
In this class, you’ll learn about the schwa,
how to recognise it and how to pronounce it.

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,650
The schwa sound is pronounced like this: /ə/

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,820
It’s a very short, relaxed sound.

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:47,540
Just open your mouth a little, relax everything,
and let out a little bit of air: /ə/.

11
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,990
Let’s play a quick game.

12
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,030
Look at a sentence I just said:

13
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,230
In this lesson, you can learn about the most
common sound in English.

14
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:12,020
How many schwa sounds are there in this sentence?

15
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,350
It’s somewhere between zero and five.

16
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,850
Have a guess.

17
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,549
Go back and listen once more if you want to.

18
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,629
In this less/ə/n, you c/ə/n learn /ə/bout
th/ə/ most comm/ə/n sound in English.

19
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:33,500
You can see that I used the schwa sound five
times in just one short sentence.

20
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:40,080
So, now you know what the schwa is, but why
is it so important?

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,340
It’s helpful to know about the schwa sound
because recognising it will improve your listening

22
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,090
and being able to produce the sound will improve
your pronunciation.

23
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,369
But, learning about the schwa can be difficult,
because speakers of English use schwas in

24
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:03,650
different places, depending on their accent
and depending on which words the speaker chooses

25
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,549
to stress.

26
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:13,140
That means that you’ll hear different people
use schwa sounds differently.

27
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:20,340
I might use a schwa in a word, but another
native speaker might not.

28
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,480
So you know, I’m from the South of England,
and you’ll find that most speakers from

29
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,050
the South of England use the schwa in a similar
way.

30
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:38,829
Let’s start by looking at how you can hear
and recognise schwa sounds.

31
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:45,890
Here’s the IPA symbol for the schwa sound:
/ə/

32
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,809
It looks like an upside-down “e”.

33
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:56,819
This will help you to understand how to pronounce
words when you see them in a dictionary.

34
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,950
For example:

35
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,090
understand
/ʌndəˈstænd/

36
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:08,249
It’s helpful to use the schwa symbol when
you write down new vocabulary.

37
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:18,389
Write the schwa symbol under the letter or
letters where it appears.

38
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:24,200
That can help you to recognise the schwa sound
in new words, but what if you can’t check

39
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,939
the dictionary?

40
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:32,739
Even if you can’t check a word in the dictionary,
you can still find many schwa sounds in new

41
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:33,739
words.

42
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:37,830
Let’s see how.

43
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,959
The spelling of a word doesn’t help you
much if you’re trying to work out where

44
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:43,879
the schwa sounds might be.

45
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,059
Why is that?

46
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:51,480
It’s because schwa sounds don’t really
depend on spelling.

47
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:59,469
Also, schwa sounds can be produced by any
vowel letter: a, e, i, o or u.

48
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:01,870
For example:

49
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,939
/ə/bout
tel/ə/vision

50
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:10,010
medic/ə/ne
comm/ə/n

51
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,049
minim/ə/m

52
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:18,030
The schwa can also be produced by two or three
letters together, like this:

53
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,180
gov/ə/nment
press/ə/

54
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,760
cert/ə/n

55
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:30,800
So, the spelling won’t help you to find
a schwa, but the stress will; how?

56
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,470
One of the most important things to understand
about the schwa is that it only appears in

57
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,990
unstressed syllables.

58
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,490
Knowing which syllable is stressed in a word
can help you to find where the schwa sounds

59
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,880
are.

60
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,310
The schwa can appear at the beginning, middle
or end of a word, depending on where the stress

61
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,340
is.

62
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,400
/ə/bout
Und/ə/stand

63
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,440
Teach/ə/

64
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,830
You heard before that stress is more useful
than spelling if you’re looking for the

65
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,410
schwa sounds in a word.

66
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:17,650
That’s true, but there are some spelling
patterns which can help you to find a schwa

67
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,670
sound.

68
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,690
Let’s look!

69
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:27,200
One: if a word begins with the letter ‘a’
plus a consonant, the ‘a’ is often pronounced

70
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,490
with a schwa sound: about, across, address.

71
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,970
Of course, if the word begins with ‘a’
and ‘a’ is stressed, the ‘a’ will

72
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,850
not have a schwa sound.

73
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:45,460
For example: able, actor, artist.

74
00:05:45,460 --> 00:06:00,950
Two: In a British accent, word endings such
as –er, - ar, -or, –our, or -ure, are

75
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:19,900
very often pronounced with a schwa sound:
teacher, dollar, visitor, colour, culture.

76
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:26,500
This rule is useful and will work most of
the time; however there are some exceptions,

77
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:38,950
such as guitar, insure, metaphor or flour.

78
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:49,360
Three: in words ending -ion or -ian, the letters
‘ia’ or ‘io’ always have a schwa sound:

79
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,950
politician, pronunciation, correction, musician,
discussion.

80
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:01,740
The same is true for words ending -ous, like
dangerous, nervous, or fabulous.

81
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:07,430
There are other spelling patterns, but these
are some of the most useful.

82
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:19,600
Next, let’s see how you can recognise schwa
sounds in phrases and sentences.

83
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,980
In almost every English sentence you hear,
there will be at least one schwa sound, and

84
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,330
probably more.

85
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:31,300
Let’s look at a sentence you probably use
often:

86
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,639
How are you?

87
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,480
Which words would normally be stressed in
this sentence?

88
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,910
Say it to yourself.

89
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,570
Can you work it out?

90
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:47,730
In this sentence, the stress is on how and
you.

91
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:55,639
The unstressed word in this sentence is are
and it is pronounced as a schwa sound.

92
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,730
Listen and try to hear it:

93
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,919
How /ə/ you?

94
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:09,020
So, how do you know which words are stressed
or unstressed?

95
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:16,940
The unstressed words in a sentence are usually
auxiliary words, articles and prepositions.

96
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:24,060
Words which carry the meaning of a sentence—nouns,
verbs, adjectives and adverbs—are often

97
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,090
stressed.

98
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,180
Let’s look at some examples:

99
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,560
Do you like learning English?

100
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:38,249
In this sentence, the stressed words are like,
learning and English and there are no schwas

101
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:40,399
in those words.

102
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,220
The unstressed words are do and you and they
will often be pronounced as schwas.

103
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,220
Listen:

104
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,370
D/ə/ y/ə/ like learning English?

105
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:59,600
However, sometimes you might choose to stress
different words in a sentence.

106
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:07,230
If you hadn’t seen a friend for a long time,
you might stress are in this sentence.

107
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,629
If you do this, the schwa sound is replaced
with a longer vowel sound.

108
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:15,629
How /ɑ:/ you?

109
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:23,810
Look again at the question: Do you like learning
English?

110
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:31,440
If you want to make it clear who you’re
asking the question to, you can stress you,

111
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,230
which again makes the vowel sound longer:

112
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,459
D/ə/ y/ʊ:/

113
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:38,959
like learning English?

114
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,829
Here’s a phrase you might hear a lot in
the UK:

115
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:47,309
/ə/ cup of tea

116
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:51,339
The article a has a schwa sound.

117
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:57,589
However, if someone brought me two cups of
tea when I only wanted one, I might stress

118
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:00,010
a, like this:

119
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,700
I said I wanted /eɪ/ cup of tea.

120
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,920
Recognising the schwa can also help you understand
connected speech.

121
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,999
Let’s see how:

122
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:15,319
/ə/ cup of tea

123
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:21,680
Most English learners would find it easy to
understand this phrase when each word is pronounced

124
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,120
clearly.

125
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:33,080
However, in natural speech, the phrase might
sound more like this: /əkʌpəti:/

126
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:40,960
Here, a cup of becomes 'a cuppa', so of is
reduced to a schwa.

127
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,529
a cuppa tea
/əkʌpəti:/

128
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:46,330
Let’s practise together.

129
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,620
Repeat the phrases after me:

130
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:57,540
How /ə/ you?

131
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:06,740
D/ə/ y/ə/ like learning English?

132
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:13,369
/ə/ cup /ə/f tea

133
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:19,170
Being aware of schwas in connected speech
can really improve your English listening.

134
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,680
You can see that words and sentences are not
pronounced as they’re written.

135
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,850
Learning and practising schwa sounds can help
you to understand this.

136
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:37,619
Of course, using schwas and connected speech
in your English will also help you to sound

137
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:39,999
more fluent and natural!

138
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:50,740
Finally, let’s practise pronouncing the
schwa in words and sentences.

139
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,759
Look at some words and try to find the schwa
sounds.

140
00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:00,370
Pause the video, write the words down and
mark the stressed syllables.

141
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,670
Then say the word and see if you can identify
the schwa.

142
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,629
Write the schwa symbol under the vowel.

143
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:09,649
Ready?

144
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:11,680
Let’s check.

145
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,900
Say the words after me:

146
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,200
picture, pict/ə/

147
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,640
around, /ə/round

148
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,800
smaller, small/ə/

149
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,120
horror, horr/ə/

150
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,780
national, nat/ə/n/ə/l

151
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:47,140
similar, simil/ə/r

152
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,820
temperature, temper/ə/t/ə/

153
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,980
celebration, cel/ə/brat/ə/n

154
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,340
happiness, happin/ə/ss

155
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,820
America, /ə/meric/ə/

156
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,700
Next, let’s try some phrases.

157
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:20,660
As before, pause the video, write the phrases
down and find the schwa sounds:

158
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,180
Ok?

159
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,260
Let’s check.

160
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,540
Say the phrases after me:

161
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:31,840
a slice of cake,
/ə/ slice /ə/f cake

162
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:39,940
a cat and a dog,
/ə/ cat /ə/nd /ə/ dog

163
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:47,200
an apple and a banana,
/ə/n apple /ə/nd /ə/ b/ə/nan/ə/

164
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,249
Next, let’s do some full sentences.

165
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:58,500
Again, pause the video, write the sentences
down and find the schwa sounds.

166
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,820
Ready?

167
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,460
Now, let’s check.

168
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,800
Repeat after me:

169
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,160
Where are you from?

170
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,600
Where /ə/ y/ə/ from?

171
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,740
What's your favourite film?

172
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,100
What’s y/ə/ fav/ə/r/ə/te film?

173
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,149
What time do you get up?

174
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:26,840
What time d/ə/ y/ə/ get up?

175
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,460
That’s the end of this lesson.

176
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:36,300
I hope you learned something new about how
to recognise and produce the schwa sound in

177
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,690
English.
