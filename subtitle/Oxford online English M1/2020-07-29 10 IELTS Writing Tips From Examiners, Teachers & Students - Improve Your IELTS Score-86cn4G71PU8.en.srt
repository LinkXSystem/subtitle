00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,350
Hi, I’m Martin.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,700
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:13,400
In this lesson, you can get ten essential
tips for your IELTS writing exam.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,640
How’s this video different?

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:22,900
Well, we collected feedback from students
who took IELTS, and also interviewed IELTS

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,800
examiners.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,580
Our aim is to give you the most up-to-date
IELTS advice, and also give you tips which

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,480
you might not find elsewhere.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,390
We’ve also included our own top tips, which
we’ve developed through teaching hundreds

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,930
of IELTS candidates.

11
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:47,410
You can study with us too, if you want; book
classes on Oxford Online English dot com.

12
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:52,020
One more thing, do you want English subtitles
while watching this video?

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,640
Turn them on now if you like.

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:04,640
If your overall IELTS score is between two
bands, your score is rounded up.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:14,250
For example, if you score 7-7-7-6 in the four
sections, you’ll get band seven overall.

16
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,280
In the writing exam, it probably doesn’t
work the same way.

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,880
Why ‘probably’?

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,270
Well, there’s no clear information publicly
available, and even the examiners we spoke

19
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,340
to weren’t sure.

20
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:35,640
However, according to the best information
we have: if you score seven for task achievement,

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,900
seven for coherence/cohesion, seven for vocabulary
and six for grammar in your writing exam,

22
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,439
that will be rounded *down* to 6.5.

23
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,140
What does this mean for you?

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,030
It means that you can’t have any major weaknesses.

25
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:03,580
If your target score is seven, you probably
need to score seven in all four areas.

26
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,810
Do you make multiple small grammar errors
when you write?

27
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,909
This will likely limit your grammar score
to six.

28
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:20,060
If you get one score of six, then getting
band seven overall becomes much more difficult.

29
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:29,230
OK, if you score band eight in one area, then
you can score band six somewhere else and

30
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,300
still get seven.

31
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,980
However, it’s rare that we see students
with some scores much higher than others.

32
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:45,420
Generally, the four scores – TA, C&C, vocabulary
and grammar – are close together.

33
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:53,900
So, if your target score is, for example,
seven, you need to aim for seven in all four

34
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,189
areas.

35
00:02:55,189 --> 00:03:00,659
Find your weakest area, find out what you
need to do to hit your target score, and give

36
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,269
it extra focus when preparing.

37
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:11,639
In the past, IELTS examiners would count how
many words you had written, and apply a penalty

38
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,590
to your TA score if you hadn’t written enough.

39
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,830
They no longer do this.

40
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,709
No one will count your words.

41
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,650
So, you shouldn’t do this in the exam, either.

42
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,139
Why did they change?

43
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:32,059
The idea is that you can’t write a full
answer while writing less than the word count,

44
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:37,620
and this will be reflected in your TA score
anyway; there’s no need for an extra word

45
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,249
count penalty.

46
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:46,719
So, focus on writing full, well-developed
answers which answer every part of the task.

47
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,889
Don’t worry about word count.

48
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,920
This applies to the exam.

49
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,709
When practising, you should count your words.

50
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,519
However, don’t focus on the word count as
a number.

51
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:04,629
If you find it difficult to meet the word
count, this strongly suggests that you aren’t

52
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:06,900
answering the task fully.

53
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,580
Ask yourself: what could you add?

54
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,870
What ideas could you explain in more depth?

55
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:20,720
How long do you think the examiner will spend
reading your writing?

56
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,940
It depends, but the basic answer is: “not
long.”

57
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:34,020
Examiners we spoke to said they spent around
five minutes per task on average; one mentioned

58
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:39,270
that he has heard of examiners spending only
three minutes per task.

59
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:45,650
If I’m marking some IELTS writing, I need
ten to fifteen minutes to do a thorough job.

60
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:51,569
If the examiner is spending only five minutes
– or less – then they’re not reading

61
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:53,990
everything carefully.

62
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,550
What does this mean for you?

63
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,100
It means you should follow obvious strategies.

64
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:06,820
Don’t experiment; give the examiner what
they’re expecting to see.

65
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:14,120
For example, in general task one, write a
separate paragraph for each bullet point in

66
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:15,770
the task.

67
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:22,540
In academic task one, put your overview in
a separate paragraph near the start of your

68
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,520
answer.

69
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:32,800
In task two, start each body paragraph with
a clear topic sentence.

70
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,070
You don’t *have* to do these things to get
high scores, but most people follow these

71
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,370
methods.

72
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,860
If you take a different approach, examiners
might not take the time to read your work

73
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,810
carefully and understand what you’re doing.

74
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,460
Keep it simple!

75
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:57,259
It’s hopefully obvious that if you can’t
write a high-scoring IELTS answer in two hours,

76
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:01,060
then you can’t do it in one hour, either.

77
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:08,250
Often, IELTS students try to write with a
time limit, like in the exam.

78
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,020
Of course, the time limit is important.

79
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:18,180
But, if your writing has problems, then you
should fix the problems first, and worry about

80
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,650
the time later.

81
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:28,520
For example, many IELTS students we meet have
big problems with TA in task two.

82
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,110
Often, the problems relate to planning and
organising ideas.

83
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,180
When we start practising, it’s common for
students to need thirty minutes – or sometimes

84
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,360
longer – just to *plan* one task two answer.

85
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,650
If this is your situation, then don’t worry
about time limits at first.

86
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,800
Focus on writing an answer at your target
band score.

87
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,800
If it takes three hours, then OK.

88
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:07,480
Once you can *consistently* hit your target
band score, then start training for speed.

89
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:16,400
Here’s a common question which IELTS students
ask: how do I get ideas for my essay in task

90
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,200
two?

91
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,090
I don’t know.

92
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,930
You need to solve that problem.

93
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:28,849
If you’re in the exam, and you read the
task two question, and you think “I don’t

94
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,949
have anything to say about this”, then you’re
in a bad position.

95
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:37,080
There’s not much that can help you at that
moment.

96
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,009
You need to prepare for this *before* the
exam.

97
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:44,499
So, what should you do?

98
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:51,300
First, read as many task two questions as
you can, and think about them.

99
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,129
Second, if you don’t have a strong opinion,
then try to find some news articles on the

100
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:59,220
same topic.

101
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,620
Read articles with different opinions, and
think about what you do or don’t agree with,

102
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,169
and why.

103
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:12,409
If you have someone to practise speaking with,
then debating is also helpful.

104
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,969
Take a topic; you and your partner choose
one side each.

105
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:22,569
Then, you have a debate, you try to support
your side and argue against your partner’s

106
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:23,569
points.

107
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:31,809
Third, here’s a useful exercise: take a
task two question and write two practice essays

108
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:33,540
on opposite sides.

109
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:37,940
For example, look at this question.

110
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,459
To practise, write two essays.

111
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:48,399
The first argues that climate change is the
most serious environmental problem facing

112
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:56,500
humanity, and the second argues that other
environmental issues are equally serious.

113
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,600
Sound like a lot of work?

114
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,020
It is!

115
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:07,360
But, to score seven or higher in task two,
you need detailed, well-supported ideas in

116
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,920
your essay.

117
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,600
There’s no short cut.

118
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:19,680
A question: what score will you get if your
essay is not 100% on topic?

119
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,480
IELTS examiners have a term: ‘on-topic,
off-task’.

120
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,389
They use this for essays which are in the
right general area, but which don’t answer

121
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:32,680
the question directly.

122
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:41,570
Such essays are limited to band four for TA,
and five for C&C, *maximum.* This problem

123
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,580
applies to many of the IELTS essays we see
from our students.

124
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,210
You must train yourself to read the question
carefully.

125
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:55,400
Think about *every single word*.

126
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:02,360
For example, look at the task two you saw
just now.

127
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:11,170
Before you can even think about this question,
you need to think about some of the ideas.

128
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:20,670
For example, what do ‘serious’ and ‘important’
mean here?

129
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:29,940
What does it mean for one environmental problem
to be more serious than another?

130
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,350
What are ‘other environmental issues’?

131
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,460
These are not simple questions.

132
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:44,590
We often see IELTS students who start writing
without thinking about these things.

133
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:49,860
Then, they write an on-topic, off-task essay.

134
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,640
It’s easy to do.

135
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,130
You might be watching this thinking: “That
wouldn’t happen to me!”

136
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,130
It might.

137
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:02,930
It’s one of the biggest and most common
problems we see.

138
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,480
Look at a task two question.

139
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,610
Now, look at a different version.

140
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,600
Can you see the difference?

141
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:21,560
In the task two instructions, it matters whether
a word is singular or plural.

142
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:29,670
For example, if the task asks you to describe
‘the main problem’, then you need to focus

143
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,640
on one, and only one, problem.

144
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:41,810
If the task asks you to describe ‘problems’,
then you should include at least two.

145
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:48,520
The same is true with other words you’ll
see in many IELTS questions, like ‘benefits’,

146
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,120
‘advantages’, ‘disadvantages’, and
so on.

147
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:59,540
Pay attention to whether the word is singular
or plural.

148
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:06,779
Stronger answers – band eight or nine – tend
to be longer, especially in task two.

149
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:15,149
It’s quite difficult to write a full, well-developed
essay answer in only 250 words.

150
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:19,089
Remember also that there’s no upper limit.

151
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:26,300
Of course, you need to be careful that your
essay is well-organised, with logical paragraphing

152
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,319
and a clear progression from the beginning
to the end.

153
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:38,460
So, if you’re aiming for higher scores – 7.5
or above – you should probably be aiming

154
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,740
to write a longer response in task 2.

155
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,000
Writing more allows you to develop your ideas
in more depth and

156
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
use a wider range of vocabulary -

157
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,260
both of which are necessary for the highest band.

158
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:00,820
Sometimes, you’ll hear IELTS advice like
‘your ideas don’t matter, so long as they’re

159
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,980
relevant’, or ‘it doesn’t matter if
what you write is true or not’.

160
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,529
We might even have said similar things in
the past!

161
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:18,069
This advice is true to a point; if your target
is band six, then sure, this advice is fine.

162
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:23,980
If you’re aiming for higher scores – seven
and higher – then you can’t think like

163
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,040
this.

164
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,500
Your ideas matter.

165
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,100
Not all relevant ideas are equal.

166
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:38,319
Ideas which are more focused, more detailed,
and better-supported are better for your TA

167
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:39,709
score.

168
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:46,410
If you’re aiming for band seven plus, you
should approach your task two essay in this

169
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:52,590
way: imagine you’re writing for someone
who has the opposite opinion to you, and you

170
00:13:52,590 --> 00:14:00,070
*really* want to convince them to change their
mind.

171
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:05,389
We sometimes see questions about academic
task one like: “How do I deal with a bar

172
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:06,709
chart question?”

173
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:09,240
“What do I do with a map question?”

174
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,920
And so on.

175
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,610
Actually, you can approach all academic task
one questions the same way.

176
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:23,000
Imagine you’re writing for someone who can’t
see the chart, or the map, or whatever.

177
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,820
Now, imagine that this person is going to
read what you’ve written, and try to draw

178
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:31,000
the chart.

179
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,600
Can this imaginary person do it?

180
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,699
Can they recreate the chart, using only what
you’ve written?

181
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:50,360
If they can, then you’ve written a high-scoring
answer, at least for TA and probably C&C.

182
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,920
So, don’t overthink it.

183
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,860
Write your answer with this idea in your head.

184
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,260
Your task one writing will improve immediately.

185
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,610
We’ve seen this work with many students!

186
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,100
Wait, what?

187
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,379
Only one task one tip?

188
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:16,940
IELTS students don’t generally have so many
problems with task one, either academic or

189
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,980
general.

190
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,360
And, the problems they do have are relatively
easy to fix.

191
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,720
So yes, we only have one major task one tip.

192
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,240
But OK, here are two quick bonus tips for
task one.

193
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:40,829
For task one general, the most common problem
we see is tone – meaning how formal or informal

194
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:43,379
your language is.

195
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:49,370
People either write in an inappropriate tone
– in most cases, this means using language

196
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:57,810
which is too formal for the task – or, they
mix formal and informal language in their

197
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,810
answer.

198
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:07,420
For high task one scores, your tone needs
to be both appropriate and consistent.

199
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:14,139
For task one academic, learn some phrases
to describe statistics and figures.

200
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:20,910
Many academic task ones are quite similar:
you need to describe trends and data.

201
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:27,290
This requires a limited range of language,
which you can – and should – prepare for.

202
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:33,180
For example, do you know any words which have
the same meaning as ‘increase’?

203
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,460
What’s the difference between ‘rise’
and ‘raise’?

204
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,980
Finding the answers to these questions will
help you to write a better task one answer

205
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,310
in the academic writing exam.

206
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,680
That’s all.

207
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,339
Thanks for watching!

208
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:49,060
See you next time!
