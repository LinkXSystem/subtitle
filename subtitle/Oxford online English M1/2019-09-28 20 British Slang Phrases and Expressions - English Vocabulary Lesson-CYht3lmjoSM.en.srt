00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,360
Hi, my name’s Olivier.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,980
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,820
In this lesson, you can learn about British
slang.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:14,210
If I told you I was feeling knackered today,
would you know I meant?

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:20,970
If I asked you to buy some bog roll on your
way home, would you know what I wanted?

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,869
Confused?

7
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:28,160
These are example of British slang, and they
can be difficult for non-native speakers to

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,170
understand and use correctly.

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,630
But don’t worry, we’re going to help.

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,969
Well, you’re going to help.

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,089
I’m from the US, and we don’t understand
some British slang.

12
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:42,629
Anyway, what is slang?

13
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:48,459
Slang phrases can cover any topic, and are
mostly used in informal contexts.

14
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:53,019
In this lesson, you’ll see dialogues with
slang words and phrases connected to four

15
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,979
different topics.

16
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,320
Our first topic?

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,820
Food.

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,430
At the start of the next section.

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,019
You’ll see a dialogue with four slang words
and phrases.

20
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:09,160
Try to hear them and write them down as you
listen!

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,140
Hey, wanna get lunch?

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,840
Yeah, I was starting to feel a little peckish.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,520
Did you have anywhere in mind?

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,540
I still don’t know what there is around
here.

25
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,530
Well, there’s a cafe around the corner,
or we could splash out and go to that new

26
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,530
gastro pub.

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,030
It’s a bit pricier, but they do have really
nice food.

28
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,060
Shall we do the pub?

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,409
Yeah, why not?

30
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,470
I skipped breakfast, and I’m absolutely
starving.

31
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,570
I could murder a burger.

32
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,909
They do this burger with mint and feta cheese.

33
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,380
It’s amazing!

34
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,680
It’s so good, I almost have to slow myself
down and enjoy it, otherwise I just wolf it

35
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:43,689
down!

36
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,299
Sounds like you need to get there fast.

37
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,649
Ready to go now?

38
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:51,720
Did you hear the slang words and phrases?

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,329
The first two you heard were ‘peckish’
and ‘splash out’.

40
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:58,729
What do you think they mean?

41
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:02,439
If you are ‘peckish’ you’re a little
hungry, but not very hungry.

42
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:08,179
Maybe you’re not hungry enough to eat a
full meal, but you want a snack.

43
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:13,980
‘Splash out’ means to spend more on something
than you usually would.

44
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:20,239
In the dialogue, we were choosing between
a cheap cafe or a more expensive pub.

45
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,760
In the end, we decided to splash out on a
pub lunch.

46
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,540
But, remember that this is not normal spending.

47
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,610
You can’t splash out if you always spend
that amount of money.

48
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,180
The second two slang phrases were, ‘I could
murder a …’ and ‘wolf it down’.

49
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,680
The full phrase in the dialogue was ‘I could
murder a burger.’

50
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,740
What do these mean?

51
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,220
If you say ‘I could murder a burger’,
it means you really, really want a burger

52
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,810
right now.

53
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,129
You can use it with other food and drink.

54
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:03,180
For example, you can say ‘I could murder
a pint’, or ‘I could murder some chips

55
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,840
right now.’

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,040
What about ‘wolf it down’?

57
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:10,829
If you wolf something down, you eat it very
fast.

58
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:16,150
Imagine how a wolf might eat a hamburger;
it’s not going to eat slowly and politely!

59
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:25,680
Next, let’s look at some slang phrases you
can use to describe people and how they act.

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,120
Hey, how was the party last week?

61
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
Did you have fun?

62
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,239
It was OK for a while, but then things went
downhill.

63
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,689
Oh, what happened?

64
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,200
You know John?

65
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,269
He brought this really smarmy guy with him.

66
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:43,810
He was trying to hit on all the women, starting
arguments, and generally being annoying.

67
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,909
Anyway, I got stuck talking to him for ages.

68
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:48,920
I think I heard about this from Paula.

69
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,290
Yes, what a horrible guy!

70
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,980
Then finally Paula told him to leave and he
threw a huge wobbly!

71
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,370
He was shouting at everyone and being totally
obnoxious.

72
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,370
It ruined the atmosphere.

73
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,810
I think I’d gone home by that point.

74
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,470
He completely lost the plot.

75
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,109
Paula was pretty pissed off at John for bringing
him.

76
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:08,129
Did you manage to talk to Paula at all?

77
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:09,969
She’s such a nice person.

78
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:12,819
I wanted you two to meet ‘cos I’m sure
you’ll get along.

79
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,849
I did a little, but only after everything
had happened.

80
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:19,380
She was upset, so I guess she didn’t feel
like talking much.

81
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,580
That’s a shame.

82
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,900
She’s normally so chatty!

83
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,550
I can imagine.

84
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,910
She seemed full of beans earlier in the evening.

85
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,630
I like her; she’s one of those people who,
if you’re in a bad mood, you talk to her

86
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,280
and you feel better.

87
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,300
Yeah…

88
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,230
Hopefully next time I meet her it’ll be
in better circumstances.

89
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:43,040
Again, there were four slang words and phrases
in the dialogue.

90
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,810
Did you hear them?

91
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,450
Can you remember them now?

92
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,290
These were the words and phrases you heard.

93
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,500
What do they mean?

94
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,860
Remember that you can always go back and repeat
parts of the lesson.

95
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,520
If you want, go back and listen to the dialogue
again, and try to understand the words in

96
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,600
context.

97
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,060
‘Smarmy’ refers to somebody who is unpleasantly
polite.

98
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:17,330
You can use it for someone who is polite and
friendly, but in a fake, insincere way.

99
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,740
You can also use the word ‘slimy’ which
has a similar meaning.

100
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,900
‘Lose the plot’ means to go crazy.

101
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,310
You might use it if somebody who is really
stressed starts behaving strangely, or starts

102
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,100
making some strange decisions.

103
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,210
For example, you could say: ‘Steve has absolutely
lost the plot.

104
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:44,260
He’s been driving around the same three
streets for twenty minutes!’

105
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,970
‘Throw a wobbly’ means to become very
angry or agitated very quickly.

106
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:54,940
A more neutral phrase with the same meaning
is ‘throw a tantrum’, which we often use

107
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,920
to describe children who lose control of themselves
and get very angry.

108
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:06,260
‘Full of beans’ describes a person who
is full of life and energetic.

109
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:12,760
For example: ‘Mark is full of beans today;
he got great results in his exams and he can’t

110
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,220
stop smiling!’

111
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,460
In our next section, you'll see some slang phrases to talk about situations

112
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:26,920
which went especially well or especially badly. Let's look.

113
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,440
You look a bit stressed.

114
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
Everything OK?

115
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,580
Yeah, it’ll be fine.

116
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,500
There was a bit of a cock up with our invoicing.

117
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,190
Nothing too serious, I hope?

118
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,270
Not too bad.

119
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,180
We just sent things to the wrong people.

120
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,900
It’s a bit embarrassing, but I’ll write
a couple of apologetic emails and everything

121
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,420
will be hunky dory.

122
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,080
What about you?

123
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,850
How was the big sales presentation?

124
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,630
A disaster!

125
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,940
Jerry was completely unprepared, as usual.

126
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,120
It was almost funny, but mostly embarrassing.

127
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Yeah…

128
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,560
That’s not a surprise, I guess.

129
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,710
When I heard he was in charge, I was sure
it would go completely Pete Tong, like everything

130
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,810
he’s involved with.

131
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,500
What’s weird is that he seems to have no
idea how bad he is at his job.

132
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,060
Yeah.

133
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,500
What’s that called?

134
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,680
Dunning-Kruger or something?

135
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,300
He’s probably in the break room right now
telling everyone how he had an absolute blinder,

136
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,690
and how amazing he is.

137
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,690
Good point.

138
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,000
I’ll avoid the break room.

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,850
Anyway, I’ll let you get back to your work.

140
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,960
This time, we want you to do some work!

141
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,620
You’ll see sentences from the dialogue,
but with the slang phrases removed.

142
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,690
Can you remember them?

143
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:36,440
Let’s see the first one.

144
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,730
Do you remember the answer?

145
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,550
It was ‘cock up.’

146
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,440
What does this mean?

147
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,830
This means a mistake.

148
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,020
You can use it as a noun or a verb.

149
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,490
For example: ‘He made a massive cock up
with the hotel bookings.’

150
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,820
‘He really cocked up the hotel bookings.’

151
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:06,140
‘Cock up’ is not very rude, but it’s
not polite, either, so be careful where you

152
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,400
use it.

153
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,190
Let’s look at the second sentence.

154
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,420
What do you have here?

155
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,800
‘Hunky dory’ means ‘fine’ or ‘OK’.

156
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,070
For example, you might say: ‘I was feeling
pretty ill yesterday, but today everything’s

157
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,820
hunky dory.’

158
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,839
‘Hunky dory’ is often used with the word
‘everything’, as in ‘Everything was

159
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,420
hunky dory’ or ‘Is everything hunky dory
now?’

160
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,310
Here’s the third sentence.

161
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:44,100
Can you remember this one?

162
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,120
‘Pete Tong?’

163
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,160
What on earth does that mean!?

164
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,970
Pete Tong is a famous radio DJ, but that’s
not the point here.

165
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,970
This is an example of rhyming slang.

166
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,959
‘Tong’ rhymes with ‘wrong’; if you
say that something ‘went completely Pete

167
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,579
Tong’, you mean it went very badly.

168
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,110
OK, last one.

169
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,339
What goes in this sentence?

170
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,660
What did you get?

171
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:21,160
‘Blinder’ means an excellent performance,
usually in a sport event, but we can use it

172
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,269
in other situations.

173
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:26,000
You
usually use the verb ‘have’, but you can

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,950
also say ‘play a blinder’ if you’re
talking about sports.

175
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,110
For example, you could say ‘We had a blinder
at the trivia night.

176
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,100
We won by nearly 50 points!’

177
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,470
‘Holly played a blinder in the five-a-side
match yesterday.

178
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,100
She scored four goals!’

179
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,339
Let’s look at one more topic.

180
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:55,370
In this section, you will hear the same dialogue
twice.

181
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:00,839
In the second dialogue, we’ll replace four
words and phrases with slang with the same

182
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,709
meaning.

183
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,480
Watch the first dialogue now.

184
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,260
So, how’s everything?

185
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,180
Honestly?

186
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,100
Not great.

187
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,550
Oh no, why not?

188
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,730
It’s my new housemate.

189
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:17,529
He seemed perfectly normal when I met him,
but he’s been acting weird recently, and

190
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:18,899
getting on my nerves.

191
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:22,889
Last Sunday, I cooked a bunch of food to take
to work for lunch all week.

192
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,709
He ate *all* of it on Sunday night after I
went to bed.

193
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,120
I was really surprised!

194
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,499
*All* your food?

195
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:30,499
Everything.

196
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:34,350
It’s such a shame because I was so happy
when I finally found this place.

197
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,589
It seemed perfect: it’s a lovely area, and
it’s very cheap for what it is.

198
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:41,620
I’d be disappointed if I had to move out
and find somewhere else.

199
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,430
So, are you seriously thinking about moving
out again?

200
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,730
You just got there!

201
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,800
I don’t know.

202
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,420
I guess I have to, but I’m putting off making
a decision.

203
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,500
Partly, I just can’t face house hunting
again, you know?

204
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,341
It’s so much work, and when I get home these
days, I’m really tired and I don’t want

205
00:10:58,341 --> 00:10:59,839
to think about it.

206
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,120
Well if you need some help, just let me know
Did you understand that?

207
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,839
If not, it could be a good idea to go back
and listen again.

208
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,100
Next, watch the second dialogue.

209
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,600
Try to find the four slang words and phrases,
and write them down!

210
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,320
So, how's everything?

211
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,220
Honestly?

212
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,080
Not great.

213
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,699
Oh no, why not?

214
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:24,379
It’s my new housemate.

215
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:29,509
He seemed perfectly normal when I met him,
but he’s been acting weirdly recently, and

216
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:31,060
getting on my nerves.

217
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,579
Last Sunday, I cooked a bunch of food to take
to work for lunch all week.

218
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:39,420
He ate *all* of it on Sunday night after I
went to bed.

219
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,569
I was gobsmacked!

220
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:42,439
*All* your food?

221
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:43,439
Everything.

222
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:47,720
It’s such a shame because I was over the
moon when I finally found this place.

223
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,110
It seemed perfect: it’s a lovely area, and
it’s very cheap for what it is.

224
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,740
I’d be gutted if I had to move out and find
somewhere else.

225
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,790
So, are you seriously thinking about moving
out again?

226
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,250
You just got there!

227
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,790
I don’t know.

228
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,269
I guess I have to, but I’m putting off making
a decision.

229
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:08,700
Partly, I just can’t face house hunting
again, you know?

230
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,161
It’s so much work, and when I get home these
days, I’m zonked and I don’t want to think

231
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:14,240
about it.

232
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,730
Well if you need some help, just let me know
Did you find the four slang words and phrases?

233
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,399
Can you work out what they mean?

234
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,490
The first slang word was ‘gobsmacked’.

235
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,629
Do you remember what the original word was?

236
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:32,860
This means ‘really surprised’.

237
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,880
It has a strong meaning, so it’s used to
describe strong emotions.

238
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:45,120
For example ‘I was gobsmacked that Liverpool
beat Barcelona in the last minute!’

239
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,060
‘He was gobsmacked when he open his tax
bill!’

240
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,280
Next was ‘gutted.’

241
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,279
Do you remember what this replaced?

242
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,390
It replaced ‘disappointed’, and also describes
strong feelings.

243
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,870
For example, if you miss your best friend’s
wedding, or your holiday gets cancelled at

244
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:09,580
the last minute, you might feel gutted.

245
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,600
Next was ‘over the moon’, which means
‘very happy’.

246
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,260
For example, ‘I’m over the moon because
I just got a new job.’

247
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,100
Finally, ‘zonked’.

248
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,820
What a strange word!

249
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,740
What could ‘zonked’ mean?

250
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,529
It means the same as ‘very tired’ or ‘exhausted’.

251
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:35,540
For example ‘I was zonked when I got home
from work today.’

252
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,680
Oh, one more thing.

253
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,459
At the beginning, you used the words ‘knackered’
and ‘bog roll’.

254
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:44,899
What do those mean?

255
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:50,470
Well ‘knackered’ is another way of saying
‘very tired’, and ‘bog roll’ is toilet

256
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,720
paper!

257
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,819
Well, now we know.

258
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:55,600
Thanks for watching!

259
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,149
See you next time!
