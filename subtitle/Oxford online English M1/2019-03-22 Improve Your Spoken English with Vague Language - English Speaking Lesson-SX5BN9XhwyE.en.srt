00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,909
Hi, I’m Martin.

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:07,319
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:14,280
In this lesson, you can learn how to use vague
language in English.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,580
What’s vague language, and why do you need
it?

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,450
Here’s a question: do you ever feel like
you can’t find the right word to express

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,880
what you want to say?

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,680
We’ve got good news!

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,000
You don’t always need to find exactly the
right word.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,330
The word ‘vague’ means that something
is not clear or detailed.

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:46,740
In spoken, informal English, fluent speakers
often use vague language.

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,420
For example, if you ask me what I did yesterday,
and I reply, “Just some stuff at home,”

12
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,570
that is a vague answer.

13
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,739
I’m not giving you details.

14
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,570
Using vague language will make your English
sound more natural.

15
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,060
It will also make it easier to speak fluently,
because you can communicate without needing

16
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,720
to use precise vocabulary.

00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:34,340
But now, let’s look at how you can use vague
language when you speak.

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,980
So, what are your plans for tomorrow?

23
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,060
First, I’m going into the city centre.

24
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:47,119
I need to buy a shirt and some toothpaste,
then at 10.30 I’m meeting William Bukowski

25
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,920
for coffee at the café on Gloucester Square.

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,060
What about you?

27
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,150
I have to spend two hours working in the morning,
then I’m meeting six old friends.

28
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:02,840
We’re going to go for a drink, then to an
Italian restaurant where they serve 44 different

29
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,040
kinds of pizza.

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,180
Really?

31
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,700
I love Italian food.

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:15,940
I especially like caprese salad, spaghetti
vongole, pizza romana, ravioli, tiramisu,

33
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,400
panna cotta…

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,640
Did that sound like a natural conversation to you?

35
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,640
Hopefully it didn't.

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,640
Why do you think that is?

37
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,080
What made it sound slightly weird?

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,460
The problem was that there was too much detail.

39
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,999
If someone asks you an everyday question like
“What are your plans for tomorrow?”, you

40
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:42,889
don’t need to give *every* detail of your
plans.

41
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:46,379
This is where vague language can be useful.

42
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:51,680
Vague language lets you avoid unnecessary
detail, which allows you to express your ideas

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,580
more efficiently.

44
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,939
Let’s see another version of this conversation.

45
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:01,590
This time, we’ll use vague language to avoid
unnecessary detail.

46
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,959
So, what are your plans for tomorrow?

47
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,650
I’m going into the city centre to buy some
stuff, then I’m meeting a friend for a coffee.

48
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,650
You?

49
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,560
I have to do some work in the morning, then
I’m meeting a few old friends later.

50
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,909
We’re going for a drink, then to an Italian
restaurant where they have lots of different

51
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:20,019
kinds of pizza.

52
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:21,019
Really?

53
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:24,809
I love Italian food, especially the pasta.

54
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:28,430
I really like spaghetti vongole and things
like that.

55
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:37,380
Here’s a question: can you remember all
of the differences between the two dialogues?

56
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,320
Let’s look at some of the language you heard.

57
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:48,609
First, the words ‘thing’ and ‘stuff’
are useful.

58
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:55,890
In the dialogue, you heard ‘I’m going
into the city centre to buy some stuff’.

59
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:02,660
You can use thing or things to refer to an
object or objects.

60
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:08,060
For example: ‘Give me that thing to clean
the window.’

61
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,299
‘Don’t forget to take your things with
you.’

62
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,340
You can also use stuff in a similar way.

63
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,560
Remember that stuff is uncountable.

64
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,500
For example: ‘We’re only going for two
days, so we don’t need much stuff.’

65
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,120
‘Every time I move apartments, I throw loads
of stuff away.’

66
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,570
Both words, ‘thing’ and ‘stuff’, can
also be used to talk about things you have

67
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,910
to do.

68
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:44,200
For example: ‘I have to go to that thing
tonight.’

69
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,080
‘I have a lot of stuff to do next week.’

70
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,590
You can also use vague language when talking
about numbers.

71
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,560
When talking about numbers or quantities,
you can avoid unnecessary detail by using

72
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:05,700
expressions like lots of, loads of, a few,
a couple, and so on.

73
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:11,300
For example, instead of saying ‘They sent
me 34 emails yesterday.’

74
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,440
You can say ‘They sent me loads of emails
yesterday.’

75
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,980
Instead of saying ‘I saw six of my old school
friends last night.’

76
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,840
You can say ‘I saw a few of my old school
friends last night.’

77
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,640
And, instead of saying ‘I have to finish
three more things, and then we can go.’

78
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:38,740
You can say ‘I have to finish a couple more
things, and then we can go.’

79
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:45,340
In these cases, it’s more natural to avoid
giving the exact number unless the number

80
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,350
is somehow important.

81
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:55,970
Finally, another way to use vague language
is when shortening a list.

82
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:03,890
Imagine that your friend just came back from
vacation, and you ask, ‘What did you do?’

83
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:11,420
Your friend says ‘We went swimming in the
sea, sunbathed on the beach, read books, ate

84
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:18,180
in restaurants, took a surfing lesson, visited
different villages, slept a lot, went for

85
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,380
a bike ride and spent one day sightseeing
in the city.’

86
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,920
That doesn’t sound good, right?

87
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,760
It sounds quite robotic.

88
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:36,690
In informal speech, we usually shorten long
lists by using a phrase on the end like: ‘…and

89
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:44,110
that kind of thing’, ‘…and things like
that’, ‘…and so on’, ‘…or something

90
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,120
like that’.

91
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,780
So, your friend might say ‘We went to the
beach, did some sightseeing and things like

92
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,370
that.’

93
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,780
This is more natural.

94
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,120
It’s also more polite in a way.

95
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,000
When you say something like this, you’re
giving some details but not every detail.

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,960
This shows that you’re engaged in the conversation,
but it also shows that you understand that

97
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,560
the person you’re talking to probably doesn’t
want to hear every single detail.

98
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,830
Using vague language to avoid unnecessary
details is common, but vague language also

99
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:27,880
has other uses. Let's look.

100
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,710
How about going to the cinema tomorrow?

101
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,930
Could do.

102
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,930
What were you thinking?

103
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,920
We could see that documentary about climbing
in Yosemite.

104
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,510
It looks really interesting.

105
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,840
I’m not interested in seeing that.

106
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,580
I’d choose to watch something else, like
that Japanese horror film everyone’s talking

107
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,770
about.

108
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,710
I guess we could do that.

109
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,760
What time should we meet?

110
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,180
Come to my place at four o’clock, then we
can walk down together.

111
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,580
Alright.

112
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,710
Of course, in some situations, vagueness is
bad.

113
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:03,560
For example, if you have a contract or a legal
document, it shouldn’t be vague!

114
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,120
In general, we prefer to avoid vagueness in
writing.

115
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,740
However, in everyday speech, using vague,
indirect language can help you to sound more

116
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,260
polite.

117
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,180
In this dialogue, I was direct.

118
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:26,080
This might be fine if you’re talking to
someone you know well, but being so direct

119
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,960
could seem rude in another situation.

120
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,380
Let’s see how you could use vague language
to sound more polite in the same situation.

121
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,240
How about going to the cinema tomorrow?

122
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Could do.

123
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
What were you thinking?

124
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,300
We could see that documentary about climbing
in Yosemite.

125
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,849
It looks really interesting.

126
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,990
That’s not really my thing.

127
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,569
I’d kind of prefer to watch something else,
like that Japanese horror film everyone’s

128
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:51,600
talking about.

129
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,579
I guess we could do that.

130
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:55,279
What time should we meet?

131
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,940
You could come to my place around four o’clock,
then we can walk down together?

132
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,280
Alright.

133
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,339
What changed?

134
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:10,149
If you just look at the words, it’s almost
the same, but nonetheless the tone is quite

135
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,269
different.

136
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:15,129
Here, Marie was more indirect.

137
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:20,670
Instead of saying ‘I’m not interested
in seeing that’, she said ‘That’s not

138
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:25,949
really my thing’
Instead of saying ‘I’d choose to watch

139
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:32,829
something else’, I said ‘I’d kind of
prefer to watch something else’.

140
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:38,889
Instead of saying ‘Come to my place at four
o’clock’, she said ‘You could come to

141
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:43,100
my place around four o’clock’.

142
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,110
Let’s see what’s happening here.

143
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,569
Imagine that a friend comes to your home.

144
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:54,449
You notice your friend looks cold, so you
ask, ‘Shall I turn on the heater?’

145
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:57,360
Compare two answers: ‘Yes, please.

146
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,400
It’s cold in here.’

147
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,720
‘Yes, please.

148
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,140
It’s kind of cold in here.’

149
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,200
What’s the difference?

150
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:15,759
The first answer sounds very direct, which
could sound impolite.

151
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,329
It sounds a bit like a criticism.

152
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:24,720
By using the phrase ‘kind of’, you make
the second answer vaguer and therefore more

153
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,569
indirect.

154
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:32,720
You can use the phrases ‘kind of’ or ‘sort
of’ in this way.

155
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,600
For example: ‘Can I have some milk?

156
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,880
The food’s kind of spicy.’

157
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,140
Here’s another example: ‘I kind of just
want to stay in tonight.’

158
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,860
Saying ‘I want to stay in tonight’ sounds
direct.

159
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,940
Adding ‘kind of’ makes it sound softer.

160
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:58,240
You might also use this with times.

161
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,610
For example, you can use the words ‘about’
or ‘around’ when arranging to meet someone,

162
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,249
especially if it’s a casual meeting.

163
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:11,019
For example: ‘Let’s meet at four.’

164
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:14,390
This is more direct, which could sound like
an order.

165
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,139
‘Let’s meet at about four.’

166
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:23,240
This is more indirect, so it sounds more like
a suggestion.

167
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,540
Of course, you don’t always want to use
vague language.

168
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,629
If your friend needs to be here by ten o’clock
at the latest, then you shouldn’t say ‘Can

169
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:36,699
you get here around ten?’

170
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:43,709
But in other cases, using vague language will
make you sound more indirect, which often

171
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:49,529
sounds more polite.

172
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:50,800
Have you seen their apartment?

173
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
It’s amazing!

174
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Who do you mean?

175
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,249
Julia and her husband, … Ah, you know, whatsisname…

176
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,869
Can’t remember.

177
00:11:58,869 --> 00:12:00,649
Anyway, you know them, right?

178
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:01,649
Vaguely.

179
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:03,120
I haven’t been to their place.

180
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,379
It’s incredible.

181
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:07,910
It’s like something out of a sci-fi film.

182
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,699
They have that thing, you know…

183
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:11,209
I don’t know.

184
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:14,730
That whatchamacallit, I’ve never seen one
before.

185
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,619
I have no idea what you’re talking about.

186
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:17,619
Ah…

187
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:18,819
It has some weird name…

188
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:21,009
It’ll come to me in a minute.

189
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:26,679
Often, English learners speak about ‘native
speakers’ as if native English speakers

190
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,820
are all-knowing, but that isn’t the case.

191
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:37,559
No native speaker knows every word in English;
people also forget words all the time.

192
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,569
So what can you do if you can’t remember
the word for something?

193
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:44,000
Vague language can be your friend!

194
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,780
Take a look:
‘What does this thingy do?’

195
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:55,420
‘You can use this little whatsit to take
the back off your phone.’

196
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,130
‘I found a little metal thingamajig in my
desk drawer.

197
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,480
No idea where it came from.’

198
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,940
Words like ‘thingy’, ‘whatsit’ or
‘thingamajig’ are not normally used in

199
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,750
written English.

200
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:17,470
You can use them when you’re speaking if
you don’t know what something is called.

201
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:23,129
You can also do this with people if you’ve
forgotten someone’s name.

202
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:30,680
For example: ‘I’ve got a meeting with
whatsisface from the ad company tomorrow.’

203
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:36,740
‘He’s moving in with whatsername—that
girl he met at his friend’s wedding.’

204
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,939
'Whatsisface’ is a word made from the question
‘What is his face,’ which makes no sense,

205
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:45,699
and it’s not really clear where it comes
from.

206
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:50,999
‘Whatsername’ is easier to understand:
it’s made from the question ‘What is her

207
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:53,379
name?’

208
00:13:53,379 --> 00:14:00,610
You can change the words to talk about men
or women: ‘whatsisface’ or ‘whatserface’

209
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,119
‘Whatsisname’ or ‘whatsername’.

210
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:08,300
Again, these words cannot be used in written
English!

211
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:14,619
They’re also informal, so you shouldn’t
use them unless you know the person you’re

212
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:17,050
talking to well.

213
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,310
You should also never use these words directly
to someone’s face.

214
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,069
You can’t say: ‘Hey, whatsisface!

215
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:28,759
Good to see you, but I’ve forgotten your
name.’

216
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:31,550
This does not sound good!

217
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,790
Could vague language be helpful for you when
you’re speaking English?

218
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,709
How do you think it could help?

219
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:43,189
Please share your ideas in the comments—can
you think of anything we haven’t mentioned

220
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:45,619
in this video?

221
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:47,259
Thanks for watching!

222
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:48,029
See you next time!
