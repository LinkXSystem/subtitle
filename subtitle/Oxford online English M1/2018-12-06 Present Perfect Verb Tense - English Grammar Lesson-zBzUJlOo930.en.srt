00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,680
Hi, I’m Maria.

2
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:05,210
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,190
In this lesson, you can learn about the present
perfect verb tense in English.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,559
Hey Daniel, how long have you been a teacher?

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,170
I’ve been a teacher for four years now.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,550
Have you taught many lessons on the present
perfect?

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,550
Of course!

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,920
I’ve taught hundreds!

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,620
How many have you taught this week?

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,210
I haven’t taught any this week yet.

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,550
This is the first one!

12
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,540
Does your language have anything like the
present perfect?

13
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,940
Many languages don’t have a similar verb
form.

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,530
This can make it more difficult to use the
present perfect correctly in English.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,699
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use
the present perfect verb form in different

16
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:46,699
ways.

17
00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:50,640
Let’s start with two basic but important
points.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,179
Try to keep these in mind as you watch!

19
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:58,190
First, the present perfect connects the past
and the present.

20
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,400
Secondly, think about the name, ‘present
perfect’.

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,900
It’s a present verb form.

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,860
It tells you something about now.

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,610
Even though you often use the present perfect
to talk about things in the past, it’s still

24
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:19,340
a present form; it gives you some information
about the present.

25
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:27,280
Let’s start by looking at how to form the
present perfect tense.

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,900
The present perfect is formed with have or
has plus a past participle.

27
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,110
Have and has are often contracted.

28
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,110
For example:

29
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,900
I’ve finished everything.

30
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,860
She’s just left.

31
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,200
We’ve been here for hours.

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,340
Past participles usually look the same as
the past tense.

33
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,600
For example:

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,800
finish – finished – finished
leave – left – left

35
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,580
However, many common verbs are irregular.

36
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,190
That means you need to know irregular verbs
to use the present perfect.

37
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:11,300
There’s also a continuous form of the present
perfect, with been plus a verb with -ing.

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,540
For example:

39
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,640
I’ve been cleaning the house all morning.

40
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,720
He’s been acting very strangely lately.

41
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,890
However, in this lesson, we’re going to
focus on the simple verb form.

42
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,460
Make negatives by adding not after have or
has.

43
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,730
Again, this form is often contracted.

44
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,090
For example:

45
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,600
I haven’t seen anything like that before.

46
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,020
He hasn’t helped at all.

47
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,319
They haven’t given me much information.

48
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,340
Make questions by moving have or has before
the subject:

49
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,540
Have you booked the tickets yet?

50
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,400
How long has your sister been a vet?

51
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,020
How many people have you told about this?

52
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:03,990
Next, let’s look at how to actually use
the present perfect, and what it means.

53
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,890
Have you ever been to Argentina?

54
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,730
No, I’ve never even been to South America,
but I’d love to go!

55
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,920
Have you ever been skydiving?

56
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,099
Yeah, actually.

57
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,870
It was amazing!

58
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,730
Have you tried kangaroo before?

59
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,110
No, never.

60
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,180
What’s it like?

61
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,010
How many times have you seen this film?

62
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,170
More than once.

63
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,160
So, twice?

64
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,920
Three times?

65
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,160
Ok, ok, I’ve seen it eight times.

66
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,440
Eight?

67
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,960
You can use the present perfect to talk about
life experiences.

68
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,690
You just heard different examples of this.

69
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,560
Do you remember the questions we asked?

70
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,310
This is common with questions like:

71
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,960
Have you ever…?

72
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,130
Have you … before?

73
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,190
How many times have you…?

74
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,590
For example:

75
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,980
Have you ever seen a ghost?

76
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,400
Have you met Amit before?

77
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,540
How many times have you bought something and
never worn it?

78
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,150
In all these questions, you don’t say when.

79
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,020
You don’t use a time reference like ‘this
year’ or ‘recently’.

80
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,850
That’s because all these questions are asking
about your whole life.

81
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,630
You don’t say it, but the meaning is there.

82
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,320
Try something now: pause the video and write
down three questions.

83
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,640
Use your own ideas.

84
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,730
Then, write your own answers!

85
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,260
Pause the video and do it now.

86
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:40,780
Now, let’s look at another way to use the
present perfect.

87
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,760
Have you called about the Internet yet?

88
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,240
I haven’t, I’m sorry.

89
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,880
I’ve been so busy all day.

90
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,650
You said you’d do it today!

91
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,500
I haven’t been able to do any work since
Monday!

92
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,720
I’ve tried to call several times this week,
but they always say that they can only talk

93
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,940
to the account holder.

94
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,940
That’s you!

95
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,420
I know, I’m sorry.

96
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,360
I just haven’t had time all week.

97
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,460
So, what can I help you with?

98
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,270
Well, I haven’t been feeling well recently.

99
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,270
What are your symptoms?

100
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,740
I’ve had a really bad cough for a couple
of weeks now.

101
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,790
This week, I’ve started to feel really slow
and tired, and I haven’t had much appetite.

102
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,199
Have you had any nausea?

103
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,199
Headaches?

104
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,240
No, not really.

105
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,530
We’ll do some tests and see what we can
do.

106
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,460
You can use the present perfect to talk about
a time period which is unfinished.

107
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,820
Remember that the present perfect connects
the present and the past.

108
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,800
For example, take today.

109
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,120
Today is an unfinished time period.

110
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,970
It’s started, but it hasn’t finished yet.

111
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,500
You heard several other unfinished time periods
in the dialogues.

112
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,560
Can you remember any?

113
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,680
Here are some examples:
I’ve been so busy all day.

114
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,560
I haven’t been able to do any work since
Monday!

115
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,400
I haven’t been feeling well recently.

116
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:15,320
This week, I’ve started to feel really slow
and tired.

117
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,340
Other unfinished time periods include things
like this week, this month, this year, and

118
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,340
so on.

119
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:29,560
So, if you’re talking about an unfinished
time period, you can use the present perfect.

120
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,890
To make this clearer, compare unfinished time
with finished time:

121
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,370
I’ve been so busy all day.

122
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,310
I was so busy yesterday.

123
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,110
I haven’t been able to do any work since
Monday!

124
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,820
I wasn’t able to do any work last week.

125
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,960
I haven’t felt well recently.

126
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,300
I didn’t feel well last weekend.

127
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,300
I’ve had a really bad cough for a couple
of weeks now.

128
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,729
I had a really bad cough last year.

129
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:12,009
When you talk about a finished time period,
like last year or yesterday, you need to use

130
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,500
the past simple.

131
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:19,250
You can’t use the present perfect to talk
about finished time periods.

132
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:25,669
Sometimes, you can choose to use the present
perfect or the past simple with an unfinished

133
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:26,890
time period.

134
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,890
For example:

135
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,500
I’ve worked hard today.

136
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,320
I worked hard today.

137
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,530
These are both possible, but there’s a small
difference in meaning.

138
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,690
Do you know what?

139
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:46,180
The first sentence, with the present perfect,
suggests that today is not finished yet.

140
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,710
Maybe you have more work to do!

141
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:55,190
The second sentence, with the past simple,
suggests that today is finished.

142
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,580
It’s the evening and you’re relaxing after
a long day!

143
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,280
Let’s practice.

144
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,810
Look at three incomplete sentences:

145
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,300
I haven’t … today.

146
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,039
I’ve … a lot this week.

147
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:15,210
I haven’t … enough recently.

148
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,800
Can you complete the sentences to make them
true about you?

149
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,440
For example, you could say something like:

150
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,840
I haven’t eaten any fruit today.

151
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,910
I haven’t watched TV today.

152
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,990
I haven’t had a shower today.

153
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,880
Pause the video and write down three sentences.

154
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,760
Ok?

155
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,260
How was that?

156
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:46,290
Let’s look at one more way to use the present
perfect tense.

157
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,430
How long have you lived here?

158
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,830
For about a year.

159
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,370
Have you two known each other long?

160
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,730
Yeah, since we were at primary school!

161
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,870
How long have they been married?

162
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,870
I’m not sure.

163
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,100
I think for a couple of years?

164
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,860
Maybe not even that long.

165
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,220
Nice jacket!

166
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,750
Is it new?

167
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,870
This? No, I’ve had it for years!

168
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:13,360
You can use the present perfect to talk about
something which started in the past and is

169
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,990
still true now.

170
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,240
For example:

171
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,690
How long have you lived here?

172
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,820
This means that you still live here now.

173
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,660
Have you two known each other long?

174
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,380
You still know each other now.

175
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,970
How long have they been married?

176
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,149
They’re still married now.

177
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:35,510
I’ve had this jacket for years.

178
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,880
I still have it now.

179
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,720
Be careful: there’s a common mistake which
English learners make here.

180
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,270
It looks like this:

181
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,110
I’ve bought this jacket for three years.

182
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,660
Can you explain why this is wrong?

183
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:56,460
It’s wrong because the action of buying
the jacket is finished, and in the past.

184
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,470
You could say:

185
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,080
I bought this jacket three years ago.

186
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,830
The action of having the jacket is not finished.

187
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:11,580
It started in the past, when you bought it,
and it’s still true now, because you still

188
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,910
have the jacket now.

189
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,380
Again, it’s useful to compare the present
perfect and the past simple:

190
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,500
I’ve lived here for about a year.

191
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,970
I still live here now.

192
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,230
I lived there for about a year.

193
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,760
I don’t live there now.

194
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,670
How long have they been married?

195
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,810
They’re still married now.

196
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,480
How long were they married?

197
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,920
They’re not married now.

198
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,360
Okay, your turn to practice!

199
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,000
Look at three incomplete sentences:

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,030
I’ve had … for …
I’ve lived in … since …

201
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,570
I’ve been …

202
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:58,250
Your job is to complete these sentences so
that they’re true for you.

203
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,510
Pause the video, think about what you could
say, and write down three sentences.

204
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:07,830
If you aren’t sure, review this section
and use the examples you’ve seen to help

205
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,280
you.

206
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,769
How was that?

207
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:14,170
Hopefully easy!

208
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:20,660
Let’s look at one more way you can use the
present perfect tense.

209
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,520
What’s wrong with you?

210
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,660
Eurrgh.

211
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,400
I’ve eaten too many cakes and now I feel
terrible.

212
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,630
How many did you have?

213
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,300
I had six or seven.

214
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,540
That was smart.

215
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,080
But they were so tasty…

216
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
Have you lost something?

217
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,170
Yeah, I’ve lost my phone.

218
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,220
I put it down somewhere and now I can’t
find it.

219
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,740
When did you last use it?

220
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,740
I don’t know.

221
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,480
I had it last night, for sure.

222
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,610
Can you call me?

223
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,959
Oh no!

224
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:50,220
The cat’s been sick on the couch!

225
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,220
Again?

226
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,100
That’s the third time this week.

227
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,270
Can you clean it up?

228
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,550
I cleaned it last time!

229
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,230
You can use the present perfect to talk about
things in the past if there’s still a result

230
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,040
in the present.

231
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,079
For example:

232
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:11,480
I’ve eaten too many cakes and now I feel
terrible.

233
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,510
I ate the cakes in the past, but the result—feeling
terrible—is still true now.

234
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,480
I’ve lost my phone.

235
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,260
I lost my phone sometime in the past, but
the result—I can’t find my phone—is

236
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,200
still true now.

237
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,190
The cat’s been sick on the couch!

238
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:36,220
The cat was sick on the couch in the past,
but the result—the sofa needs cleaning—is

239
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,310
still true now.

240
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:43,590
You can also see something useful in these
dialogues: often, you start a conversation

241
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:48,850
using the present perfect, and then switch
to the past simple.

242
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,120
For example:
I’ve eaten too many cakes.

243
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,710
How many did you have?

244
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,330
I’ve lost my phone.

245
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,440
When did you last use it?

246
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,600
This is a very common pattern in English conversations.

247
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,160
Again, let’s compare the present perfect
to the past simple:

248
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,340
I’ve lost my phone.

249
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,370
I can’t find it now.

250
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,570
I lost my phone.

251
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,269
Maybe I found it again, or maybe I gave
up and had to get a new phone.

252
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:27,200
This sentence only tells you about the past,
so you can’t be sure what happened.

253
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,670
The cat’s been sick on the couch!

254
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,269
The couch needs cleaning, and maybe the
cat needs to go to the vet.

255
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,790
The cat was sick on the couch.

256
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,780
It’s safe to sit on the couch again.

257
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:45,040
Now, you know the most common ways to use
the present perfect tense in English.

258
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,920
We have a question for you: can you name all
the other verb tenses in English?

259
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,270
Which one do you find the most difficult to
understand?

260
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,990
