00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:06,710
Hello, I’m Gina and welcome to Oxford Online
English!

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,910
Tomorrow, you have a meeting to attend.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,440
If the meeting is in English, will you be
ready?

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,199
This lesson will help you learn useful phrases
to introduce yourself, respond to suggestions

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:30,439
and ideas, and ask questions in a business
meeting.

6
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:36,830
I want you to imagine you’re in the meeting,
and the chair has asked everyone to introduce

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,130
themselves.

8
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:45,700
What are some phrases you can use?

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,320
Sometimes, you’ll be in a meeting with people
you don’t know.

10
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:58,190
Other times, the chair will ask for quick
introductions to break the ice.

11
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,830
There are three things you should do here:

12
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,680
- Say your name
- Say your job title

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,970
- Describe your responsibilities

14
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:19,080
To say your name, you can use a formal, ‘My
name is _____’ or, if the meeting is more

15
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:26,200
informal, you can say, ‘Hi, I’m_____’.

16
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,640
For your position title, use ‘to be’,
just like for your name.

17
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:39,750
Then, decide if your position is the only
one in the company, or if there are others

18
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,390
who have the same job title.

19
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:49,260
For example, if you are the only secretary,
use ‘the’:

20
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,670
I’m the secretary.

21
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,800
If other people also have this position in
the company, use ‘a’:

22
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,020
I’m a project manager.

23
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,450
If necessary, you can say which department
you work in.

24
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:17,420
You can use the preposition ‘in’ plus
the noun: ‘engineering’, ‘marketing’,

25
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,560
‘finance’, etc.

26
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
For example:

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,210
I’m in the engineering department.

28
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:30,440
Or: I work in the marketing department.

29
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:37,950
Finally, you can briefly describe your responsibilities,
like this:

30
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,040
I manage each project from start to finish.

31
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,459
I’m responsible for web analytics and testing.

32
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:54,960
Or: I handle purchasing and our negotiations
with suppliers.

33
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:05,980
You can see that using verbs and phrases like
manage, be responsible for or handle can be

34
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,450
useful here.

35
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:15,620
Here is an example of a full introduction
in a formal meeting with people you don’t

36
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,080
know, or don’t know well:

37
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,740
My name is Gina Mares and I’m the marketing
manager here.

38
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:33,340
I handle online advertising and web analytics.

39
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,860
Here’s an example of a more informal introduction:

40
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,740
Hi, I’m Gina.

41
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,099
I’m in the sales department.

42
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,400
I manage our sales team.

43
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,300
How would you introduce yourself in a meeting?

44
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,450
You can give it a try now.

45
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:01,770
Now that you’ve introduced yourself, the
meeting will begin.

46
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:07,390
During the meeting, you might need to give
your opinion on the different agenda items

47
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,880
which you are discussing.

48
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:16,350
You might also need to react to other people’s
suggestions.

49
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:22,449
How can you do this?

50
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:27,240
When making suggestions, modal verbs can be
very useful.

51
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,990
‘Should’ ,‘ought to’ or ‘might want
to’ can express something you think is a

52
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,949
good idea, but not an obligation:

53
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:43,979
We ought to give new clients a gift from the
company.

54
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:49,900
We might want to consider looking for another
engineer to help with this.

55
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:58,220
Or: I think we should make this a priority
for this month.

56
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:05,860
‘Have to’ and ‘need to’ can express
something that is an obligation:

57
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,110
We have to improve the way we collect and
record sales data.

58
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:18,740
Or: We need to find a cheaper solution—our
budget is very tight.

59
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:26,240
Remember, you can also use these to make negative
suggestions:

60
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,360
We shouldn’t rush this—we need to think
it through carefully.

61
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,660
Or: We don’t need to hire new staff at the
moment.

62
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,200
Now, it’s your turn.

63
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:49,600
Choose a phrase and make a suggestion for
something in your own company.

64
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:57,319
Next, what can you do if you want to respond
to another suggestion?

65
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:04,680
Well, if you think it’s a good suggestion,
you can show you agree with phrases like:

66
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,880
I agree with _______.

67
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,940
That sounds good.

68
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,999
Or: Let’s go with this idea.

69
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:23,069
Here, go with means you agree with this idea
and think you should put it into action.

70
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:29,099
However, what if there is a suggestion you
don’t agree with?

71
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:34,669
Here are some good, professional ways to disagree:

72
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,980
To be honest, I’m not sure about this idea.

73
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,860
Good suggestion, but I can see a few problems…

74
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:49,440
Or: I see your point, however…

75
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,139
After a phrase like this, explain your point
of view.

76
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:55,520
For example:

77
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:02,220
I see your point, however, I don’t think
advertising in a magazine is a good idea.

78
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,200
People don’t read them as often these days.

79
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,879
Or: To be honest, I’m not sure about this
idea.

80
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:17,849
I think improving our website UI is a higher
priority right now.

81
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,480
OK?

82
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,379
Now, take the suggestion which you made earlier.

83
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:34,779
Pause the video and write down two sentences:
one to agree, and one to disagree.

84
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,560
Use the language you just learned.

85
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:48,360
Now, let’s move on to different ways to
ask a question in a meeting.

86
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:55,939
As an attendee, it’s important to make sure
you understand the content in the meeting.

87
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:02,759
Sometimes, the chair will ask everyone to
save questions until the end.

88
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,199
If you’re in a meeting where you can ask
questions at any time, there are a few good

89
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,460
phrases you can use.

90
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:19,240
For more formal meetings, you can begin with
a phrase like ‘sorry’, or ‘excuse me’

91
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,819
to politely bring the attention to you.

92
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:26,789
Then, you can use phrases like:

93
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:29,199
I have a question.

94
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,820
Why is…?

95
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,200
How…?

96
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,400
Or: Does this mean…?

97
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,250
For example:

98
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,980
Excuse me, how will the new requirements affect
the project deadline?

99
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,490
Or: Sorry to interrupt, but I have a question.

100
00:08:52,490 --> 00:09:00,690
Does this mean that the new IT systems won’t
be in place this year?

101
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:06,090
If there is something in the meeting that
you don’t understand, you can use phrases

102
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,640
to ask for clarification:

103
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,190
I didn’t understand…

104
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,480
Can you elaborate on…?

105
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,700
Or: Can you clarify…?

106
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:29,120
When using these phrases, it’s important
to explain exactly what you don’t know or

107
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,040
ask for clarity on something specific that
they said.

108
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:42,950
Again, you can use ‘excuse me’ and ‘sorry’
in more formal meetings to begin.

109
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,720
For example:

110
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,150
Sorry, can you clarify the third step in your
proposal?

111
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,900
I didn’t get the main idea.

112
00:09:52,900 --> 00:10:00,630
Or: Excuse me, but could you elaborate on
how this will fit with our existing marketing

113
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,060
campaigns?

114
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,900
Now, it’s your turn.

115
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:13,690
Practice asking a question or asking for clarification
about something.

116
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:20,710
It can be from a recent meeting or something
from your job in general.

117
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:29,240
Again, you can pause the video and write down
your ideas, for extra practice.

118
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:37,620
OK, now you can make suggestions and respond
to what other say in the meeting.

119
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,910
You can also ask questions if there is something
you don’t understand.

120
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:49,360
Next, imagine that you’ve discussed the
agenda items and come to an agreement on the

121
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,890
important decisions you needed to make.

122
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:59,470
You might need to show what you’re going
to do about these decisions after the meeting

123
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,280
has finished.

124
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,620
Here, you can offer to do something using
a few different phrases.

125
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:18,870
For something that you decide to do at that
moment for the future, you can use ‘will’.

126
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,100
For example:

127
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,480
I’ll call the client tomorrow.

128
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,320
Or: I’ll discuss this with the rest of my
team and get back to you by the end of the

129
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,820
week.

130
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:40,160
If you had a plan even before the meeting
began, you can use ‘going to’ or ‘planning

131
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,300
to’:

132
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,420
I’m going to get a team together for this
project.

133
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:54,900
Or: I’m planning to do one more round of
testing, and then we can go live.

134
00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:02,790
If you want to make an offer, you can use
‘can’, could or shall:

135
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,720
I can contact the supplier next week if we
need to.

136
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,480
I could put together a report if you think
it would help.

137
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:19,760
Or: Shall I talk to our engineering team and
get a cost estimate?

138
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:26,180
On the other hand, what if you are asked to
do something that you cannot do?

139
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,180
Well, there are some useful, polite phrases
you can use:

140
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,000
I’m afraid I can’t…

141
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,460
I’m sorry, but I don’t think I can…

142
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:47,800
Unfortunately, I won’t be able to…

143
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,160
Think about this.

144
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,560
What if someone asked you to move your project
deadline forward, but it wasn’t possible?

145
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,700
You could say:

146
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:05,440
Unfortunately, we won’t be able to complete
the project any sooner because we don’t

147
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,020
have the supplies yet.

148
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,680
Or: I’m sorry, but I don’t think we can
finish by the end of this month.

149
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,860
We need at least another six weeks.

150
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:26,370
At this point the meeting is wrapping up and
hopefully you have been able to make good

151
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:34,420
suggestions and offers and take part in
discussions effectively.

152
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,980
Will you be attending a meeting in English
soon?

153
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,720
Hopefully some of these phrases will be useful
for you!

154
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,550
That’s all for this lesson.

155
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,370
Hope you enjoyed and thank you for watching!
