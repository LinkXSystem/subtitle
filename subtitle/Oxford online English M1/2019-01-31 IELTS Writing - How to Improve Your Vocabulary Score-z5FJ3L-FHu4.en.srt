00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,440
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,730
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,020
In this lesson, you can learn how to improve
your vocabulary score in IELTS writing.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,950
Do you need an IELTS score of seven or higher?

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,980
Many people find it difficult to get scores
above band six or 6.5.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,669
Often, this is because people have bad habits
or they don’t clearly understand how the

7
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:27,099
IELTS exam works.

8
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:32,700

11
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,530
In this lesson, you’ll see some common mistakes
which IELTS students make which can hurt your

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,780
vocabulary score.

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,679
You’ll also see how you can change your
approach to the IELTS writing exam to get

14
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,769
a better score for vocabulary.

15
00:00:55,769 --> 00:01:01,030
Before we start, I really, really recommend
you read the official IELTS score scheme from

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,930
the British Council, and see what it says
about vocabulary.

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,310
There’s a link underneath the video.

18
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:13,020
There’s a lot of confusion and bad advice
about IELTS, but actually, the score scheme

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,700
is quite simple.

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,140
Let's start with the most important point.

21
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:25,300
There’s one really big mistake which many
IELTS students make with vocabulary: they

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,430
put words before ideas.

23
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:34,020
There are many videos and websites which promise
to teach you “100 essential IELTS words”,

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,990
or “300 words for band 8”, or whatever.

25
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:44,810
So, maybe you watch these videos, and you read
these vocabulary lists, and you try to learn them.

26
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,100
Then, you use the words and phrases in your
IELTS writing.

27
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,560
Sounds normal, right?

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,530
What’s the problem?

29
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,460
The problem is that natural communication
doesn’t work like that.

30
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,540
You don’t learn a word and think, “I’m
going to use this word in this conversation.”

31
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,380
IELTS is a test of your communication skills
in English.

32
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:11,980
Of course, you need a good vocabulary to communicate, but communication depends primarily

33
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,320
on ideas, not words.

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,540
Words express your ideas.

35
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,100
Using a word or a phrase without an idea behind
it is empty; it’s meaningless.

36
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,100
So, what can you do here?

37
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,459
First, spend more time thinking and planning
before you write, even in the exam.

38
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:36,290
Yes, I know you’re under a lot of time pressure,
but you need this.

39
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,420
If you don’t have a clear idea in your head,
you can’t write a clear answer.

40
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:47,840
Secondly, instead of learning lists of vocabulary
that you might not need, just learn the words,

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,140
phrases and collocations you need to express
your ideas.

42
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,620
Practice writing regularly, and learn vocabulary
by learning the words and phrases you need

43
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:59,450
when you need them.

44
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,180
However, this isn’t a practical point; it’s
about how you think.

45
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,349
If you think words come before ideas, you’ll
struggle with IELTS writing, especially task

46
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:10,349
two.

47
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:16,240
You need to put ideas first, words second.

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,180
In my experience, IELTS students are terrified
of repeating the same words and phrases in

49
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,190
their writing.

50
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,349
I made some videos where I wrote sample IELTS
answers, and a lot of comments said things

51
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:30,840
like, “You used the same word three times!

52
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,680
You suck!

53
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,800
We hate you!”

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,280
Okay, maybe they didn’t exactly say that;
I’m paraphrasing.

55
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,680
So, I’m going to be repetitive here. I'm going to say
something I’ve said many, many times before:

56
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,210
read the scoring scheme.

57
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,730
Go do it right now.

58
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,680
Read the descriptors for band seven.

59
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,480
What’s the first point?

60
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,820
You need to use vocabulary ‘with flexibility
and precision’.

61
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,680
Think about that word: ‘precision’.

62
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,129
That means you use the right word in the right
place to express your idea.

63
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,239
Here’s what a lot of students do when they
write:

64
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,120
One: they think, “Argh!

65
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,400
I can’t use the same word twice, or I’ll
get a lower score!”

66
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,350
Two: they try to find a ‘synonym’.

67
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,790
This is a problem, because there are very
few true synonyms in English.

68
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,550
Many words which you might think are synonyms
are not exactly the same.

69
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:34,000
Three: they use a word which is close to the
right meaning, but not exactly right.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,840
Four: they get band six for vocabulary because
they aren’t using vocabulary with precision.

71
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,060
I see this all the time when teaching IELTS
writing.

72
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,200
So, what should you do?

73
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,560
First, read the score scheme again.

74
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,010
It doesn’t even mention repetition in the
vocabulary band descriptions, except for band

75
00:04:54,010 --> 00:05:01,620
four, and I guarantee that 99.9% of you watching
this video would not get band four for vocabulary.

76
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,480
Next, if there’s a key idea in the task,
accept that you might need to refer to it

77
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,200
several times.

78
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,700
For example, the essay I wrote in our other
video was about communication, and many people

79
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,720
said that I used the word ‘communication’
too many times.

80
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,730
But here’s the thing: there’s no other
word which has the same meaning as ‘communication’.

81
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:30,220
If you’re writing an essay about communication,
you’ll need to repeat the word.

82
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,910
The same is true for many other things.

83
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:38,620
If you’re writing an essay about air pollution,
you’ll need to use the words ‘air pollution’.

84
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,600
You can’t avoid that, and it’s not a problem.

85
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,660
Many students here would try to use a different
phrase.

86
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,930
For example, instead of ‘air pollution’,
they might say ‘smog’, ‘exhaust fumes’,

87
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,110
‘impurities in the atmosphere’, or something
like that.

88
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,680
But, none of these have the same meaning as
‘air pollution’.

89
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,380
If you change the word, very often, you’re
changing the meaning.

90
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,310
If you don’t realise this, then your words
won’t fit your ideas, and then you get band

91
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,040
six maximum for vocabulary.

92
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,551
To be clear, if you’re repeating words and
phrases a lot, then that is a problem, but

93
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:20,630
probably not a vocabulary problem.

94
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,340
It could be that your ideas are repetitive,
or your structure is disorganized,

95
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,940
or that you don't know how to use referencing

96
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,700
to avoid repetition.

97
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,970
However, these points affect your coherence
and cohesion score; they aren’t part of

98
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,490
your vocabulary score.

99
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,300
So, let’s review the most important points
from this section:

100
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,710
First, stop thinking about synonyms.

101
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:49,470
Choose the word or phrase which fits your
idea most precisely.

102
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:55,150
Second, accept that key words and phrases
will need to be repeated to some extent.

103
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:00,710
It’s not a problem to use the same phrase
more than once if it’s a central part of

104
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,200
the task.

105
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,600
Let’s look at our next point.

106
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,620
Here are some ideas we often see online, or
hear from our IELTS students:

107
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,940
“I need more academic vocabulary.”

108
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,000
“I need more advanced vocabulary.”

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,190
“I need more idiomatic vocabulary.”

110
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,870
This causes problems.

111
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,880
First, and I’ve said this so many times
that I’m boring myself, but it’s crucial

112
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,160
so I’ll say it again: read the scoring scheme.

113
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,560
Does it talk about ‘academic vocabulary’?

114
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
No.

115
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,880
Does it talk about ‘advanced vocabulary’?

116
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
No.

117
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,540
Why not?

118
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,630
Because those things don’t exist.

119
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:48,600
Serious linguists don’t talk about ‘advanced
vocabulary’, because it isn’t real.

120
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,200
Words are just words.

121
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,800
They have meanings, and you use them to express
your ideas.

122
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,840
That’s it.

123
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,620
One word is like another word.

124
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,760
It’s not complicated.

125
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,360
So, what’s the point here?

126
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:06,490
Many IELTS students use specific words or
phrases because they think that they’re

127
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:12,080
‘academic’ or ‘advanced’, and they
think that this will get a higher score.

128
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,531
However, if you do this, you’re putting
words before ideas, and that means you aren’t

129
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:22,990
using your vocabulary precisely, and that
means it's very difficult to get band seven.

130
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:28,160
You do need to use some less common vocabulary
to get band seven or higher, but you also

131
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,310
need to use it well.

132
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,820
Learning a word or phrase won’t help unless
you really understand how to use it.

133
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,240
You need to understand exactly what a word
or phrase means.

134
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,800
You need to know how to use collocations with
the vocabulary you learn.

135
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,510
For example, if you’re writing a task two
essay about diet, you’ll need to know several

136
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,490
collocations with the word ‘diet’.

137
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,070
You also need control of register.

138
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,740
To get a high score for vocabulary, you need
to write in a consistent, appropriate style.

139
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,380
In general, IELTS students focus too much
on learning new words and phrases, and not

140
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,820
enough on using the words and phrases they
know accurately.

141
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,860
We’ll talk about how you can work on this
in the last section, but before that, we have

142
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:21,080
one more important point to cover.

143
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,960
One of the biggest differences between band
six and band seven in the IELTS writing exam

144
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,240
is the quantity of errors you can make.

145
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,920
At band six, you can make quite a lot of mistakes,
so long as your meaning is clear.

146
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,210
For band seven, you can make ‘occasional
errors’.

147
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,760
For band eight, you can make ‘rare errors’.

148
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,250
This is one of the major points which keeps
IELTS students at band six.

149
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:51,110
So, let’s think: what counts as a vocabulary
error?

150
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,060
There are four possibilities:

151
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,620
1.

152
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,260
You use the wrong word or phrase.

153
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:57,960
2.

154
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,680
You use an incorrect collocation.

155
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,620
For example, if you’re writing a task two
essay about healthy eating and diet, and you

156
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,650
say, ‘take a diet’, that would be a collocation
error.

157
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:15,280
You can ‘follow a diet,’ ‘eat a healthy
diet’, ‘have a good diet’, and many

158
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,220
others, but ‘take a diet’ isn’t possible.

159
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,220
3.

160
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,920
You spell a word incorrectly.

161
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,830
4.

162
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,330
You form a word incorrectly.

163
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:34,200
For example, if you want to make a noun from
the word ‘overweight’ and you write ‘overweightness’,

164
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,560
that would be a word formation error.

165
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,290
There’s no noun from the word ‘overweight’,
by the way; you need to use a phrase with

166
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,840
a gerund, like ‘being overweight’.

167
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,520
So, how can you reduce the number of errors
you make?

168
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,140
Here, you probably need feedback from a professional
teacher.

169
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,680
If you make multiple mistakes, then you won’t
be aware of a lot of the mistakes you’re

170
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,900
making.

171
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,740
Write essays or task one answers and look
at the mistakes you make.

172
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:08,560
Sort your errors into these four types: choice
of words, collocation, spelling or word formation.

173
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,360
If you're making mistakes with one thing,

174
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,580
for example, with spelling, do some study to find out why you're making these

175
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,580
mistakes and try to correct them.

176
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,060
Then, review your errors using a flashcard
app like Anki.

177
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,350
This is a long process and you need patience;
it will take a lot of work to reduce your

178
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,350
errors.

179
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,370
However, if you want band seven or higher,
it’s necessary.

180
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,490
Make flashcard questions with your errors,
and put the correct word or phrase as the

181
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,490
answer.

182
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,580
For example:

183
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:46,700
Question: overweightness
Answer: being overweight

184
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:52,660
Even better, make flashcards with full sentences
from your writing, like this:

185
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:58,600
Question: Overweightness is a major risk factor
for many diseases, including cardiovascular

186
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,880
disease and stroke.

187
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,250
Answer: Being overweight is a major risk factor
for many diseases, including cardiovascular

188
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,980
disease and stroke.

189
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,420
Okay, now let’s put all of this together
and make a plan for you to improve your IELTS

190
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,160
writing vocabulary score.

191
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,880
Learning vocabulary for IELTS is just learning
vocabulary.

192
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,780
You need to do the same things you would do
to improve your English vocabulary generally.

193
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,940
That means:

194
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,870
One: read regularly and widely.

195
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:34,840
Read as much as you can, read things from
different topics, written by different people,

196
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,460
from different sources.

197
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,780
Two: learn vocabulary in phrases, collocations
and sentences.

198
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:46,480
Learning a word in context is always more
effective than trying to learn individual

199
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,780
words.

200
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,660
For the IELTS writing exam, you also need
to write regularly.

201
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,800
You need to write practice answers and, ideally,
get feedback from a professional teacher.

202
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,060
Finally, you need to track and review your
vocabulary errors, as we said in the last section.

203
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:09,080
There’s one important point about improving
your vocabulary we haven’t mentioned.

204
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,380
You need time.

205
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,020
You need lots of time.

206
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:17,290
The average learner cannot change these things
in a few weeks, and even in 2-3 months you

207
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,350
can’t make a big difference.

208
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,690
Don’t waste your time learning lists of
‘essential IELTS words’ or ‘advanced

209
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,440
IELTS vocabulary’.

210
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,980
You won’t get a higher score by using a
word or phrase that you memorised and don’t

211
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,760
know how to use.

212
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,820
If you’re around band 5.5 to 6.5 and you
need a score of seven or above, you need to

213
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,900
do these things consistently over a long period
of time to improve.

214
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,880
You need to read, write, get feedback and
review your errors, and you need to keep doing

215
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,960
these things for months and months and months.

216
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,160
That’s how you get better.

217
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,580
Anyway, good luck if you have an IELTS exam
coming up soon, and thanks for watching!
