00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,270
Hello, I'm Oli.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,549
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:11,530
In this pronunciation lesson, you can learn
about sounds and spelling in English.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:17,490
If you just look at a word in English, do
you know how to pronounce it?

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,490
Not always.

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:24,140
It can be difficult because, in English, the
way we write a word and the way we say it

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,400
are not always the same.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,260
In this lesson, you can learn more about the
differences between how we write a word and

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,800
how we say a word in English.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,640
Part one: the same letter can have different
sounds.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,120
Look at three words: phone, clock, for.

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,160
All of these words contain the letter O.

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,860
Is the letter O pronounced the same way in
each word?

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,430
No.

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,900
In "phone," the letter O has an /əʊ/ sound.

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,100
In "clock," O has an /ɒ/ sound.

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,330
In "for," O has an /ɔː/ sound.

18
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,580
So here, we have three different words, all
with the same letter, but with three different

19
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,740
pronunciations.

20
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,800
Part two: different letters can have the same
sound.

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,780
Let's look at three more words: big, England,
busy.

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:33,440
OK, some questions: what sound does the I
in "big" make?

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,210
What sound does the E in "England" make?

24
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,670
And what sound does the U in "busy" make?

25
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,680
Listen again: big, England, busy.

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,970
These three letters all have the same sound:
/ɪ/.

27
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:59,870
So here, we have three different letters,
I, E, and U, but they all make one sound,

28
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,960
/ɪ/.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,259
OK, at this point, it should be clear that
letters and sounds are not the same thing

30
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,429
in English.

31
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,130
So let's look at this in more detail.

32
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,350
Part three: how to count letters and sounds.

33
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,680
OK, look at three more words: fast, seven,
ted.

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,660
I want you to think about two questions: how
many letters do these words have, and how

35
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,200
many sounds do these words have?

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,430
OK, well, the first question is easy.

37
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,110
"Fast" has four letters.

38
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,700
"Seven" has five letters, and "red" has three
letters.

39
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,400
What about the second question?

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,410
How many sounds do the words have?

41
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:49,300
Well, actually, "fast" has four sounds.

42
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,060
/f/-/ɑː/-/s/-/t/.

43
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,940
"Seven" has five sounds: /s/-/e/-/v/-
-/n/.

44
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:03,900
"Red" has three sounds: /r/-/e/-/d/.

45
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,019
So all of these words have the same number
of letters and sounds.

46
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:11,410
"Fast" has four letters and four sounds.

47
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,550
"Seven" has five letters and five sounds.

48
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,320
"Red" has three letters and three sounds.

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:25,099
That makes these words easy to pronounce because
you see the word, one letter equals one sound.

50
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:26,660
It's easy.

51
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,810
But are all English words like this?

52
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,200
No, most English words are not like this.

53
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,260
This is what makes English pronunciation difficult.

54
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,140
So let's look at this again.

55
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,090
Part four: letters and sounds are not always
the same thing.

56
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:50,020
OK, listen to three more words: coffee, teacher,
shopping.

57
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:56,181
Think about the same questions we asked before:
how many letters does each word have, and

58
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:58,680
how many sounds does each word have?

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,350
So, "coffee" has six letters, but how many
sounds?

60
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,269
Just four.

61
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:12,959
The two Fs together make one /f/ sound, and
the two Es together make one /i/ sound.

62
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,459
So there are four sounds.

63
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,440
/k/-/ɒ/-/f/-/i/.

64
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,159
Teacher has seven letters.

65
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,739
How many sounds?

66
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:24,070
Four, again.

67
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,669
So the two letters EA make one /iː/ sound.

68
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:37,159
The two letters CH make one /tʃ/ sound, and
the two letters, ER, make one /ə/ sound.

69
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:42,259
So there are four sounds in the word: /t/-/iː/-/tʃ/-/ə/.

70
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:46,319
"Shopping" has eight letters.

71
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,490
How many sounds?

72
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,490
Five.

73
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,909
S and H together make one /ʃ/ sound.

74
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:58,089
The two Ps together make one /p/ sound.

75
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:02,580
The letters NG make one /ŋ/ sound.

76
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,899
So that leaves five sounds: /ʃ/-/ɒ/-/p/-/ɪ/-/ŋ/.

77
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:15,339
Often, a word has more letters than sounds
because two or more letters together can make

78
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:17,119
one sound.

79
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:20,879
Sometimes three or four letters together can
make one sound.

80
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,520
For example, look at the word "four," F-O-U-R.

81
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,840
In this word, the three letters, 'OUR', make
one sound: /ɔː/.

82
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,589
Let's look at three more words: one, use,
Europe.

83
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:39,619
Same questions: How many letters?

84
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:40,619
How many sounds?

85
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:43,479
Well, let's look at "one."

86
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:50,039
"One" has three letters and three sounds,
so that's easy, right?

87
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:55,340
But what are the three sounds?

88
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,020
/w/-/ʌ/-/n/.

89
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,770
Where does that /w/ sound come from?

90
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,289
What about the other words?

91
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:08,369
Well, "use" has three sounds, again, /j/-/ʊː/-/z/.

92
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:16,789
Again, you can see a /j/ sound, which is pronounced,
but which isn't obviously in the written word.

93
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:22,930
"Europe" has five sounds: /j/-/ʊə/-/r/-/ə/-/p/.

94
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,300
Once again, you can see there's a /j/ sound
in the pronunciation, which isn't written

95
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,419
clearly in the word.

96
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:37,060
So to review: very often, words have more
letters than sounds because, very often, two

97
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,889
or more letters together can produce one sound.

98
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:46,240
Sometimes there are extra sounds which are
not obviously written, but which are pronounced

99
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,599
when you say the word.

100
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:49,599
Okay.

101
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,979
Let's do some practice together.

102
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:58,969
I'm going to give you five words: apple, because,
student, cheap, Wednesday.

103
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:05,449
Think about the same questions: how many letters
do these words have, and how many sounds do

104
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:07,229
these words have?

105
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:11,370
If you want, pause the video and think about
your answer.

106
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,360
We can start again when you're ready and look
at the answers together.

107
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,909
OK, ready?

108
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:18,969
Let's check.

109
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:25,770
"Apple" has five letters and three sounds:
/æ/-/p/-/l/.

110
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:35,879
"Because" has seven letters and five sounds:
/b/-/ɪ/-/k/-/ɒ/-/z/.

111
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:42,439
"Student" has seven letters and eight sounds.

112
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:44,209
How's this possible?

113
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:48,840
Let's look: /s/-/t/-/j/-/ʊː/-/d/-/e/-/n/-/t/.

114
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,059
Eight.

115
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:59,290
There's an extra /j/ before the /ʊː/, which
again is not obvious from the spelling, but

116
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,379
it's in the pronunciation.

117
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:06,289
"Cheap" has five letters and three sounds.

118
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:08,029
/tʃ/-/iː/-/p/.

119
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:16,979
Wednesday, nine letters, six sounds: /w/-/e/-/n/-/z/-/d/-/eɪ/.

120
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,699
OK, that's the end of the lesson.

121
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,330

topic some more.

126
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,089
But that's all.

127
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:41,089
Thanks again for watching.

128
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:42,089
