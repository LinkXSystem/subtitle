00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:02,800
Hi, I’m Maria.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,970
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:11,800
In this lesson, you’ll see five common IELTS
preparation mistakes that we often see.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,820
Are you planning to take the IELTS exam?

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,400
At Oxford Online English, we meet and teach
many IELTS students.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,100
Often, these students find it difficult to
prepare for IELTS and get the score they want.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,510
It’s not because they don’t have the ability.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,470
It’s not because they don’t work hard.

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,950
So, why is it?

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,780
It’s because they make simple, avoidable
mistakes.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,739
The IELTS preparation mistakes you’ll see
in this video are very common; we see them

12
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,260
all the time!

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,889
Making these mistakes will make it more difficult
to get the IELTS score you need.

14
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:54,960
We’ll explain how you can avoid these common
mistakes and prepare for IELTS more effectively.

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,880
Ok, this might seem obvious.

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,839
It might seem boring.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,900
People leaving exam preparation too late?

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,300
What a surprise!

19
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,030
But, it’s the number one mistake that IELTS
students make.

20
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,350
The problem is that many students see IELTS
like exams you probably had at school: exams

21
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,600
which tested your knowledge of facts.

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,469
With that kind of exam, you could start revising
a few days before, memorise a load of information,

23
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:21,969
and maybe get a good mark.

24
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:25,040
We’ve all done that, I think, right?

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,720
I know I have!

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,660
But, here’s the problem:

27
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,159
IELTS isn’t an exam about facts.

28
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,360
It’s a test of your practical skills in
English.

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,619
Those skills take time to learn and develop.

30
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:45,899
You can’t spend a few days with your books
and magically get a higher IELTS score.

31
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,170
You’re probably thinking: so how long does
it take?

32
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,880
The answer is: longer than you think.

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,700
In our experience, moving your IELTS score
half a band—so from six to six point five,

34
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,340
for example—takes around two to three months
of study.

35
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,110
Moving up one full band takes around six months.

36
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,460
Remember that we’re talking about regular
study here: two or three hours of lessons

37
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,049
per week, plus several hours of study in your
own time.

38
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,200
Also, these are averages.

39
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,140
How long it takes you depends on your exact
situation, it depends on your strengths and

40
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,549
weaknesses, and it depends on what kind of
learner you are.

41
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:25,360
So, it’s possible that you could do it faster…

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,470
…but it might also take you longer.

43
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,350
If you need to take IELTS, probably it’s
important to you.

44
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,650
You’re applying to university, or you’re
planning to emigrate to an English-speaking

45
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,650
country.

46
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,050
So, don’t leave it too late!

47
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,670
Even if you just think that you might need
IELTS in the future, it’s a good idea to

48
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,090
get into good habits now.

49
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,920
Here are some suggestions:

50
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,950
One: start reading in English every day.

51
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,090
You don’t have to spend a lot of time: ten
to fifteen minutes is enough.

52
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,879
Try to read a variety of things.

53
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,659
Two: listen to something in English every
day.

54
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:11,769
Again, you don’t need to spend a lot of
time on this, but you should try to listen

55
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:16,099
to varied materials; don’t listen to the
same thing every day.

56
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:23,180
Three: if you need IELTS in the next 12 months,
find a teacher and ask for a speaking and

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,360
writing assessment.

58
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,640
This way, you’ll know where you are now,
and how much work you have to do.

59
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:39,500
Start preparing early, and it’ll be much
easier to get the IELTS score you need.

60
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,780
Often, people ask us questions like:

61
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,930
“Can you tell me some tricks to improve
my reading score?”

62
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,280
“What are some linking words I should use
in my essay?”

63
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,950
“How do I get a higher score in the listening
exam?”

64
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,510
All these questions are looking for a trick.

65
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,280
You think that there’s some secret to getting
a higher IELTS score, and if you could just

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,810
find someone to give you the secret, everything
would be okay.

67
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,220
Here’s the secret: ready?

68
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,080
The secret is… there’s no secret.

69
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,560
Seriously: the IELTS scoring systems are public.

70
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,720
You can read them, and we recommend that you
do!

71
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,280
Take the reading exam.

72
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,640
Many people ask how to improve their reading
score.

73
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,510
They want to know: what’s the trick?

74
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,960
What’s the secret?

75
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,890
Again, there’s no secret.

76
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,100
To get a high score in the IELTS reading exam,
you need to be good at reading.

77
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,000
The listening exam is the same.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,340
These are skills that take months or years
to develop.

79
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,100
People ask: what are some linking words I
should use in my essay?

80
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,120
They think that using more linking words equals
a higher score in the writing exam.

81
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,060
Here’s something which might surprise you:

82
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,610
We’ve seen hundreds of IELTS writing tasks.

83
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:59,610
We have never seen a task which got a lower
score because it didn’t use enough linking

84
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,940
words.

85
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:07,830
We have seen many tasks which got a lower
score because they overused linking words,

86
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,850
or used them incorrectly.

87
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,600
It’s the same with vocabulary.

88
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,580
We see students memorising sentences, idioms
and academic vocabulary because they think

89
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,030
that it will boost their score.

90
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:28,570
Again, if you do this, you’re likely
to hurt your score, because you’ll misuse

91
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,270
the vocabulary that you just memorised from
a list.

92
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,250
If you want to improve your IELTS writing
score, it’s not simple: you need to learn

93
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,870
to write more effectively, and that requires
a lot of time and work.

94
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,220
You can’t memorise some sentences or a template
and expect to get a high score—it won’t

95
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,300
work.

96
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,000
Although, there is one case where there might
be a kind of ‘trick’ to improve your score

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
fast.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,460
In the speaking and writing exams, if you
don’t understand how the exam and the scoring

99
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,660
system work, you might be making mistakes
with how you approach the tasks.

100
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:10,870
For example, if you don’t write in clear
paragraphs, that will have a big negative

101
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,750
effect on your score.

102
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,350
Correcting that problem—which is very easy
to do—can make a big difference.

103
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,080
If you think that in the speaking exam, giving
longer answers will always improve your score,

104
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,880
then that can have a negative effect, because
your answers also need to be relevant.

105
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,700
Longer answers can easily lose focus and go
off-topic.

106
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,240
Again, correcting this can make a big difference
quickly.

107
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,500
However, this isn’t really ‘improving’
your score; you’re just getting the score

108
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,480
your English should get.

109
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,940
This brings us to our third mistake:

110
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,660
How are IELTS scores decided, and what do

111
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,640
they mean?

112
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,680
Do you know?

113
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,970
As we said before, the IELTS scoring systems
are publicly available.

114
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,470
You should read them!

115
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,150
There are links for you below the video.

116
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,440
There are two mistakes which people make here.

117
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,010
First, don’t think of IELTS scores as numbers.

118
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,640
Your IELTS score looks like a number, but
it isn’t really.

119
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:19,400
It’s a very detailed description of what
you can or can’t do in English.

120
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,680
Why is this important?

121
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,530
Many students think about IELTS scores like
tests at school: “I got five.

122
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,220
I need seven, so I just need two more…

123
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,810
Maybe if I try again, I’ll get a better
score?”

124
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,970
Two more…

125
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,590
Two more what?

126
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,301
The difference between band five and band
seven is huge.

127
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:42,931
It’s the difference between speaking
basic English and speaking at a level that

128
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:47,040
is enough to study for a Master’s degree
or work in a high-level job.

129
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,640
IELTS scores aren’t numbers.

130
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,930
Secondly, by learning about the scoring system,
you can see what the examiners are looking

131
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,930
for.

132
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:02,260
This is very important, because you need to
do different things at different bands.

133
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,400
For example, is your target band six?

134
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,640
You need to focus on communicating clearly.

135
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,800
You don’t need to worry about making grammar
or vocabulary mistakes so much.

136
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,430
Are you aiming for band seven?

137
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,050
You need to speak and write without making
many language errors.

138
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,150
It’s very different to band six.

139
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,660
Do you need seven point five in the speaking
test?

140
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,269
That means you need two scores of seven and
two scores of eight.

141
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:34,419
Where can you get eight?

142
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:40,360
What do you need to improve to make sure you
get at least seven in every score?

143
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,180
You need to have answers to these questions
in order to prepare effectively.

144
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,970
Are you looking to improve your score in the
writing exam in a short time?

145
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:54,810
You should probably focus on the task achievement
and coherence/cohesion scores, which are easier

146
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,670
to change, especially if you don’t have
much time.

147
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,670
We could go on.

148
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:05,459
The point is: depending on your target, where
you are now, and how much time you have, you’ll

149
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,980
need to prepare differently.

150
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,340
Understanding the scoring system will help
you make an effective study plan and avoid

151
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,860
wasting time.

152
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,060
If you aren’t sure where to start, ask an
experienced IELTS teacher for advice.

153
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:24,589
Let’s move on to mistake number four.

154
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:30,360
Many IELTS students have been preparing for
IELTS or trying to get a certain score for

155
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,750
some time.

156
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:37,579
In our experience, these students often think
a lot about what they ‘should’ say.

157
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:40,139
What does the examiner want to hear?

158
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:43,449
Is this a good answer to this question?

159
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:47,959
If I include some interesting facts in my
essay introduction, will the examiner like

160
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,640
it more?

161
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,689
This causes a problem: you feel paralyzed,
because you feel like you can’t find ideas.

162
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:57,379
You don’t know what to say.

163
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:03,580
Here’s the truth: the examiners do not care
about your ideas or your opinions.

164
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,120
Not one bit.

165
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,079
There’s no ‘right’ answer.

166
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,990
If your answer is relevant and clear, then
it’s a good answer.

167
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,920
If it’s not relevant or not clear, then
it’s not a good answer.

168
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,600
Let’s do an example.

169
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,480
Here’s a common IELTS speaking question:

170
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,959
Tell me about your hometown.

171
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,939
Often, students will give answers like this:

172
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:26,699
Bangkok is the capital city of Thailand.

173
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:29,069
It has a population of ten million.

174
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:33,769
There are many tourist attractions in Bangkok,
such as the Grand Palace, which is very famous

175
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:34,970
and beautiful.

176
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,160
More than three million tourists visit the
Grand Palace every year.

177
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,519
Now, this isn’t a bad answer.

178
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,649
It’s quite good, in some ways!

179
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:46,920
But, it’s also very unnatural.

180
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,999
Think about it.

181
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:53,519
If you were in a social situation, like a
party, and someone asked you, “Hey, what’s

182
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,870
Bangkok like?” would you give an answer
like this?

183
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,389
No, almost certainly not.

184
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:01,740
Maybe you would, and that’s fine!

185
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,379
But, most people wouldn’t.

186
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:10,139
Many IELTS candidates try to talk and write
in this very unnatural way, because they think

187
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,839
it’s what the examiners want.

188
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,430
Here’s the problem: taking an exam is stressful.

189
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,779
Speaking a foreign language is hard.

190
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:23,410
Taking an exam in a foreign language is stressful
and hard.

191
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:29,600
Trying to talk in a very unnatural way, which
is totally different from how you communicate

192
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,630
naturally?

193
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,249
That just makes it harder.

194
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:35,399
Look at an alternative answer:

195
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,120
Bangkok’s never boring!

196
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,100
There’s so much going on all the time.

197
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,689
It has so many different neighbourhoods, and
they all have their own character.

198
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:50,259
Some things irritate me, but honestly I really
like living here and I couldn’t imagine

199
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:53,490
living anywhere else.

200
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:57,019
This answer sounds much more natural.

201
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:00,959
To be clear, ‘natural’ doesn’t mean
anything for your score.

202
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,240
Both answers you saw are good answers.

203
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,500
However, the second answer is more natural,
which means it’s probably easier for you

204
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
to produce.

205
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,370
It’s closer to how people talk in everyday
life.

206
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,850
IELTS is a test of your ability to communicate.

207
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,950
It doesn’t matter what your ideas or opinions
are.

208
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:26,759
It matters that you can express your ideas
and opinions clearly and in detail.

209
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:32,290
That sounds so easy, but many IELTS students
tell us, “I don’t have any ideas for most

210
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,290
of these topics.

211
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,449
I just don’t have anything to say.”

212
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:40,699
What about that?

213
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:46,260
Many students say, “I don’t know what
to talk about!”, especially for the essay

214
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,889
in the writing exam, or in parts two and three
of the speaking test.

215
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:55,519
IELTS questions and topics are designed to
be international.

216
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,940
They’re not about UK culture or US culture,
or any single country.

217
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,720
However, that also means they’re not based
in your culture.

218
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,059
There might be topics which people don’t
talk about in your country.

219
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:14,750
There might be topics which aren’t very
relevant to where you live.

220
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:20,120
The IELTS exam is about your ability to communicate
in an English-speaking environment.

221
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,769
That includes talking about things you may
not have thought about before.

222
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,939
Plus, sometimes, IELTS questions are just
plain weird.

223
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,180
“Have you ever planted a tree?”

224
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,560
Maria?

225
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,860
What?

226
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,140
Exactly.

227
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,639
It’s a weird question, but it was in a real
IELTS speaking exam in the past.

228
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,829
You need to be ready for anything when you
go into the IELTS test.

229
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:47,529
So, what can you do?

230
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:51,170
Preparing for IELTS isn’t just about your
English.

231
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:57,569
You should also read, write and speak about
many different topics, and work out your own

232
00:13:57,569 --> 00:13:59,570
ideas about them.

233
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:04,639
For example, should children always obey their
parents?

234
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,249
Should the government put taxes on fast food?

235
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:15,140
Is it better to choose a course at university
that will lead to a good job, or is it better

236
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,300
to study something you love learning about?

237
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:25,769
To be a strong IELTS candidate, you should
have clear, detailed opinions about all these

238
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:28,180
topics, and many, many more.

239
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,300
You should also try to be aware of other people’s
ideas.

240
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:37,550
Maybe, in your country, people choose a subject
at university that will lead to a good job.

241
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,420
Maybe you never even thought about the idea
of studying something just because you’re

242
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,869
interested in it.

243
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:44,329
Fine, no problem.

244
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:46,540
We’re not here to tell you what to think!

245
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,120
But, in some parts of the world, people have
different ideas.

246
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,100
You’ll be a better IELTS candidate if you
realise that.

247
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:01,360
So, read widely, write about different things,
and talk to as many people as possible about

248
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,160
as many topics as possible.

249
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,680
You can do this in your own language, but
of course it’s smarter to do it in English

250
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,709
if you can.

251
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:13,140
Don’t have anything to say about a topic?

252
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:20,160
Ask your friends, relatives, colleagues and
anyone else for their opinions.

253
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,999
Decide if you agree or disagree with what
other people say.

254
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:28,740
That way, you’ll start to form your own
opinion.

255
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,670
Again, this is a long-term process.

256
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,929
Preparing for IELTS isn’t just about going
to a class and studying from a textbook.

257
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:41,300
It’s about becoming a more effective communicator.

258
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:48,189
Let’s review the five things you need to
do to avoid the common IELTS mistakes you

259
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:50,189
saw in this lesson.

260
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:53,470
One: don’t leave your preparation too late.

261
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,679
Two: don’t look for ‘secret techniques’
or short cuts.

262
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,199
You’ll waste your time and money.

263
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:05,760
Three: read the scoring system, and understand
how scoring works.

264
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,800
Four: focus on expressing your own ideas,
not on what you think the examiners want you

265
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,089
to say.

266
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:21,160
Five: read, talk and learn about a wide range
of ideas and topics, so that you have well-developed

267
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,980
opinions of your own.

268
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,740
Thanks for watching, and good luck if you
have an IELTS exam coming up soon!

269
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,079
See you next time!
