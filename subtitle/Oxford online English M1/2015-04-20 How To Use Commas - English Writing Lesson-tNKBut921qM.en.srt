00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,060
Hello, I'm Oli.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,130
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,040
In this lesson, you can learn about using
commas.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,900
Students often seem very confused about commas
and how to use them correctly.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,289
Commas are quite complicated, because they
don't just do one thing.

6
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:22,630
Actually, commas have many different jobs
in the sentence.

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:28,279
So in this lesson, I'll explain the different
types of comma, what they do and how you can

8
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,109
use them.

9
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:34,940
Let's start with our first type of comma:
the listing comma.

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:41,540
As the name suggests, the listing comma is
used to list items or ideas one after another.

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:49,480
For example: "We need two cucumbers, four
tomatoes, some onions and a lettuce."

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,300
We use commas to separate the items on the
list.

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,030
Before the word 'and' in British English,
we don't usually use a comma.

14
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,990
In American English, a comma is often used
before 'and'.

15
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,390
It's your choice which style you use.

16
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,100
Both are correct.

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,259
This comma - the listing comma - replaces
the words 'and' or 'or'.

18
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:19,159
You could say: "We need two cucumbers and
four tomatoes and some onions and a lettuce."

19
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:25,770
It's not wrong, but it doesn't sound good,
so it's better to use the commas.

20
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,420
Your list could include phrases, or even complete
sentences.

21
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,350
The principle is the same.

22
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:38,579
For example: "We spent our time relaxing on
the beach, swimming in the sea and drinking

23
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,670
coffee in the seaside cafÃ©s."

24
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,900
In this case, the items on our list are whole
phrases; they're not just single words, but

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,719
the principle is the same.

26
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:56,289
We use a comma after each item, and in British
English, not before the word 'and'.

27
00:01:56,289 --> 00:02:02,840
You can also use the listing comma - sometimes-
to separate adjectives before a noun.

28
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,220
Look at two sentences: "She has long, dark,
shiny hair."

29
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,129
"He bought a bottle of dark, German beer."

30
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:17,370
In the first sentence, we use listing commas
to separate the adjectives.

31
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,290
In the second sentence, we don't.

32
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,019
Can you see why?

33
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:28,640
Well, remember we said that the listing comma
replaces the words 'and' or 'or'.

34
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,319
You can say: "She has long and dark and shiny
hair."

35
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,510
It doesn't sound good, but it's possible.

36
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,629
so in this case we use listing commas between
the adjectives.

37
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:46,829
But you cannot say: "He bought a bottle of
dark and German beer."

38
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:51,420
It's not possible, so in this case we don't
use listing commas.

39
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,819
If you're not sure, you can use this trick:
try replacing the commas with the word 'and'.

40
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,940
If it sounds OK, then you need commas.

41
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,560
If it doesn't sound right, you don't need
commas.

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,150
OK, what's our second comma?

43
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,680
It's the joining comma!

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,110
The joining comma is used to join two complete
sentences, together with a linking word.

45
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:21,610
For example: "We were tired, and we really
didn't feel like going anywhere."

46
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,379
In this sentence, each half of the sentence
could stand by itself.

47
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:33,780
"We were tired," is a complete sentence, and
"We really didn't feel like going anywhere,"

48
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,220
is also a complete sentence.

49
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:43,359
So we can put the two sentences together with
a comma and the linking word 'and'.

50
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:49,670
Other linking words you can use in this way
include 'and', 'but', 'or' or 'although'.

51
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,860
There are many others as well; that's not
a complete list.

52
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:59,209
However, you do need to be careful with these
commas; you can't use a comma to join two

53
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:03,170
complete sentences without using a linking
word.

54
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,459
You also can't use joining commas with some
linking words.

55
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:14,670
Let's practise: look at some sentences and
see if they're right or wrong.

56
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,000
Here are the four sentences.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,150
Read them, pause the video and think about
your answer - which are correct and which

58
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,780
are not correct in terms of comma use?

59
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,380
OK, ready?

60
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,820
Let's look at the answers.

61
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,510
(1) and (4) are correct.

62
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,530
(2) and (3) are not correct.

63
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,600
Let's see why.

64
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,950
Sentence two: "I applied for the job, I really
hope I get it," is not correct because there's

65
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,980
no linking word between the sentences.

66
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,120
You could say: "I applied for the job, and
I really hope I get it."

67
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,500
You could also say: "I applied for the job."

68
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,080
- full stop - "I really hope I get it."

69
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,490
But you can't use a comma to join two full
sentences like this.

70
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,139
In the second sentence: "She didn't get the
grades she needed, however she got into the

71
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,550
university in any case."

72
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:18,770
We use the linking word 'however', but we
don't use commas with 'however'.

73
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:24,520
The best way to link these sentences is with
a full stop, so we put a full stop after the

74
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,680
word 'needed', and then start a new sentence
with 'however'.

75
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,020
You might be thinking that number four is
wrong because the second part of the sentence

76
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,130
isn't a full sentence.

77
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,100
That's true, but the important point is that
it could be a full sentence.

78
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,270
You could say: "You'll either have to start
again, or you'll have to find someone to help

79
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,410
you."

80
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:54,650
We shorten the sentence to make it simpler
and easier to say, so it's OK to use the joining

81
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,919
comma here.

82
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,500
Number three is the bracketing comma.

83
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,790
This is possibly the most difficult comma
to use.

84
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:07,960
It's used to add an extra phrase or piece
of information into a sentence.

85
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,550
It's often used in pairs.

86
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:19,160
For example: "This book, first published in
1956, is still useful for students today."

87
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,389
The phrase in red is extra information about
the book, and so we put it between a pair

88
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:25,960
of commas.

89
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:33,370
"One of my colleagues, who used to be a semi-professional
footballer, invited me to play in their five-a-side

90
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,050
team this weekend."

91
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:41,199
Again, the information in red is extra information
about my colleague, and so the information

92
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:49,490
goes between a pair of commas.To use bracketing
commas, the sentence must make sense and be

93
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,220
grammatically complete without the extra information.

94
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:01,910
In these cases you can see that if we remove
the information in red: "This book is still

95
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:08,389
useful for students today" - that's still
a complete sentence and it makes sense.

96
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:13,889
Also, if I say: "One of my colleagues invited
me to play in their five-a-side team this

97
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:19,930
weekend," again, that's a full sentence; it's
grammatically correct; it's clear - we don't

98
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:27,270
need the information between the bracketing
commas for the sentence to make sense.

99
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:33,789
In both cases, the sentence is complete and
the meaning is clear without the extra information.

100
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:37,600
This makes it easy to see if your commas are
correct or not.

101
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,040
If you're using commas in this way, ask yourself
whether the sentence would make sense without

102
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,880
the phrase between commas.

103
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,620
If not, something is wrong.

104
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:56,319
For example: "He was a strict, and sometimes
cruel leader, who was feared by his staff."

105
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:04,159
This might look OK, but if we try to remove
the red text between commas, we get: "He was

106
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:07,300
a strict who was feared by his staff."

107
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,470
This doesn't make sense.

108
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,729
He was a strict what?

109
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:18,229
Another example: "Pens, which can write upside-down,
are used by NASA astronauts on the International

110
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:19,229
Space Station."

111
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:28,629
Again, it looks OK, but if we remove the red
text - the extra information - we get: "Pens

112
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:32,530
are used by NASA astronauts on the International
Space Station."

113
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:38,950
Now this is a clear sentence and it's grammatically
correct, but it has a different meaning.

114
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,690
We didn't want to say that just any pens are
used.

115
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:48,940
We wanted to say that a special kind of pen
is used, so we've changed the meaning of the

116
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,020
sentence.

117
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,100
If the extra phrase is near the beginning
or the end of a sentence, you might just use

118
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,200
one bracketing comma instead of using a pair.

119
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,940
Let's look: "Similar to most people his age,
he isn't really thinking about his future."

120
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,650
Again, the text in red is extra information,
but it comes at the beginning of the sentence.

121
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,500
That means we don't need two commas; we can
just use one.

122
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,800
"He told me that he wanted to quit and become
a painter, which surprised me."

123
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,890
Again, it's extra information, but it's at
the end of the sentence, so we just use one

124
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,810
comma and then a full stop.

125
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,790
Finally, let's look at some common mistakes
with commas.

126
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,149
There are three mistakes which I see students
making a lot.

127
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:43,630
Let's look so you can hopefully avoid making
these mistakes.

128
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:48,240
Don't put a comma between a subject and its
verb.

129
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,470
For example, this sentence is incorrect, because
'The people we met on holiday' is the subject;

130
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,380
'were' is the main verb.

131
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:04,290
There should not be a comma between the subject
and the main verb.

132
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,070
In this sentence, we have the same problem.

133
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:13,040
The subject, again, is not one word; it's
a phrase: 'Everything in those cupboards'.

134
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,990
The main verb is 'needs', so again, there
should not be a comma between the subject

135
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,820
and the main verb.

136
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,110
Don't use a comma before 'that'.

137
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,070
This is a useful rule, because it's quite
easy.

138
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:34,639
"She told me, that she wanted to move to London,"
or: "I had no idea, that he could speak Japanese."

139
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:41,240
In both of these sentences there should not
be a comma before 'that'.

140
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:47,280
Don't use a comma to join two sentences if
you don't use a linking word.

141
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:53,880
In this case, both parts of the sentence before
and after the comma could be full sentences

142
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,800
by themselves.

143
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,480
So in this case, you either need to use a
linking word, like 'and' or ' but' or 'or'

144
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,130
or something like that, or you need to use
a full stop after 'year'.

145
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,690
You can't use a comma like this.

146
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,110
Here, we have the same problem.

147
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,720
We have two ideas.

148
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,740
Each idea could be a sentence by itself, and
there's no linking word, so we can't use a

149
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:26,770
comma to join two complete sentences like
this without a linking word.

150
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,500
OK, that's the end of the lesson.

151
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,970
I hope it was useful.

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:36,070

your comma skill, come to our website: www.oxfordonlineenglish.com.

154
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,079
There are also many other free English lessons
there.

155
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,079
But that's all.

156
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,070
Thanks again for watching, and I'll see you
