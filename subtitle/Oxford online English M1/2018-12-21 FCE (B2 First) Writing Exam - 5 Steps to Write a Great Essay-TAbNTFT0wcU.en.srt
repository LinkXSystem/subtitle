00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,770
Hi, I’m Kasia.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,580
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:10,960
In this lesson you can learn how to write
an essay for the Cambridge FCE exam, step

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,049
by step.

5
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:19,800
You’ll see exactly what to do at each stage
and how to get the best possible score.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,190
There are four steps to the writing process.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:28,110
You’ll see what to do at each step, then
you’ll learn how the writing is assessed.

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,160
I said there were four steps to the process.

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:42,390
So what’s first? First, you need to read
the task and identify exactly what needs to

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,579
be included.

11
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:51,050
Let’s look at a sample question: You've recently
had a discussion in English class about society.

12
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,410
Now your teacher has asked you to write an
essay.

13
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,380
Write an essay using all the notes and give
reasons for your point of view.

14
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,160
University should be free for everyone.

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,550
Do you agree or disagree?

16
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,610
Notes

17
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,070
Taxes

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,070
Opportunity

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,870
Your own idea
Okay, so what do you need to do?

20
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:23,410
Most importantly, you need to say if you agree
or disagree that university should be free

21
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,110
for everyone.

22
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:31,800
You also need to use all the notes and give
reasons for your point of view.

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:39,750
That means your essay needs to include three
central ideas: taxes, opportunity, and one

24
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,390
other.

25
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,640
It also means that you need to reach a clear,
justified conclusion.

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,230
You can’t just say, ‘I agree’, or ‘I
disagree.’

27
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:56,850
Think of it like this: you need to convince
the examiner that your conclusion is correct.

28
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,680
You might think at this point, ‘yeah, obvious,
thanks for the help, Kasia!’

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,230
Trust me; it’s harder than it sounds.

30
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,649
Many FCE essays that we see don’t get these
basic things right.

31
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:14,489
It’s very easy to leave something out, or
to go in the wrong direction.

32
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:19,459
Next, you’re writing this answer for your
teacher so what style do you think it will

33
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:20,829
be in?

34
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,709
Formal or informal?

35
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:26,499
An essay should be formal.

36
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:29,290
What does that mean?

37
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:36,030
Formal writing doesn’t use contractions,
like ‘I’d’, ‘you’re’ or ‘don’t’.

38
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,340
Write the full forms.

39
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,060
You should also avoid using slang, colloquial
vocabulary, or anything which sounds very

40
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,250
conversational.

41
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:50,379
Next, think: what do you need to include?

42
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:57,950
You need to talk about taxes, opportunity,
and you also need to add your own idea.

43
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:04,569
Even the ideas which are given to you—taxes
and opportunity—are quite vague.

44
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:09,629
That means you need to decide exactly what
to talk about.

45
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:13,379
You also need to think about how to connect
your ideas.

46
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:19,440
For example, with taxes you could say that
if you pay taxes, then this should go back

47
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,730
into society to benefit everyone.

48
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:29,650
You could add to this by pointing out that
having equal opportunities also benefits society.

49
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,489
And for your own idea, you could talk about
how people with higher education are more

50
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:38,169
likely to be economically productive.

51
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:40,749
This is just one example, of course!

52
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:43,150
There are many paths you could take.

53
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,280
Let’s talk about that in more detail.

54
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,340
Here’s what you need to do when you plan
your essay.

55
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:57,920
First, you need to decide what your conclusion
is going to be.

56
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,269
Are you going to agree or disagree that university
should be free for everyone?

57
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:10,029
Decide your conclusion first, because everything
else in your essay needs to lead to it.

58
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:15,920
Secondly, you need to plan how many paragraphs
you’re going to have, and what you’ll

59
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,410
put in each one.

60
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,820
Thirdly, you need to make sure your paragraphs
are connected to your conclusion.

61
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,810
Let’s see an example:
Pause the video if you want some more time

62
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,830
to read the plan.

63
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:39,370
You can see that we use the key idea of ‘education’
in the notes for each paragraph.

64
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,340
Doing this can help you to stay focused and
on-topic, because you’re connecting each

65
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,960
paragraph back to the main idea of the question.

66
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,870
When you plan, make sure that each paragraph
has a clear focus.

67
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,680
Do you know what every good paragraph starts
with?

68
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,900
A topic sentence.

69
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,720
What’s a topic sentence?

70
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,530
A topic sentence is the first sentence of
a paragraph.

71
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,599
It summarises the main point of the paragraph.

72
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:19,680
The sentences which follow are called supporting
sentences.

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,849
These include reasons and examples to support
your topic sentence.

74
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:31,680
A good exercise during planning is to take
a paragraph and think to yourself: “What’s

75
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,659
this paragraph about?”

76
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:39,889
If you can answer that question in one simple
sentence, then that’s a good sign.

77
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,289
Hopefully, your plan is clear.

78
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:48,110
However, if you can’t answer that question,
that shows that your plan isn’t totally

79
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,110
clear in your head.

80
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:56,530
Once you’ve finished your plan, you’re
ready to write your answer!

81
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,509
In your candidate answer book, you will now
write your essay.

82
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:05,789
Let’s look at a model answer:

83
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:10,030
Pause the video to read, and start again when
you’re ready.

84
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,300
First question: have we answered the question?

85
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:21,380
Yes: the conclusion states that free university
benefits all members of society.

86
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:27,000
This shows that we agree that university should
be free for everyone.

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,520
Next: have we used topic sentences?

88
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,139
Yes, we have.

89
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:39,289
The first sentence of the essay tells you
what the entire essay will be about.

90
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:45,620
Then, each paragraph’s topic sentence contains
a key word from our plan.

91
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,629
We have ‘taxes, ‘opportunities’ and
‘economy’.

92
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:56,410
Also, the topic sentences and paragraphs all
reference the idea of ‘education’, either

93
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,380
directly or indirectly.

94
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,650
This shows that our points are relevant and
connected to the task.

95
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,710
So, now you’re finished, right?

96
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:17,740
No--there’s one more step. This answer is not bad, but it could be better.

97
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,370
The final step is to check your answer.

98
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,200
What type of things do you think you should
look for?

99
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,490
Grammar, of course, but what else?

100
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,330
Check for spelling mistakes.

101
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,819
Check for style—have you used any conversational
language which doesn’t fit the tone of an

102
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,880
essay like this?

103
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,080
Check your use of linking words and phrases.

104
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:50,139
Many students overuse them; don’t use a
linking word like nevertheless unless you’re

105
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:52,159
sure it fits.

106
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,760
Check for repetition of vocabulary.

107
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:00,140
Could you replace any simple vocabulary with
something more advanced?

108
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,120
Look at our model answer again:

109
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:10,349
The underlined parts are either mistakes,
or they could be improved somehow.

110
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:12,639
How would you improve this?

111
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,169
Pause the video while you read and decide.

112
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:21,250
The first problem is with grammar.

113
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,419
Unless you’re talking about one specific
university, you don’t use 'the'.

114
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:29,439
Okay, what’s wrong with doesn’t?

115
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,690
We’ve used a contraction!

116
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,409
Don’t use contractions in your essay.

117
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:38,180
So, it should be does not.

118
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,539
The next problem is a spelling mistake.

119
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:48,720
When a word ends in ‘y’, it changes to
‘ies’ in the plural.

120
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,660
Next is a punctuation mistake.

121
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,790
There’s a comma missing.

122
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:58,620
There are two clauses in this sentence and
they need to be separated by a comma.

123
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,840
There’s nothing wrong with people with degrees
but it’s quite basic.

124
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,620
What else could you say?

125
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:16,850
You could say educated people, or even highly-educated
people, either of which is slightly more elegant.

126
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:23,230
So is not a mistake, but we used ‘so’
in the second paragraph already.

127
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,600
You want to show the examiner your range of
language, so here you could use something

128
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,160
more precise like consequently.

129
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,389
Our conclusion is only one sentence, so let’s
add an extra point.

130
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:41,940
We’re still under the maximum word count.

131
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:49,360
Let’s change it to: In conclusion, free
university should be free for everyone.

132
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,420
It makes economic sense and ultimately benefits
all members of society.

133
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,540
At this point, it’s looking good!

134
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:03,670
Next, let’s focus on what you can do to
produce a good FCE essay which will get a

135
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,860
high score in your exam.

136
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,070
Your essay score is made up of four parts.

137
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,800
For each part, you get a score from zero to
five.

138
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,680
First there’s ‘Content’.

139
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,010
The mark scheme says this “focuses on how
well you have fulfilled the task”.

140
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:30,490
In other words, have you done everything you
were asked to do?

141
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,160
This corresponds to step one of our writing
process.

142
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,630
Analyse the task carefully and make sure you
do everything it asks you to.

143
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:46,010
A good tip is to underline the key words in
the task to help you identify what you need

144
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,640
to do.

145
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,460
Next there’s ‘Communicative Achievement’.

146
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,820
This “focuses on how appropriate your writing
is for the task”.

147
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,610
Have you used the correct register?

148
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,779
Have you used contractions?

149
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:07,620
Basically: does your essay look and sound
like an essay?

150
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,540
Then we have organisation.

151
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,050
This looks at “how the writing is put together”.

152
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,790
Is it logical and organised?

153
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,850
By planning your writing correctly, it will
already be organised.

154
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:27,709
Remember to plan your paragraphs carefully
and write a clear topic sentence at the beginning

155
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:29,720
of each paragraph.

156
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,920
You can also use linking words and phrases
to make the connections between paragraphs

157
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,980
even clearer.

158
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:43,699
In our essay, we used many linking words,
including firstly, secondly, in addition,

159
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:46,889
although, consequently and in conclusion.

160
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:52,940
Look through the essay again, and note how
the linking words and phrases are used.

161
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:58,020
Can you find any more examples of linking
words in the essay?

162
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,820
Finally, you have ‘Language’: vocabulary
and grammar.

163
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:08,990
The examiners will be looking for a range
of language as well as how accurate it is.

164
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,300
In step four, you saw how checking your essay
can improve your language.

165
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,630
Are you worried that making mistakes will
affect your mark?

166
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:24,380
Of course, making a lot of mistakes will lower
your mark, but remember this is only one part

167
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,290
of the score.

168
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:32,540
For B2 level, the Cambridge mark scheme says,
‘Occasional errors may be present but do

169
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,180
not impede communication.’

170
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,790
That means you can still score 5 from 5, even
with some small mistakes.

171
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:47,040
But, hopefully, you’ll catch most of them
when you’re on step four – checking and

172
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,870
improving your answer.

173
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:55,240
You’ve seen how to write an essay for FCE,
but you can use the same process for other

174
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,380
Cambridge exams, including the CAE and CPE
when you get that far.

175
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,900
