00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,220
Hi.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,560
My name is Rheedan.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,800
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,200
Today, you can learn about the most important
verb in English: "to be."

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,609
You'll learn how to use "be" in simple sentences
and questions.

6
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:19,580
The verb, "be," is everywhere in English.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:25,440
We use it all the time, so you need to know
how to use "be" correctly.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,640
Do you know the sentence: "To be or not to
be, that is the question."

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,120
It's from Shakespeare's "Hamlet."

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,250
It's only 10 words long and uses the word
"to be" three times.

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:45,010
So if you want to speak well, practicing the
verb "to be" will help your English.

12
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,470
How to use different forms of "be."

13
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,010
"Be" has different forms.

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,210
Let's look.

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,940
We say, "I am.

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,010
You are.

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,960
He/she/it is.

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,390
We are.

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,390
You are.

20
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,370
They are."

21
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,659
Do you know these forms?

22
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:10,170
If not, repeat them again and again until
you know them perfectly.

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,040
Let's do it one more time.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,130
"I am.

25
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,200
You are.

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,280
He/she/it is.

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,720
We are.

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,010
You are.

29
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,000
They are."

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,140
What about my brother?

31
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,820
My brother am?

32
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,390
My brother are?

33
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,030
My brother is?

34
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,670
Which is correct?

35
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,640
My brother = he.

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,549
My brother is.

37
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:39,590
What about the cups?

38
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,260
The cups am?

39
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,920
The cups are?

40
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,700
The cups is?

41
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,280
Which is correct?

42
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,330
The cups = they.

43
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,270
The cups are.

44
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,450
Next, let's look at how to make simple sentences
with "be."

45
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,710
How can we use "be?"

46
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,630
There are many ways.

47
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,270
We can use "be" with a number: "I am 29 years
old."

48
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,200
"You are 190 centimeters tall."

49
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,120
"It is 5:00."

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,150
We can use "be" with a noun, to say what something
is: "He is a doctor."

51
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,440
"She is a student."

52
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,050
"It is a cookbook."

53
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,970
You can use "be" with an adjective, like hungry
or quiet: "We are hungry."

54
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,590
"You are very quiet."

55
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,410
"They are German."

56
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,280
OK, what if you want to make a negative sentence?

57
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,230
It's easy to make negative sentences with
"be."

58
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,640
Just add "not" after the verb.

59
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,040
"I am 29 years old --> I am not 29 years old."

60
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,010
"Sarah is a student --> Sarah is not a student."

61
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,950
"We are hungry --> We are not hungry."

62
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,849
What about, "He is a doctor."?

63
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,530
Can you make it negative?

64
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,670
"He is not a doctor."

65
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,590
Easy, right?

66
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,590
Good.

67
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,569
Let's look at how to make short forms, contractions,
with "be."

68
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:16,400
When we speak, we often make short forms,
also called contractions, with "be."

69
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,340
What am I talking about?

70
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,459
You saw the example: "I am 29 years old."

71
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:24,209
We don't usually say this.

72
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,810
We usually say, "I'm 29 years old."

73
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,160
"I'm" is a short form, or contraction.

74
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,879
We take two words and put them together.

75
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,310
This is easier to say.

76
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,440
Let's look at some more short forms with the
verb "be."

77
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,629
"I am --> I'm."

78
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,680
"You are --> You're."

79
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,270
"He is --> He's."

80
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,590
"She is --> She's."

81
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,910
"It is --> It's."

82
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,990
"We are --> We're."

83
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,040
"They are --> They're."

84
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,709
You can also make short forms with nouns.

85
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:11,099
"Sarah is a student --> Sarah's a student."

86
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,980
"My camera is Japanese --> My camera's Japanese."

87
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,440
What about short forms with negatives?

88
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
Let's look.

89
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,530
"I am not --> I'm not."

90
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:29,950
"You are not --> You aren't; You're not."

91
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:35,880
"He is not --> He isn't; He's not."

92
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,790
"She is not --> She isn't; She's not."

93
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,000
"It is not --> It isn't; It's not."

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,840
"We are not --> We aren't; We're not."

95
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:59,750
"They are not --> They aren't; They're not."

96
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,680
Let's look at some examples: "I am not 29."

97
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,430
"I'm not 29."

98
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,639
"He is not a doctor."

99
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,810
"He isn't a doctor," or: "He's not a doctor."

100
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,130
OK, your turn.

101
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,919
"It is not a cookbook."

102
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,900
What are the two short forms?

103
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:29,340
"It isn't a cookbook," or: "It's not a cookbook."

104
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,370
Let's do one more: "They are not German."

105
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,800
Can you make the short forms?

106
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,979
"They aren't German," or: "They're not German."

107
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:45,870
When you speak English, remember to use short
forms with "be."

108
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,930
You'll sound more natural.

109
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,949
Let's learn to do one more thing with "be."

110
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:55,510
Let's see how to use "be" to make simple yes/no
questions.

111
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,759
Look at the sentence: "He is a doctor."

112
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,930
Can you make a yes/no question from this sentence?

113
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,199
"Is he a doctor?"

114
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,430
What happened?

115
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,750
We moved the verb "be" to the beginning.

116
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,509
Let's look at another example.

117
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:15,539
"Sarah is a student."

118
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,560
Can you make the question?

119
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,669
"Is Sarah a student?"

120
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:26,680
OK, one more, a bit different: "You are Italian."

121
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,810
Can you make the question?

122
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,240
"Are you Italian?"

123
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,610
The same thing happens.

124
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,870
Just move "be" to the beginning.

125
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,280
What about, "They are German?"

126
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,110
Can you make the question?

127
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,539
"Are they German?"

128
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:44,880
Same idea again.

129
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,080
Not too difficult, right?

130
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Okay.

131
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,650
Let's review what we've studied in this class.

132
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,620
Can you remember what you learned in this
lesson?

133
00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:01,199
We saw how to make simple sentences with "be,"
how to make short forms with "be," and how

134
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,470
to make simple questions with "be."

135
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,340
Remember, you can watch the video again to
review the topic if you want to.

136
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,490
Want more practice?

137
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:17,130
Look at the full lesson on our website: www.oxfordonlineenglish.com.

138
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,710
That's the end of the lesson.

139
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,979
Thanks very much for watching.

140
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,389
I hope you found it useful.

141
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:23,199
See you next time!
