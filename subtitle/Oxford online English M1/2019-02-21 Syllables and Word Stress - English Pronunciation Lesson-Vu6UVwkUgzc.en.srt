1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,610
Hi, I’m Mikey.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,900
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,330
In this lesson, you can learn about syllables
and stress in English.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,690
Do you know what stress means?

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,559
It’s one of the most important pronunciation
points in English.

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,800
When you speak English, do other people find
it difficult to understand what you’re saying?

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,180
If so, you might not be using stress correctly.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,680
Pronouncing words with the correct stress
can make a big difference to your English:

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,829
your English will immediately sound clearer
and more natural.

10
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:42,560
You’ll learn all about stress in this lesson,
but first, we need to talk about syllables.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,640
Listen to four words:

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,260
fast
person

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,300
beautiful
information

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,160
Do you know how many syllables these words
have?

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,860
Fast has one syllable: fast
Person has two syllables: per-son.

16
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:13,760
Beautiful has three syllables: beau-ti-ful
Information has four syllables: in-for-ma-tion

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,960
A syllable has one vowel sound (and only one
vowel sound) and one or more consonant sounds.

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,580
Let’s do some more practice.

19
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,540
Look at four more words:

20
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,180
breakfast
banana

21
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,240
tomorrow
university

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,860
How many syllables do they have?

23
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,300
Breakfast has two syllables: break-fast.

24
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,540
Banana has three syllables: ba-na-na.

25
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:52,080
Tomorrow has three syllables: to-mor-row.

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:58,920
University has five syllables: u-ni-ver-si-ty.

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,860
So, this lesson isn’t really about syllables;
it’s about stress.

28
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,740
What’s the connection between syllables
and stress?

29
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,500
Think about the word banana.

30
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,040
Banana has three syllables.

31
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,080
Do you pronounce all the syllables the same:
bah-nah-nah?

32
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,260
No, you don't—one syllable is stronger:
ba-NA-na.

33
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,060
This is stress.

34
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,180
If a word has one syllable, you don't need
to think about stress.

35
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:36,600
But, if a word has two syllables or more,
one syllable is always stressed: it has a

36
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,800
strong, clear pronunciation.

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,500
Let’s practice pronouncing word stress correctly.

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,540
Let’s look at an example you just saw.

39
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,640
banana

40
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you remember where the stress is?

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,800
It’s on the second syllable: ba-NA-na.

42
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,540
What makes the stressed syllable different?

43
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,200
There are three things you need to do to pronounce
stress correctly.

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,380
One: the stressed syllable should be louder.

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,300
Two: the stressed syllable should be a little
higher.

46
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,719
Three: the stressed syllable should be a little
longer in time.

47
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,420
Let’s practice.

48
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,280
First, listen to three words you saw before:
person

49
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,840
beautiful
information

50
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,940
Here, I was exaggerating the stress so that
you can hear it clearly.

51
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,799
You don’t need to pronounce the stress this
strongly.

52
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,250
However, when you practice, it’s a good
idea to try to overpronounce the stress a

53
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,319
little.

54
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,120
This will make sure that you are pronouncing
it correctly.

55
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,100
So, where is the stress in these three words?

56
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,080
Listen again, and this time, repeat the words
after me: person,

57
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,920
beautiful,
information.

58
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:05,700
Let’s try one more time: person,
beautiful,

59
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,099
information.

60
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,260
How was that?

61
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,989
Could you pronounce the stress clearly?

62
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:15,340
Next, let’s look at four more words you
saw before:

63
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,680
breakfast
banana

64
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,300
tomorrow
university

65
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,080
This time, I pronounced the stress in a more
natural way.

66
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,360
Could you hear it?

67
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,660
Where is the stress in these four words?

68
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:39,140
Let’s try one more time: breakfast,
banana,

69
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,500
tomorrow, university.

70
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,480
When you look up a word, you can find the
stress by looking at the phonetic transcription.

71
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,820
The thing that looks like an apostrophe
shows you where the stress is.

72
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,850
When you see this apostrophe, the next syllable
is the stressed syllable.

73
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,620
When you write down new vocabulary, make sure
you record the stress, too.

74
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,970
You can put a mark over the stressed syllable,
or underline it.

75
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,800
At this point, you might be thinking: are
there any rules about word stress?

76
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,060
How do I know where the word stress is if
I don’t have a dictionary?

77
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,260
Let’s talk about that.

78
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,160
We’ve got good news and bad news for you.

79
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,740
The good news is that there are some rules
about word stress in English.

80
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,020
The bad news is that the rules don’t cover
everything, and even the rules which you do

81
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,620
have don’t work all the time.

82
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,389
Here’s one rule which is quite useful.

83
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:40,540
It’s about words with two syllables.

84
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,770
Look at five words:

85
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,289
picture
minute

86
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:47,940
money
doctor

87
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,330
water

88
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,280
All these words have two syllables.

89
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,270
Where’s the stress?

90
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,560
In all the words, the stress is on the 1st
syllable.

91
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,660
There’s a reason for this: can you work
it out?

92
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,639
What connects these five words?

93
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,340
These words are all nouns.

94
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,080
Nouns with two syllables usually have stress
on the 1st syllable.

95
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,010
Let’s practice saying the words together.

96
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:26,440
Repeat after me: picture, minute, money, doctor,
water.

97
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,060
This is also true for most adjectives with
two syllables:

98
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:34,240
happy
yellow

99
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,330
useful
formal

100
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,939
tiring

101
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:40,620
What about verbs?

102
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,870
Look at some examples and try to work out
the rule:

103
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,340
decide
forget

104
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,000
explain
arrive

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
repeat

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,889
Can you hear the stress?

107
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,539
The stress is on the second syllable.

108
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:00,080
Let’s practice saying the words together.

109
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:09,880
Repeat after me: decide, forget, explain,
arrive, repeat.

110
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,180
So, most nouns and adjectives with two syllables
have the stress on the first syllable, and

111
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,909
most verbs have the stress on the second syllable.

112
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:28,680
Be careful, because there are many common
exceptions, like hotel, happen, exam, or finish.

113
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,370
What about longer words?

114
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,740
Are there any rules you can use to find the
stress?

115
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:41,340
In three-syllable words, the stress can be
anywhere; it can be at the beginning:

116
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,860
anyone
beautiful

117
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,400
possible

118
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,490
It can be in the middle:

119
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,960
computer
tomorrow

120
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,199
expensive

121
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,240
It can also be at the end, although this is
less common:

122
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,199
afternoon
employee

123
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,920
Japanese

124
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,520
Let’s practice!

125
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:10,100
Repeat after me: beautiful, tomorrow, employee.

126
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:18,560
Let’s try three more: anyone, computer,
Japanese.

127
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,680
In words with four or more syllables, the
stress is almost always in the middle of the

128
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,409
word, not on the first or last syllable.

129
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:28,860
For example:

130
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,039
information
communicate

131
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,760
photographer

132
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:44,560
Try saying the words after me: information,
communicate, photographer.

133
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,269
There are some other rules which can help
you to find the stress in longer words.

134
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:51,140
Let’s look together.

135
00:08:51,140 --> 00:09:02,420
If a word ends -tion, -sion or -cian, then
the stress is always on the second last syllable:

136
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,240
information
discussion

137
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,389
politician

138
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:12,680
Can you think of three more words like this?

139
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:20,579
There are many, but here are three more suggestions:
situation, revision, electrician.

140
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:25,890
The same rule is true for words ending -ic:

141
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,700
economic
dramatic

142
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,020
Atlantic
scientific

143
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:40,380
Again, all these words have the stress on
the second last syllable.

144
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:46,510
If a word ends with the letter -y and has
three or more syllables, then the stress is

145
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,740
two syllables before the last one.

146
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,170
For example:

147
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,620
biology
luckily

148
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,300
activity
possibility

149
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:05,839
That means, if a word has three syllables
and ends in -y, the stress is almost always

150
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,100
on the first syllable:

151
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,170
chemistry
pregnancy

152
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,560
robbery

153
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,980
There’s one more rule which could help you
here: if a longer word is made from a shorter

154
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:24,230
root word, then the stress is generally in
the same place as the root word.

155
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,820
For example:

156
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,900
comfort
comfortable

157
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,080
discomfort
uncomfortable

158
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,500
comfortably
comforting

159
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:41,190
In all these words, the stress is in the same
place as the root word, comfort.

160
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,640
However, the rules you saw before take priority.

161
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,949
This means that the stress can move when you
make a longer word from a root word.

162
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:52,480
For example:

163
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:01,760
photograph -> photography -> photographic
economy -> economic

164
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,250
educate -> education
Okay, now you’ve learned about stress, how

165
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,140
to pronounce it, and how you can find the
stress in different words.

166
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:19,250
But, there’s still one more very important
thing you should know about.

167
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:25,480
Want to know a secret that will improve your
English pronunciation really fast?

168
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,900
Here’s the most important point about word
stress: it’s about contrast.

169
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,630
That means, when you pronounce word stress,
it’s not just about the stressed syllable.

170
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,540
You also need to think about the unstressed
syllables.

171
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:46,529
Remember that to pronounce stress, you make
the stressed syllable louder, higher and longer.

172
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:53,779
Stress is about contrast, so the opposite
is true for unstressed syllables: you need

173
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:57,740
to make them quieter, lower and shorter.

174
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,100
Let’s look at three words you’ve already
practiced:

175
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,800
banana
person

176
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
information

177
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,300
To pronounce the words well, you need to think
about the unstressed syllables, too.

178
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:16,360
Often, the vowel sounds in the unstressed
syllables are reduced to schwa sounds--/ə/,

179
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,480
or short /ɪ/ sounds.

180
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,529
‘Reduced’ means the vowel sounds are shorter
and weaker.

181
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:30,019
For example, in the word banana, the stress
is on the second syllable: ba-NA-na.

182
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:36,320
The stressed ‘a’ has an /aː/ sound, but
the other two ‘a’s’ have schwa sounds:

183
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,680
banana.

184
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,500
In the word person, the first syllable is
stressed, and the second syllable has a schwa

185
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,380
sound: person.

186
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:51,720
And in information, the syllables before and
after the stressed syllable reduce to schwas:

187
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,820
information.

188
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:59,360
Unstressed syllables can’t always be reduced,
but they often can be.

189
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:04,060
If a vowel sound is reduced, it most often
shortens to a schwa sound.

190
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:11,240
We’ll finish with a simple tip to help you
pronounce word stress clearly and naturally.

191
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,880
Focus on the stressed syllable, and put more
stress on it than you think you need.

192
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,820
Pronounce the unstressed syllables as fast
as you can.

193
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,160
If you do this, you’ll have contrast in
your pronunciation, and this will make your

194
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,320
word stress sound natural and clear.

195
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,959
Finally, we have a question for you: what
do you think is the most important pronunciation

196
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,050
skill to speak clearly in English?
