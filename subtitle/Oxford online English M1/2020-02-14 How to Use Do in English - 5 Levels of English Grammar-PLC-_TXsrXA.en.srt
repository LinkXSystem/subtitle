00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,430

Turn them on now by clicking the ‘CC’
button in the bottom right.

11
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:47,280
This is a ‘5 levels’ lesson.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,510
That means you’ll see five sections.

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,269
Each section will give you a challenge.

14
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:56,960
Each section is more difficult than the previous
ones.

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,030
The early sections will focus mostly on grammar;
higher levels will test your grammar and vocabulary

16
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,210
skills!

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:12,840
Level one is beginner, so if you’re not
a beginner, you should skip to level two.

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,320
Ready?

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,380
Let’s go!

20
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,200
Look at five sentences.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,540
Complete each sentence with one word.

22
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,440
Each word is a form of the verb ‘do’.

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,960
Contractions, like ‘don’t’, count as
one word.

24
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,900
Pause the video and do it now.

25
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,280
Ready?

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,860
Here are the answers.

27
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,100
What do you need to know here?

28
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,590
Use ‘do’ to make negatives and questions
in the present simple

29
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,140
and the past simple.

30
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,090
For example, take a positive sentence: ‘I
like bananas.’

31
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,560
Make a negative: ‘I *don’t* like bananas.’

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,400
Make a question: ‘Do you like bananas?’

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:22,960
If you’re talking in the 3rd person – he,
she or it – use ‘does’ and ‘doesn’t’.

34
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,860
Take a positive sentence: ‘She likes bananas.’

35
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:34,110
Make a negative: ‘She doesn’t like bananas.’

36
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,560
Make a question: ‘Does she like bananas?’

37
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:48,020
In the past simple, use ‘didn’t’ to
make negatives, and ‘did’ to make questions.

38
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,280
Take a positive sentence: ‘They arrived
early.’

39
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,230
Make a negative: ‘They didn’t arrive early.’

40
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,440
Make a question: ‘Did they arrive early?’

41
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,660
There’s one exception.

42
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:13,400
Don’t use ‘do’, ‘don’t’, ‘did’
or ‘didn’t’ with the verb ‘be’,

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,900
or with modal verbs like ‘can’.

44
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:23,700
Verbs like ‘be’ and ‘can’ make their
own negatives and questions, without using

45
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,420
‘do’.

46
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,840
Clear?

47
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:31,380
If not, you can review this section again.

48
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,900
If you think it’s difficult, you should
study the present simple and past simple verb

49
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,240
tenses.

50
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,680
Focus on how to form negative sentences and
questions.

51
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:51,780
If everything’s OK, then let’s move on
to level two!

52
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,040
Here’s your challenge for level two.

53
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:02,760
Your job is to put the words in order to make
a *question*.

54
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,950
That’s important: you need to make a question,
not a sentence.

55
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:14,940
Pause the video and think about your answers
now.

56
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,460
Ready?

57
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,840
Let’s look.

58
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,720
What does the first question – what do you
do?

59
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,620
– mean?

60
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,340
It means ‘what’s your job?’.

61
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,660
It’s common in spoken English.

62
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:39,770
In level one, you saw that you use ‘do’
to make questions in the present and past

63
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,699
simple.

64
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,580
There are different kinds of question you
can make, but there’s another point here.

65
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,270
‘Do’ can be two things.

66
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,170
It can be a main verb, which has real meaning.

67
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:02,480
It can also be an auxiliary verb, which you
use to make negatives and questions.

68
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,050
It can also do both things in the same sentence.

69
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:15,280
All these questions use ‘do’ twice, once
as a main verb, and once as an auxiliary verb.

70
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,970
This is extremely common in English!

71
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:25,190
Anyway, let’s look at some different ways
you can use ‘do’ to make questions.

72
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:30,960
You can make yes/no questions, which start
with the word ‘do’, ‘does’, and so

73
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,430
on.

74
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,630
For example, see question three.

75
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:44,880
You can make questions with a question word,
like ‘what’, ‘where’, ‘who’, and

76
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,500
so on.

77
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,710
See question one for an example.

78
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:59,210
You can also make questions with a question
tag, like numbers two and five.

79
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,280
This can have several different meanings.

80
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,610
You can use a tag question to check something,
when you think you know the answer already.

81
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,680
You can also use it to show surprise or interest.

82
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:21,100
Here’s a question: in number two, the question
tag is negative – ‘don’t you?’

83
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,740
– but in number five, the tag is positive
– ‘do you?’

84
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,020
Do you know why?

85
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:36,110
If you want to check information, meaning
that you want to ask a question but you think

86
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,870
you know
the answer already, then the question tag

87
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,419
should be the opposite of the main verb.

88
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:51,270
That means, if the main verb is positive,
the tag should be negative; if the main verb

89
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,940
is negative, the tag should be positive.

90
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,440
So, ‘you do yoga, don’t you?’

91
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,160
means that I think you do yoga, and I’m
asking to confirm my idea.

92
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,580
Use a positive sentence plus a positive question
tag to show interest.

93
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,260
‘You do taekwondo, do you?’

94
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,560
looks like a question, but it isn’t really
a question.

95
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,410
It shows politeness and interest in the person
you’re talking to.

96
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,330
This form is common when making small talk.

97
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:34,330
You can also make negative questions, starting
with ‘don’t’, ‘doesn’t’, or ‘didn’t’.

98
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,420
You use these to express surprise or frustration.

99
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,820
Question four is an example of this.

100
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,680
Like number five, this isn’t a real question.

101
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,789
You use it to express an emotion.

102
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:56,139
When you use negative questions, intonation
is important: ‘Didn’t you do the dishes?’

103
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:02,370
Let’s move on to level three.

104
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,310
This time, we’ll do something a little different.

105
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,919
Each of these five sentences contains a mistake.

106
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:16,830
Your job is to find the mistake and correct
it.

107
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,350
Pause the video and do it now.

108
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,850
Think carefully about your answers.

109
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:29,620
Do you need to add a word, remove a word,
or change a word?

110
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,120
Here are the answers.

111
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,040
Sentence one is an *indirect* question.

112
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:42,229
An indirect question starts with a polite
phrase like ‘Can you tell me…’ or ‘Do

113
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,909
you know…’

114
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:49,300
You use indirect questions when you want to
sound more polite.

115
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:57,020
Indirect questions *don’t* use ‘do’,
‘does’ and so on as an auxiliary verb.

116
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,820
This is a common mistake.

117
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:07,030
In question two, you need to use ‘does’
as an auxiliary verb to refer to another verb

118
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:11,300
– ‘like’ – which you used earlier.

119
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:17,880
In most cases, the auxiliary verb you need
depends on the verb tense, *not* on the original

120
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,880
verb.

121
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,240
The exception is verbs like ‘be’, ‘can’
and so on, which can be their own auxiliary

122
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,339
verbs.

123
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:34,630
Here, the verb ‘like’ is present simple,
so it uses the auxiliary verb do/does.

124
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:40,510
In number three, you have a verb – ask – which
needs to be followed by an infinitive with

125
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,850
‘to’.

126
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,000
Here, the infinitive is negative.

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,670
You make negative infinitives by adding ‘not’.

128
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:57,130
You don’t use ‘don’t’, ‘doesn’t’,
or any other form of ‘do.

129
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:03,269
In number four, you need to know something
about how to use ‘do’ and ‘make’.

130
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,760
This is more of a vocabulary point.

131
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,380
In many cases, you need to remember whether
a word – like ‘progress’ – goes with

132
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,200
‘do’ or ‘make’.

133
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,070
Number five is also a vocabulary point.

134
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:23,110
There are many fixed phrases with ‘do’,
like ‘do someone a favour’.

135
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:30,259
After ‘do’, you need a person – ‘do
*me* a favour’, ‘do *you* a favour’

136
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:31,930
– and so on.

137
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:39,950
So, to review, the topics covered in level
three are: indirect questions, ‘do’ as

138
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:46,930
an auxiliary verb, negative infinitives, ‘do’
versus ‘make’, and fixed phrases with

139
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,720
‘do’.

140
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,610
Where were you stronger or weaker?

141
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:57,830
Think about what you know, and what you need
to focus on to improve.

142
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:04,670
Anyway, time for level four!

143
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,870
Here are your sentences for level four.

144
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,670
You need to complete each sentence with two
words.

145
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,529
One word is a form of ‘do’.

146
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:24,760
Remember: you *must* use exactly two words!

147
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,660
Let’s see the answers.

148
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,380
So, what do you need to know here?

149
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,750
In level three, you saw that there are negative
infinitive forms.

150
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,170
There are also negative -ing forms.

151
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:48,709
Like negative infinitives, you just add ‘not’
to make the sentence negative.

152
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,890
You can see this in sentence one.

153
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,260
Number two is a participle clause.

154
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,880
The meaning is similar to: ‘Because I hadn’t
done anything similar before…’

155
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,050
What about three?

156
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,660
Can you explain what’s going on there?

157
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:15,959
Remember that ‘do’ can be both an auxiliary
verb and a main verb, and it can also do both

158
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,029
things in one sentence.

159
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:24,560
Auxiliary verbs can be used to add emphasis;
for example, if you want to contradict what

160
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,700
someone else says.

161
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:35,870
Here, ‘did’ is an auxiliary verb which
adds emphasis, and ‘do’ is a main verb.

162
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:42,959
So, if someone asked you ‘Why didn’t you
do it?’, you might answer like this ‘I

163
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,410
*did* do it.

164
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,520
I just forgot to send it to you!’

165
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:55,200
You use the auxiliary verb – ‘did’ – to
add emphasis and contradict the other person.

166
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,840
Four and five are vocabulary points.

167
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:03,459
‘Do your best’ is a fixed phrase meaning
‘try as hard as you can.’

168
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:09,160
For example, you could say ‘We did our best,
but we didn’t have four of our best players,

169
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,520
so it’s not surprising we lost three-nil.’

170
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,800
‘Do with’ is a conversational way to say
‘want’.

171
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,839
‘I could do with a long holiday’ means
that I really want a long holiday right now!

172
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,920
Remember: you can review any section of this
video as many times as you need.

173
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:37,010
Here’s a tip: a big difficulty with ‘do’
is that it has so many different uses.

174
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:43,420
It can be a main verb, an auxiliary verb,
or it can be used in fixed phrases and phrasal

175
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,540
verbs.

176
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:51,370
So, when you see ‘do’ in a sentence, ask
yourself which thing it is.

177
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:57,320
Is it a main verb, an auxiliary verb, or part
of a longer phrase?

178
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:03,829
Getting this clear will help you to understand
how to use ‘do’ more accurately.

179
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:09,360
Now, are you ready for level five?

180
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,350
Let’s try!

181
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,940
Ready for the hardest challenge?

182
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,550
Here are five of the hardest sentences we
could make.

183
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,310
Your job is to complete them with one or two
words.

184
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:28,380
One of the words must be a form of ‘do’.

185
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,470
Contractions, like ‘don’t’, count as
one word.

186
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,660
Could you do it?

187
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,700
Let’s see the answers.

188
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:45,040
Most of the sentences here test vocabulary
points.

189
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,720
For example, take sentence one.

190
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,940
In conversational English, ‘do’ can have
the meaning of ‘be enough, but not very

191
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,460
good’.

192
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:03,020
If you say ‘it’ll do’, you mean that
it’s not great, but it’s enough for you.

193
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,120
Sentence two tests a grammar point.

194
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,029
Hopefully, you know already that you can use
‘do’ as an auxiliary verb to refer back

195
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:17,370
to a verb or verb phrase you used earlier.

196
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:23,360
If you didn’t use ‘do’ here, you would
have to repeat the full phrase ‘his chances

197
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,520
of working for the EU’, which would be repetitive.

198
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,820
However, here you also need an -ing verb.

199
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:39,570
When you want to use ‘do’ as an auxiliary
verb to replace an earlier verb, *and* you

200
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:47,380
want to use an -ing form, or to plus infinitive,
you should use ‘do so’.

201
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,790
‘Do so’ is formal.

202
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:56,110
In spoken or informal English, you’d probably
say ‘do it’ or ‘do that’.

203
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,149
Three, four and five all test your vocabulary.

204
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:07,860
In three, ‘get it done’ is a conversational
way to say ‘finish something’.

205
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:14,130
In number four, ‘doing well for themselves’
means that they’re making a lot of money,

206
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,840
so they have a comfortable lifestyle.

207
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:24,270
In sentence five, ‘it hasn’t done me much
good’ is a semi-fixed phrase.

208
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:30,220
If you want to make the phrase positive, say
‘it’s done me *a lot of* good’.

209
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:35,110
Of course, you can also use this to talk about
other people.

210
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:39,200
For example ‘She looks so much happier these
days.

211
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:46,340
Switching to part time work seems to have
done her a lot of good.’

212
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,519
So, how did you do?

213
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,630
Which topics did you find the hardest?

214
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:58,160
We think level five is the hardest, because
it tests a lot of fixed and conversational

215
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,670
phrases.

216
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,269
Do you agree?

217
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:05,160
Please share your thoughts in the comments.

218
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,579
That’s all for now.

219
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:08,359
See you next time!
