00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,800
Hi, I’m Liam.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,540
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,020
In this lesson, you can learn to talk about
different emotions in English.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:15,220
You’ll see how to talk about positive and
negative feelings, about strong emotions and

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,750
low-level emotions in different ways.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,169

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,950
This lesson has four parts.

11
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:45,120
In each part, you’ll learn five to six words
related to two different main emotions, like

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,820
anger, fear or happiness.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,020
Ready?

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,920
Let’s start!

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
You look pleased!

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,040
What’s going on?

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,990
I finally passed my driving test!

18
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,100
I’m so happy!

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,100
Wow!

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,100
Congratulations!

21
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,100
Thanks…

22
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,510
It was my sixth attempt!

23
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,510
Sixth?

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,510
Yeah.

25
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,090
I was really stressed beforehand.

26
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,270
I’ve been feeling nervous for days, and
I haven’t been sleeping well, but in the

27
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,640
end it went well.

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,999
That sounds stressful.

29
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:14,869
What made you so scared?

30
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:18,329
I mean, it’s not the end of the world to
fail your driving test.

31
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:19,650
I don’t know.

32
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,249
I just built it up in my head, and it became
this huge thing.

33
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:27,390
I honestly can’t remember feeling so worried
about anything in my life before.

34
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,210
You must be relieved to get it over with.

35
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,619
For sure.

36
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:33,820
If I’d failed again, I think I’d have
just given up.

37
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,780
Well, no need to think about that now!

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,120
Look at six words to describe feelings which
you heard in the dialogue.

39
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,060
First, a question: three of these words relate
to feeling *fear*.

40
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,840
Which three?

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,159
‘Nervous’, ‘worried’ and ‘scared’
are all feelings of fear.

42
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,420
Do you know how they’re different?

43
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,750
‘Nervous’ and ‘worried’ are both low-level
fear.

44
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,100
‘Scared’ describes a more intense feeling.

45
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,920
To describe extreme levels of fear, for example
if you’re in a life-threatening situation,

46
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,740
you could use adjectives like ‘terrified’
or ‘petrified’.

47
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,970
What about the other three adjectives – ‘pleased’,
‘stressed’ and ‘relieved’?

48
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,260
One is different from the other two – which
one?

49
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,860
‘Stressed’ is different, because it’s
an unpleasant emotion.

50
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,650
‘Pleased’ is similar to ‘happy’, but
‘pleased’ is a reaction to a situation.

51
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,220
What does this mean?

52
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:45,380
In English, there are many pairs of words
with a similar meaning, but one is used to

53
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:52,180
describe a general state, while the other
is used to describe a reaction to a specific

54
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,269
situation.

55
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:57,110
‘Happy’ and ‘pleased’ are an example
of this.

56
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,629
So, you can be ‘happy’ generally, or for
long periods of time.

57
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:05,580
You could say: ‘She was happy throughout
her retirement.’

58
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,980
However, ‘pleased’ can’t be used like
this.

59
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,190
You feel pleased at one specific time.

60
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,940
For example: ‘I was pleased with how my
painting turned out.’

61
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,599
Here, you could also use ‘happy’.

62
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,069
‘Happy’ can replace ‘pleased’, but
not the other way round.

63
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:31,829
There are other pairs like this; for example:
‘sad - upset’ or ‘angry - cross’.

64
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:36,459
The first word has a general meaning, and
the second describes your reaction to something

65
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,380
specific.

66
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,890
Finally, what about ‘relieved’?

67
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,609
What does that mean?

68
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:49,460
You feel relieved when you’re free from
pressure or stress.

69
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:54,500
If you have a problem, and the problem is
solved, you might feel relieved.

70
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,310
Or, if you have an exam, and you think you
might fail, you’ll feel relieved when you

71
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,840
pass.

72
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,780
Let’s look at our next section.

73
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,440
In this section, we have a challenge for you.

74
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,599
You’ll hear a dialogue, as usual.

75
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,660
There are six words relating to emotions in
the dialogue.

76
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,060
Listen and try to write them down.

77
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,440
How’s work going?

78
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,340
Urgh…

79
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,320
Don’t ask.

80
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,540
Going well, then?

81
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,840
Don’t even joke about it.

82
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,870
I feel miserable.

83
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,970
I dread going in every morning, and every
day feels like an eternity.

84
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,060
Yeah, you seem a bit down.

85
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,550
But, a couple of months ago you said things
were going OK?

86
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,550
They were.

87
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,060
Or, I thought they were.

88
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,199
That’s the problem – I’m so mixed up!

89
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,220
Working in the fashion industry was always
my dream, and I worked so hard to get an opportunity.

90
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,410
But then, reality started to bite.

91
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,699
What do you think went wrong?

92
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,240
I’m supposed to be an event manager, but
they don’t actually let me make any decisions.

93
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,830
I spend all day doing menial work.

94
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,539
We had a team meeting last week, and they
asked me to go out and get coffee!

95
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,810
I felt so humiliated.

96
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,240
So, what are you going to do?

97
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,139
You can’t stay there, surely…

98
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,000
I don’t know.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,440
I’m torn.

100
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,980
On the one hand, you’re right – I can’t
stay there.

101
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,850
But on the other hand, what am I going to
do?

102
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,260
I was out of work for three months, and I
need the money right now.

103
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,180
It’s a tricky situation.

104
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,490
The worst thing is that it’s affecting everything
else in my life, too.

105
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,100
I don’t go out or do anything after work
or at weekends.

106
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,480
I just feel kind of apathetic; I don’t have
the energy to go anywhere.

107
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,140
Well, I don’t know, but it doesn’t sound
like you can go on like this.

108
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,940
Did you get the six words?

109
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,280
If you want, you can go back and listen again.

110
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,800
Here are the six words you heard.

111
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,410
These words relate to feelings of sadness,
shame and confusion.

112
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,780
Can you put the words into three groups?

113
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,890
‘Miserable’ and ‘down’ are both feelings
of sadness.

114
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:08,840
‘Miserable’ is a strong word, which describes
a deep unhappiness.

115
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,380
‘Down’ is often used when you’re going
through a difficult time in your life, and

116
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,040
you feel unhappy generally.

117
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,080
‘Apathetic’ is also a feeling of sadness,
although it’s a little different.

118
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,789
If you feel apathetic, you don’t care about
anything or have any interest in things.

119
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:31,569
Feeling apathetic means you don’t have much
energy, and it’s difficult to motivate yourself

120
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,920
to do anything.

121
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:40,310
Be careful not to mix up ‘apathetic’ and
‘pathetic’ – they sound similar, but

122
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,539
the meanings are not related.

123
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:47,760
Next, ‘mixed up’ and ‘torn’ are both
feelings of confusion.

124
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,270
They both mean that you’re caught between
different possibilities, and you don’t know

125
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,979
what to do.

126
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:59,240
To remember the word ‘torn’, think about
the verb ‘tear’.

127
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,349
If you tear a piece of paper, you rip it into
pieces.

128
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:08,860
If you feel ‘torn’, it’s as if you’re
being pulled in two different directions.

129
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,900
‘Humiliated’ is a strong form of ‘embarrassed’,
meaning a deep feeling of shame.

130
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:21,350
It has a strong meaning, so you wouldn’t
use it often.

131
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,600
Any plans for this weekend?

132
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,139
No, not really.

133
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,700
I had something, but it didn’t work out.

134
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,960
‘Something?’

135
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,660
Well…

136
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,080
I’m a little embarrassed to say…

137
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,879
OK, fine, I had a blind date arranged.

138
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,659
Nothing wrong with that!

139
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,270
But now it’s not happening?

140
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,240
No, I cancelled it.

141
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,860
I was feeling quite anxious.

142
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,169
I’ve never been on a blind date, and I imagine
it would be really awkward, so I called it

143
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:47,169
off.

144
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:49,819
Sure, I guess it could be, but it could be
fun, too.

145
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:51,129
I think you should go!

146
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:54,460
It’s normal to feel apprehensive before
you go on a first date.

147
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,370
You shouldn’t let it stop you.

148
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,370
Hmm…

149
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,060
Too late now, though.

150
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,919
I already cancelled it.

151
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:02,699
Now I'm kind of regretting it.

152
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,939
Well, maybe you can still make it happen.

153
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:06,630
Why not make a call?

154
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,630
Ehh…

155
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,910
I can’t.

156
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,919
I feel guilty for cancelling.

157
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,990
You can’t win, it seems!

158
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,060
You heard five words related to feelings.

159
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,860
Can you remember them?

160
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,100
Try to complete the words!

161
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,200
Pause the video if you want more time.

162
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,020
Remember that you can also go back and review
the dialogue if you want to.

163
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,980
Ready?

164
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,700
Let’s see the answers.

165
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,960
These words relate to shame and nervousness.

166
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,340
Can you put them into two groups?

167
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,540
‘Anxious’ and ‘apprehensive’ describe
fear.

168
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,870
Like the words ‘nervous’ and ‘worried’,
which you saw earlier, they express a low-level

169
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:58,840
fear, like you might feel before a first date
or an important exam.

170
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,120
‘Awkward’, ‘embarrassed’ and ‘guilty’
relate to shame, but they don’t have the

171
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,680
same meaning.

172
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,330
Could you explain the difference between them?

173
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,050
‘Awkward’ means you feel socially uncomfortable.

174
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,089
For example, if you’re trying to start a
conversation with someone, but you don’t

175
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,740
know what to say, you might feel awkward.

176
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:25,790
‘Embarrassed’ is the feeling when you
blush – your face turns red.

177
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,649
You feel ‘guilty’ when you think you’ve
done something bad.

178
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:35,570
For example, imagine that your friend asks
you for some help, and you say: “Sorry,

179
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,100
I can’t, I’m too busy.”

180
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:45,680
Later, you learn that your friend really needed
help; you might feel guilty for not helping.

181
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,480
Let’s look at the last section.

182
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,600
Whoa, where are you going?

183
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,850
I’m going to walk into his office and tell
him exactly what I think of him.

184
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,860
That’s not a good idea.

185
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,800
I know you’re annoyed…

186
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Annoyed?

187
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,780
I’m seething!

188
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,680
I’m fed up with this place.

189
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,240
Let him sack me if he wants.

190
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,880
Let’s just take a minute.

191
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Why don’t you tell me what happened?

192
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,240
What happened?

193
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,740
This isn’t something new.

194
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,700
I’ve been overwhelmed for weeks.

195
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,260
I ask for help, and he doesn’t even answer
my emails or my messages.

196
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:22,390
He’s supposed to be in charge of this department,
and he’s not even doing his job.

197
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,120
Sure, I can understand that you’re frustrated,
but…

198
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,690
It’s more than that.

199
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,810
He still hasn’t bought the design software
we need.

200
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,339
The deadline is next week.

201
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,490
I’ve never seen such incompetence.

202
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,209
Look, I would be upset too, in your position,
but getting into a shouting match with him

203
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:41,640
is not going to solve anything.

204
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,660
How about this: we go and have a cup of tea
for ten minutes, and then you decide what

205
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,660
to do?

206
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:53,440
If you still want to march into his office
and scream at him, I won’t stop you, but

207
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,520
just take ten minutes with me first.

208
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,420
OK, fine.

209
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,980
Here, you heard six words related to anger,
frustration or sadness.

210
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:08,260
Here’s a question: what does ‘frustration’
mean?

211
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:13,420
Frustration is a kind of anger, but it relates
to situations where you can’t get what you

212
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,710
want.

213
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,970
For example, imagine you have to catch a train,
and you’re late.

214
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:25,400
You’re driving to the station, and someone
in front of you is driving *really* slowly.

215
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,170
You can’t overtake, so you’re stuck driving
behind them.

216
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:34,230
You might feel frustrated in this situation.

217
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:39,700
Apart from ‘frustrated’, you heard these
words in the dialogue.

218
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,860
Do you know which emotions these words express?

219
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,280
And, could you explain their meanings in detail?

220
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,980
Think about it, and pause the video if you
need some help!

221
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,839
‘Annoyed’ and ‘seething’ both express
anger, but at different levels.

222
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:59,829
‘Annoyed’ is a low-level anger.

223
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:05,300
For example, if you have some mosquito bites,
and they’re itchy, you might feel a little

224
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,040
annoyed, but you wouldn’t – probably – be
fully angry.

225
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,400
You could also say ‘irritated’, which
has the same meaning.

226
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,380
‘Seething’ means extremely angry.

227
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,820
You could also say ‘furious’, which is
similar.

228
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,420
‘Fed up’ expresses frustration.

229
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,560
If you’re fed up with something, a bad situation
has gone on for a long time, and you can’t

230
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,140
take it any more.

231
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,760
For example, if your neighbour plays loud
music one evening, you might be annoyed, but

232
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,640
maybe it wouldn’t be a big problem.

233
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:47,250
However, if your neighbour plays loud music
*every* evening, you’ll feel angry and frustrated,

234
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:52,760
and after a few days you’ll probably feel
fed up; you’ve had enough of the situation

235
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,460
and you cannot take any more.

236
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,220
‘Overwhelmed’ is hard to classify.

237
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,900
Overwhelmed means something like ‘defeated’
or ‘buried’.

238
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,660
If you’re overwhelmed, you have so many
problems and negative feelings that you can’t

239
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,360
cope any more.

240
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,170
In the dialogue, we were talking about work,
but you can be overwhelmed with other emotions

241
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,459
and situations, too.

242
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:21,610
For example, you can be overwhelmed with anger,
overwhelmed with sadness, overwhelmed with

243
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,980
stress, and so on.

244
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:31,720
It can even, sometimes, be positive; for example
you can be overwhelmed with happiness.

245
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,200
In this case, it means that you’re so happy
that you don’t know what to do with yourself.

246
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:45,080
Finally, ‘upset’ is a feeling of sadness
in response to a specific situation.

247
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:49,850
If something bad happens to you, or someone
says something unpleasant to you, you might

248
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,700
feel upset.

249
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:58,610
We’ve mentioned many different words to
describe feelings in this video, but there

250
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,800
are also many that we didn’t talk about.

251
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,920
Can you think of any?

252
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,589
Share your ideas in the comments!

253
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:06,889
Thanks for watching!

254
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,620
See you next time!
