00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,980
Hi, I'm Mike.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,279
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:11,990
In this lesson, you can learn how to write
an email in English.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,570
Do you need to write emails at work?

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,590
Are you worried that your emails aren’t
clear, or that you make mistakes in English?

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:26,920
In this lesson, you can see a how to write
clear, natural-sounding emails easily and

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,240
quickly.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:35,710
We’ll show you how to write an email in
English from beginning to end, in simple,

9
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,350
clear steps that you can follow right now!

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,660
Let’s start at the beginning.

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,080
With emails, you can start like a letter.

12
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,559
For example:

13
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:56,450
Dear Lina,
Dear Sir/Madam,

14
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,739
Dear Mr Hill,

15
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,800
However, emails are generally much less formal
than letters.

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,780
Use a greeting with 'dear' only if you’re
writing something formal.

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,300
So, what else can you use?

18
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,320
Many emails start with hello, or hi plus the
person’s name.

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,230
For example,

20
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,750
Hello,
Hi Ryan,

21
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,600
In many business emails, you’ll follow the
greeting with something like:

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,920
I hope you’re well.

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,630
or
How are you?

24
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:43,860
In business emails, these are simply polite
phrases, and they don’t generally need an

25
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,900
answer.

26
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,700
For more informal emails, you can start with
just the word hi or hey, plus a comma:

27
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,460
You can also just write the person’s name
plus a comma.

28
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,930
This is a more professional style, even though
it’s more informal.

29
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,780
It’s best with people you already know.

30
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,770
For a very informal email, you might not need
a greeting at all.

31
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,950
This is also true if you’re sending several
emails to the same person in a short time:

32
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,260
you don’t need to write a greeting every
time.

33
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,600
Let’s review quickly:

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:34,280
For very formal emails, use a greeting with
dear plus a name, like a letter.

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:42,170
For most everyday emails, use either hello
or hi plus a name.

36
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:49,570
For less formal emails, use hi or hey without
a name, or don’t use a greeting at all.

37
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,440
Okay, but what next?

38
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,600
After your greeting, you should explain why
you’re writing.

39
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,420
Make this as short as possible.

40
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,970
If you’re writing to someone who receives
hundreds of emails every day, you need to

41
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,319
make your purpose clear quickly.

42
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,150
Someone who’s very busy won’t spend a
lot of time trying to work out what you’re

43
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,020
trying to say!

44
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,550
How can you do this?

45
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,050
Start with a simple phrase, like:

46
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,000
I’m writing regarding…

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,110
I wanted to follow up on…

48
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,800
I would like to ask about…

49
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,600
These phrases are slightly more formal.

50
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,500
Let’s see how you could use them:

51
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:50,090
I’m writing regarding the issues we’ve
been having with our database system.

52
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:57,710
I wanted to follow up on our meeting last
week and confirm our plans for this month.

53
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:05,160
I would like to ask about the new budget and
whether this will affect our department.

54
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,420
In a more informal email, you wouldn’t use
a phrase like this.

55
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:16,010
You might ask a more direct question or make
a direct statement, like this:

56
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,090
Do you know when the database issues will
be fixed?

57
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:26,200
Let’s confirm our plans for this month.

58
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,720
How will the new budget affect our department?

59
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,160
If you’re writing because you want to find
a solution to a problem, here are some useful

60
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,200
phrases:

61
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:46,640
I’m concerned about… or
I need to bring something to your attention.

62
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,680
Again, these are more formal phrases.

63
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,530
Let’s see how you can use them:

64
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:00,690
I’m concerned about the number of sick days
staff have been taking recently.

65
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:07,320
I need to bring something to your attention:
using outdated software puts us at risk of

66
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,460
malware infections and data loss.

67
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,300
Now it’s your turn.

68
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,720
Imagine that you’re writing an email to
your manager, colleague, or client.

69
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,740
You need to write an appropriate greeting,
then write one or two sentences to explain

70
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,970
why you’re writing.

71
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,320
Pause the video and do it now!

72
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,770
Start again when you’ve finished.

73
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,460
Ready?

74
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,540
Let’s move on.

75
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:50,920
After you introduce why you’re writing,
you need to add more details and supporting information,

76
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,490
so that your reader understands the situation
you’re describing.

77
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,479
Put this information in a new paragraph.

78
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,080
This will make your email clear and easy to
follow.

79
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:15,560
First, ask yourself what the person you’re
writing to needs to know.

80
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,770
With emails, less is more.

81
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,460
No one wants to read a very long email, and
it’s hard to make yourself clear if you

82
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,650
write too much.

83
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:30,180
So, try to limit yourself to two to three
sentences.

84
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,460
Put your most important point first.

85
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,750
Let’s look at some examples:

86
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:42,990
I’m writing regarding the issues we’ve
been having with our database

87
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,449
Both clients and staff have been experiencing
severe problems for several days now.

88
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:56,870
We are unable to update records or access
information on customer interactions.

89
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:04,139
This is costing us large amounts of money,
both in time spent trying to fix the problem,

90
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,330
and in lost sales.

91
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,070
Here’s one more:

92
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:16,000
I’m concerned about the number of sick days
staff have been taking recently.

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,940
Staff in the IT department have taken a total
of 44 sick days so far this month, compared

94
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,960
to a total of 23 for last month, and just
18 for the previous month.

95
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:36,150
This is affecting productivity, and also placing
a lot of stress on the employees who do come

96
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,880
to work.

97
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,720
In both cases, you’re writing to describe
a problem.

98
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:51,400
Your first sentence introduces the problem,
and then your next paragraph gives more details.

99
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:58,870
You can see that in both examples, we use
just two sentences, but you can include a

100
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,449
lot of useful information in two sentences.

101
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:10,810
If you have more than one point to make in
your email, you can repeat this pattern: first

102
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:18,960
put a short sentence to introduce your point,
then add a paragraph with two to three sentences

103
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,280
to add details.

104
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,370
You can move from one point to another using
a phrase like:

105
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,590
There’s one more thing I’d like to discuss
with you.

106
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,380
Regarding…

107
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,959
I’d also like to ask you about…

108
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,939
Use one of these phrases to change the topic,
and then introduce your next point.

109
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:47,139
For example:

110
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:51,970
There’s one more thing I’d like to discuss
with you.

111
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:58,389
It seems like the number of customer complaints
has been increasing for three months…

112
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:02,459
Now, you can practice.

113
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,410
Take the email you started before.

114
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:11,180
Add a new paragraph, which should be two to
three sentences long.

115
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,990
Add details to the point you introduced before.

116
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,629
Pause the video and do it now.

117
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:25,360
If you want extra practice, add another topic
to your email, using one of the linking phrases

118
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,769
you just saw.

119
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:32,540
After you explain all the points you want
to make, what should you do next?

120
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:42,620
When you write an email, you should make it
clear what you expect from the person you’re

121
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,199
sending it to.

122
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:49,970
Even if you’re writing just to give the
other person some information, it’s a good

123
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,529
idea to make that clear.

124
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:56,420
Put your call to action in a new paragraph.

125
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:03,680
Again, putting each thing in its own paragraph
makes your email structured and easy to follow.

126
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,850
So, what can you write here?

127
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:15,949
First, let’s consider situations where you
need the other person to do something urgently.

128
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,420
You could say:

129
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,499
Please … by tomorrow at the latest.

130
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:26,959
As a matter of urgency, you need to…

131
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,160
For example:

132
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,540
Please arrange a meeting of all department
heads by tomorrow at the latest.

133
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,759
As a matter of urgency, you need to contact
all the clients who may have been affected

134
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:45,000
by this data breach.

135
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,699
If your request is less urgent, you could
use phrases such as:

136
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:53,930
Could you please…?

137
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,369
I would like you to…

138
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:59,749
For example:

139
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:05,989
Could you please talk to Matt in the HR department
and clarify our options on this?

140
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:11,639
I would like you to design a poster to inform
staff about the new policies.

141
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:18,360
With calls to action, you should think about
your relationship with the person you’re

142
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,060
writing to.

143
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:29,790
For example, saying something like, you need
to… or I would like you to… is relatively

144
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,180
direct.

145
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:39,709
That’s fine if you’re a manager writing
to one of your team, but it might sound inappropriate

146
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:43,329
if you write that to your manager.

147
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:47,120
This also depends on the corporate culture
where you work.

148
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:54,019
Generally, if you aren’t sure, it’s better
to be less direct.

149
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,199
For example:

150
00:11:55,199 --> 00:12:00,540
I suggest that you contact all clients who
may have been affected by the data breach.

151
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:07,540
Can I ask you to design a poster to inform
staff about the new policies?

152
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,500
But, be careful!

153
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:18,320
Don’t be so indirect that the other person
doesn’t understand what you need.

154
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,949
If you don’t need a response from the other
person, say something like:

155
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:28,260
This is just to keep you updated.

156
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:35,139
This doesn’t require any immediate response,
but please keep an eye on the situation.

157
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:38,269
Now, it’s your turn!

158
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:44,990
Pause the video and add a call to action to
the end of your email.

159
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:50,500
Think about who you’re writing to, and make
your call-to-action appropriately direct or

160
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,379
indirect.

161
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,820
So, now you’re nearly finished.

162
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,520
What’s left?

163
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,379
Finish your email with a sign-off and your
name.

164
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:12,509
You can use a lot of the same sign-offs you
can use in a paper letter, such as:

165
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:16,350
Regards,
Best Wishes,

166
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,910
Kind Regards,

167
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:24,179
Like with greetings, you wouldn’t generally
use very formal sign-offs like Yours Sincerely

168
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,709
in an email.

169
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:30,759
You might see it sometimes, but only in very
formal emails.

170
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:35,649
Don’t forget to write each word of your
sign-off with a capital letter, and put a

171
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,279
comma at the end.

172
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:44,759
The sign-offs you’ve just seen are neutral
and can be used in almost any situation.

173
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:53,029
If you’re writing something more informal,
you might use a sign-off like:

174
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:56,029
Cheers,
Take care,

175
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:02,889
In this case, you wouldn’t capitalise each
word, which is why care in take care has a

176
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:05,970
small ‘c’.

177
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:11,509
Like with greetings, you might not need a
sign-off at all in an informal email.

178
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:16,720
Just write your name at the bottom, or don’t
write anything at all!

179
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,020
After you put your sign-off, add your name,
and you’ve finished!

180
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,880
For example,

181
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,100
Regards,

182
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,880
Vijay

183
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,980
Cheers,

184
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,840
Katya

185
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:36,499
Now you know how to write a clear, effective
email in English.

186
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,180
Let’s put everything you’ve learned together.

187
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:50,000
To write an effective email in English, you
need to:

188
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,080
1. Use an appropriate greeting.

189
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,380
2. Introduce your topic in a single sentence.

190
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:03,720
3. Add details to your topic in a short paragraph.

191
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,460
4. Add a call-to-action to explain what you need
the other person to do.

192
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,240
5. Use an appropriate signoff.

193
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,400
Let’s do a longer example together:

194
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,410
Dear Lina,

195
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:25,439
I need to bring something to your attention:
many staff are using very weak passwords on

196
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,899
their laptops and for database access.

197
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:36,509
Our work depends on keeping our clients’
personal financial information safe.

198
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:42,910
If we lose our clients’ trust on this issue,
it will not be easy to recover.

199
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:49,619
I trust that you can see that it is better
to take action now, rather than after something

200
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:51,730
goes wrong.

201
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:58,869
I suggest we make a rule that passwords must
be a specific length, and that staff must

202
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:03,689
change their passwords at least once a month.

203
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:07,819
Please let me know what you think about this.

204
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:10,069
Regards,

205
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,319
Vijay

206
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:16,759
What do you think: could you write an email
like this?

207
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,329
Try it!

208
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:21,559
Use words and phrases from the lesson.

209
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:27,549
Remember to organise your email into paragraphs,
like we showed you.

210
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:33,760
This will make it easier to keep your ideas
structured and clear.
