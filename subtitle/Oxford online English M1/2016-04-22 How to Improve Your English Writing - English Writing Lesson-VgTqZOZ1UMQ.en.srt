00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:02,930
Hello.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:03,930
I'm Oli.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,670
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,600
In this lesson, you can learn about how to
improve your English writing.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,580
Learning to write well is often the most difficult
skill for English learners.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,370
Writing well requires great control of language
and extreme attention to detail.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,320
Even then, it's not easy, even for native
speakers.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,440
In this video, you can see some advice that
will help you to improve your English writing,

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,890
whatever level your English is now.

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,190
First, understand your audience.

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,899
Before you start writing, you need to answer
two questions.

12
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:48,140
Question one: who are you writing for?

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:59,219
Are you writing for your friend, your colleague,
your teacher, your manager, an examiner, who?

14
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,010
Secondly, what are you trying to achieve?

15
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,610
Are you trying to give someone information?

16
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,960
Are you trying to convince somebody of your
point of view?

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,690
Are you trying to entertain somebody and make
them laugh?

18
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:23,430
Are you just trying to pass an exam, or are
you trying to achieve several different things?

19
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:29,590
Thinking about your purpose in writing can
really help you to organize your ideas.

20
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,340
Now these questions: who are you writing for,
and what do you want to achieve, they are

21
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,479
important.

22
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:41,600
But there's an even more important question:
what does your reader want?

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,740
Remember, when you write, you're normally
writing for someone else, unless you're writing

24
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,650
a diary or a journal for yourself, in which
case you can write however you want.

25
00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:00,579
Normally, however, you're writing for another
person.

26
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:06,350
Whoever reads your writing will give their
time and their attention to read what you've

27
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,900
written.

28
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,450
Why?

29
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,329
Why will someone give their time to read what
you've written?

30
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:19,919
Okay, so for example, if you're writing an
essay at school or at university for your

31
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,749
teacher, your teacher will spend time reading
your essay to see if you've understood the

32
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:28,269
topic or not.

33
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:34,459
If you're writing an email or a letter to
a friend, your friend will probably want to

34
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:39,830
hear some news about your life and maybe hear
some funny stories.

35
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:46,049
If you're writing in an exam, the examiner
will be looking for some specific things which

36
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:53,170
you do or don't do in your writing in order
to decide your score.

37
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:58,480
Understanding your reader, or your readers,
and understanding what they want from your

38
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,290
writing is essential.

39
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:07,319
You need to think about this from the beginning
to the end of the writing process.

40
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,250
So are you ready to start writing yet?

41
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,890
Not quite.

42
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,559
Next, you need to plan your writing.

43
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:21,989
If you don't plan your writing, there's a
good chance you will miss out some important

44
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:28,799
ideas, you won't include them in your writing,
or you might include some unnecessary ideas

45
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,159
that will confuse your reader and make your
purpose unclear.

46
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,819
Have you ever written something and got stuck
in the middle?

47
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:42,599
You start a paragraph, or you start a sentence,
and in the middle you stop and you think,

48
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,029
"What am I doing?

49
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:46,060
Where am I going?

50
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,749
What do I say next?

51
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:49,040
Uh, help!"

52
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,810
Why does this happen?

53
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,619
Often it happens because you haven't planned
enough.

54
00:03:55,619 --> 00:04:00,579
Imagine that you're in a new city and you're
trying to find your way somewhere.

55
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:05,699
You don't have a map, you don't have a smartphone,
there's nobody you can ask.

56
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:07,769
Of course, you'll get lost.

57
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,409
You'll go down streets without knowing where
they go.

58
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:13,510
You'll go around in circles.

59
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:19,500
If you do find the place you were looking
for, it will just be because you were lucky.

60
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,250
Writing without planning is very similar.

61
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,720
You'll start sentences or paragraphs without
knowing where they're going.

62
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,251
You'll waste lots of time writing things,
deleting them, rewriting them, deleting them,

63
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:34,080
writing them again.

64
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,650
If you do achieve your goal, it will only
be because you were lucky.

65
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:44,520
Remember, you're writing for someone else,
and you're writing for a reason.

66
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,650
That means you have a goal, even if it's a
simple goal.

67
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,939
You need to have a plan of how you're going
to reach that goal.

68
00:04:53,939 --> 00:05:00,710
That means you need to think about these questions:
what are you going to include?

69
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,440
What are you going to leave out?

70
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,070
And, how are you going to organize your ideas?

71
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,789
If you're writing something simple, you might
just think for a minute or two about what

72
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:13,110
to say.

73
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,710
If you're writing something longer and more
complex like a long essay, you might need

74
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,650
to make a written plan.

75
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,780
So what points should you include and what
points should you leave out?

76
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,080
Well, that's a general question.

77
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,259
If you're not sure, think about your goal
and your reader's needs.

78
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:37,129
Ask yourself, "Does my reader need to know
this?

79
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:40,199
Will my reader want to know this?

80
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,770
Does including this point, or including this
idea, help me to reach my goal?"

81
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,360
Thinking about these questions will help you
to decide what to include in your writing

82
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,219
and what to leave out.

83
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:59,229
What about the third question: how are you
going to organize your ideas?

84
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:00,389
Let's look.

85
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,580
You need to organize your ideas into clear
paragraphs.

86
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:10,710
Organizing your ideas into paragraphs is important
for many reasons.

87
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,240
It helps your reader understand what your
main points are.

88
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,629
It helps your reader see where you're going
and why, and it helps you to stay focused

89
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,470
on your plan and reaching your goal.

90
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:28,710
So what does it mean in practice to organize
your ideas into clear paragraphs?

91
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,479
Firstly, each paragraph should have one main
idea.

92
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:39,490
If you're writing an essay and you have a
list of points to include, put one point in

93
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,229
each paragraph.

94
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:46,880
Even if you're writing something shorter or
simpler, you still need to organize your ideas

95
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,850
into paragraphs.

96
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,520
Don't try to do too much.

97
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,889
Your writing will be much clearer and much
easier to read if each paragraph is only trying

98
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,530
to do one thing.

99
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:03,060
An extra point: there's no minimum or maximum
length for a paragraph.

100
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,729
Sometimes when I teach students writing, they
try to make paragraphs longer because they

101
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:09,650
say, "Oh, this paragraph is too short.

102
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,539
It needs more words, it needs more sentences."

103
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:17,130
No, a paragraph should be as long as it needs
to be to make your point.

104
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,509
There's no minimum length.

105
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:24,590
Next, you need to decide how many paragraphs
you're going to have and what you're going

106
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,639
to put in each one.

107
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,360
Remember, this is still part of planning.

108
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,430
We haven't even written a single word yet.

109
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,569
Again, you could do this planning in your
head, or you could make some short notes,

110
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:40,389
or you could make a more detailed written
plan.

111
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:46,999
It depends how much time you have, what you're
trying to write, and how important it is.

112
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:52,810
But the important point is when you start
writing, you won't have to think about questions

113
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,040
like, "What do I put in this paragraph?

114
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,240
How many more paragraphs do I need?

115
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,659
How am I going to finish this sentence?

116
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:04,310
You will have thought about all of these things
already.

117
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:09,879
This will make it much easier to write whatever
you're trying to write.

118
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:13,789
Okay, so now you're ready to start writing.

119
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:15,599
What next?

120
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:21,250
Part four: cut empty words and sentences.

121
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:27,110
There's a simple rule you can use to make
your English writing better and clearer: write

122
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,139
as little as possible.

123
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:32,440
Let's look at some examples.

124
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,180
First, don't use two words if you can use
one word.

125
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,250
Don't use three words if you can use two words.

126
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,930
For example, don't say "very tired," say,
"exhausted."

127
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,430
"Very" is generally a weak word, and it should
be avoided.

128
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,029
It doesn't add much to your meaning.

129
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:55,480
The same is true for words like "really" or
"absolutely."

130
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,540
Use these words as little as possible.

131
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,240
They're very rarely necessary.

132
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,889
Don't say "as a result" if you can say "consequently."

133
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:08,320
Don't say "on the other hand" if you can say
"nevertheless."

134
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,490
Use fewer words.

135
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:16,880
Don't say, "This will get better in the future,"
say, "This will improve in the future."

136
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,870
Don't say, "She gave me a lot of help," say,
"She helped me a lot," or even, "She helped

137
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:30,430
me greatly," or just cut "greatly" and say,
"She helped me," if you can.

138
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,589
Use fewer words.

139
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't say, "Maybe this will solve the problem,"
say, "This will solve the problem."

140
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,070
Words like "maybe" or "perhaps" are generally
not necessary.

141
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:48,370
If you're not sure about something, do you
really need to include it?

142
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:53,680
If you do want to include something that you're
not sure about, use verbs like "might" or

143
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
"could."

144
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,880
Say, "This might solve the problem."

145
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,470
Don't say, "We need to find someone who can
teach our son," say, "We need to find a teacher

146
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,920
for our son."

147
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,290
Cut unnecessary words and use as few words
as possible.

148
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,550
You can also look at sentences.

149
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:20,850
In essays, many people tend to include sentences
like, "There are many advantages and disadvantages

150
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,630
to this.

151
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,860
Of course, there are two sides to this issue.

152
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:30,630
In this essay, I will discuss all the ideas
relevant to this point."

153
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,589
What do these sentences tell you?

154
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:37,680
Do they give you any useful or relevant information?

155
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,880
No, and so they should be cut.

156
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,240
Why is this important?

157
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,550
Well, using fewer words and fewer sentences
will make your writing clearer and easier

158
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,730
to read.

159
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,390
It will also help you to focus on what you
want to say.

160
00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:00,399
Try to look at each sentence you write and
think, "What does this add to my ideas?

161
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,990
What does this give my reader?

162
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,259
How does this help me reach my goal in writing
this?"

163
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:14,480
If you can't answer these questions, consider
cutting it, or try to make it shorter.

164
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,870
It's not easy to write in this way.

165
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:21,399
You won't be able to watch this video and
go away and write like this.

166
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,680
Even in this script, there are probably several
places where I could use my own advice!

167
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,740
However, you can try thinking about it the
next time you write something in English.

168
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,610
Over time you can learn the habit of cutting
empty words and sentences from your writing.

169
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:43,810
Your writing will be much better and much
clearer if you can learn to do this.

170
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:50,399
Next, let's look at some more advice to make
your writing clearer and easier to read.

171
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,910
Use short simple sentences where possible.

172
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,750
Shorter sentences are easier to read and understand.

173
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,839
That's not my opinion, that's a fact.

174
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,440
There's a lot of research behind it.

175
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,750
Longer sentences are harder to read and harder
to understand, generally.

176
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:14,730
If you're a non-native speaker of English,
writing longer sentences is especially dangerous.

177
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,480
There's a higher chance you'll make some grammatical
or language errors which will make your sentence

178
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,800
difficult to read, or even worse, hard to
understand.

179
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,540
How long is too long?

180
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:33,319
Well, 10 words is a good target length, 10
to 20 words is okay.

181
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,970
Longer than 20 words--this is dangerous.

182
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,600
There's a high chance your sentence will become
unclear and difficult to read.

183
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,160
So how can you do this?

184
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,079
Well first, remember what we talked about
before.

185
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,769
Using fewer words will make your sentences
shorter and tighter.

186
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:56,380
Here are some other rules you can use to keep
your sentences shorter and clearer.

187
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,430
First, don't use the passive voice unless
you have a good reason.

188
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,260
Using the passive always makes a sentence
longer and more complex.

189
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:11,240
Now, sometimes it's fine to use the passive,
but not if you don't have a good reason.

190
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,840
If you want to use the passive, make sure
you know why you're using it, and make sure

191
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
it's really necessary.

192
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:22,709
Secondly, start your sentence with the subject
whenever possible.

193
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:30,290
Thirdly, don't use relative clauses, with
who, which, that, where, etc., unless it's

194
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,700
really necessary.

195
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:39,390
When you use a conjunction, like "and" or
"but," or "or," and so on, think, "Do these

196
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,660
two ideas really need to go together?"

197
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,870
If they don't, consider breaking your sentence
into two shorter pieces.

198
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,769
To be clear, long sentences are not automatically
bad.

199
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:58,819
Good writers can produce long sentences which
are clear, and focused, and elegant.

200
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:04,220
If you're writing about a particularly complex
topic, you might need to use longer, more

201
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,730
complex sentences to express more complex
ideas.

202
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:14,370
The point is you should only use a longer,
more complex sentence if it's really necessary.

203
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:20,940
If you can express the same point in a shorter,
simpler sentence, you should.

204
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,529
Let's review what we've talked about today.

205
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:30,399
First, you need to understand who you're writing
for and what they want from your writing.

206
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,360
Secondly, before you start writing, you need
to have a plan.

207
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,509
You need to know what you're going to include,
what you're going to leave out, and how you're

208
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:40,600
going to organize your ideas.

209
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,870
Thirdly, your ideas should always be organized
into clear paragraphs with one main idea per

210
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,130
paragraph.

211
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,399
Fourth, cut unnecessary words and sentences.

212
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,680
And fifth, use shorter, simpler sentences
where you can.

213
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,840
Follow these points, and I guarantee your
writing will get better.

214
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,840
I'm not just saying that.

215
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,870
I use these points when I write something
or edit something, and I see the difference.

216
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,980
Even now, I'm still learning this.

217
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,880
You're never finished.

218
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,870
Follow these points, and you will see a difference.

219
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,100
Okay.

220
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,100
That's the end of the lesson.

221
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,680
