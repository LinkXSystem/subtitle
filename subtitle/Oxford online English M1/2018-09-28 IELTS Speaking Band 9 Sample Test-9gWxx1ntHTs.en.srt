00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,060
Hi, I’m Stephanie.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,580
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,940
In this lesson, you can see a model IELTS
speaking exam with band 9 language.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,680
You’ll see each section of the IELTS speaking
test, and after each section we’ll highlight

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,980
the features that could help you to improve
your IELTS speaking score.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,140
If you’re watching on YouTube, you should
check out the full lesson on our website.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,349
There’s a link underneath the video.

8
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:36,030
The full lesson includes a transcript, so
you can study the answers in your own time.

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:43,420
Let’s start with part one, where I’ll
be the examiner.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,079
Hello, my name is Stephanie.

11
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,239
This is the IELTS speaking test.

12
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,969
Can you tell me your full name, please?

13
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:51,629
My name’s Olivier Guiberteau.

14
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:53,680
And can you tell me where you’re from?

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,780
I’m from a small town near Northampton,
in the UK.

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,079
Can I see your identification, please?

17
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,360
Yes, of course.

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,640
Here you are.

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,320
Okay, thank you very much.

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,330
Now, in this first part I’d like to know
something about you.

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,420
First of all, can you tell me about the kind
of music you like?

22
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,480
Sure, well, I’m a big fan of what you might
call alternative electronica.

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,140
It’s hard to classify, because when you
say ‘electronica’, people think of dance

24
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,130
music, but I wouldn’t call it that.

25
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:30,369
Basically, I listen to a lot of stuff with
hip-hop, funk or disco influences, but most

26
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:33,490
of my friends think my taste in music is a
bit weird.

27
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,610
I see.

28
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,220
And, where do you like to listen to music?

29
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,540
I listen to music pretty much any time that
I’m at home.

30
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,520
So, if I’m doing housework, or cooking,
or anything like that, I’ll put some music

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,120
on.

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,280
Sometimes I also listen to music on the bus.

33
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,230
Especially if I’m going to play sport or
to the gym, I’ll listen to some high-energy

34
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,829
tunes on the way to get myself pumped up.

35
00:01:57,829 --> 00:01:59,320
Yeah, okay.

36
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,540
Why do you think music is so important in
many people’s lives?

37
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,550
Hmm…

38
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,630
That’s a big question…

39
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:11,480
Well, first of all music has always been part
of human culture, so in that sense obviously

40
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,230
it’s an important part of our lives.

41
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,200
I guess that’s because music can have such
a powerful effect on our emotions.

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,580
Music can lift you up, or inspire you, or
make you feel sad.

43
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,560
I’d certainly find it hard to live without
it!

44
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:27,569
Uh-huh.

45
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:30,230
I’d like to move on and talk about transport.

46
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,780
What’s the best way to get around your city?

47
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,450
I live in quite a small town, so it’s very
easy to get around.

48
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,110
You can walk or cycle to a lot of places,
although some roads are a bit dangerous for

49
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,190
bikes.

50
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,000
There are buses which are fairly reliable,
but they’re not the fastest way to get around.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,310
Finally, you can take a taxi or an Uber if
you want to get somewhere fast and you don’t

52
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,260
mind paying a bit extra.

53
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,260
Alright.

54
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,800
And, have you ever learned to drive?

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,960
Yes, I learned in the UK as soon as I was
old enough, although I have to say I haven’t

56
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,590
driven for several years!

57
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,700
I’m not sure if you’d want to get in a
car with me, but I guess I’d pick it up

58
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,040
again quite quickly.

59
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,849
There’s just not much point in having a
car where I am now, because I can walk or

60
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:18,879
ride my bike around town, and take public
transport if I want to go somewhere else,

61
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,040
for the weekend or whatever.

62
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,629
I see.

63
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:25,040
Do you think everybody should learn to drive?

64
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,960
Er…

65
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,980
That’s a strange idea.

66
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,930
I think it’s up to each person to decide.

67
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,970
It can be very useful in some places.

68
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,739
For example, where I grew up in the UK…

69
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:41,290
It’s a rural area, and if you don’t have
a car you’re pretty isolated.

70
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,170
If you live somewhere like that, you should
probably learn to drive.

71
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,040
But, it’s still a choice, right?

72
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,080
Let’s look at some key points from this
part of the speaking exam.

73
00:03:53,080 --> 00:04:01,290
First, to get a high score in IELTS speaking—band
seven or above—you need to speak fluently,

74
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,680
without hesitation.

75
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,480
That doesn’t mean you can never pause or
hesitate, but your hesitations should not

76
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,420
be language-related.

77
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,199
So, if you’re pausing or stopping because
you can’t remember vocabulary, or because

78
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,240
you can’t build a sentence fast enough,
that will make it difficult to get a high

79
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,639
score.

80
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,610
Secondly, Oli’s answers were all relevant
and appropriately developed.

81
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:39,389
He gave full answers to every question and
added extra detail, but he never went off-topic.

82
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:44,930
This is also essential: you need to do both
of these things to get a high score in your

83
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,340
IELTS speaking test.

84
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,410
He also used linking words and connecting
devices well.

85
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,750
Let’s look at one answer as an example:

86
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,960
Notice that I didn’t use a lot of linking
words here.

87
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:05,060
IELTS students often overuse linking words,
and they end up getting a lower score because

88
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,560
they make errors or sound unnatural.

89
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,080
You need to connect your ideas, but you don’t
get a higher score for using more linking

90
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
words.

91
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,740
It’s more important to use linking words
accurately and naturally.

92
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:29,250
Looking at vocabulary, Oli used a wide range
of words and phrases in his answers, including

93
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:38,120
some good collocations like alternative electronica,
disco influences, or a powerful effect on

94
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,699
our emotions.

95
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:46,020
He also used some idiomatic language in a
correct, natural way.

96
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:53,590
For example, I’m a big fan of…, get myself
pumped up, lift you up, or I’d pick it up

97
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,590
again quite quickly.

98
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:02,270
Finally, I got a question at the end which
was harder to answer: Do you think everybody

99
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,630
should learn to drive?

100
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:13,259
You might have to answer some strange questions
in your IELTS speaking exam, or talk about

101
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,430
something you haven’t thought about before.

102
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:23,940
The examiner follows a script, and has no
choice about what to ask you.

103
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,370
Many IELTS candidates have problems because
they try to answer questions they have no

104
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,470
idea about.

105
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,550
In this situation, it’s better to react
naturally.

106
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:43,449
For example, you could say: that’s a weird
question; hmm… that’s a tricky one, or

107
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,330
something like that.

108
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,110
Then, if you have no idea what to say, say
so!

109
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,530
So long as you explain why, this is fine,
and it won’t affect your score.

110
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:01,600
Your score depends on your ability to communicate,
not on your ideas and knowledge.

111
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,290
Let’s look at the next part of the test.

112
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:11,140
We’re going to swap roles here, so I’ll
be the candidate.

113
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:16,880
Now, I’m going to give you a topic and I’d
like you to talk about it for one to two minutes.

114
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:20,199
You have one minute to think about what you
are going to say.

115
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:29,800
You can make some notes to help you if you
wish.

116
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Are you ready?

117
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,190
Yes.

118
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,820
Okay, please tell me about something difficult
you learned to do.

119
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,660
So, I’m going to tell you about learning
to drive a car with manual transmission.

120
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:49,220
I’m from the States, and almost no one drives
a manual there; most cars are automatic.

121
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:54,860
When I came to Europe, I found it was totally
the opposite here; driving a manual is the

122
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,820
norm, and automatics are rare.

123
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,639
I guess here they’re associated with very
expensive, luxury cars.

124
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,640
Anyway, I had to learn to drive stick, and
it was so difficult!

125
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,990
It was doubly hard because I already knew
how to drive, so it felt extra frustrating

126
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,169
to be behind the wheel but unable to do the
things I would normally do.

127
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:22,110
Maybe it wasn’t a good idea but I didn’t
get any help; I could have gone to a driving

128
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,289
school but I didn’t.

129
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:29,520
I just practiced and tried to learn by myself,
by driving around car parks and open spaces

130
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,550
and things like that.

131
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,500
That was okay, but when I went out and drove
properly, on the streets with traffic, it

132
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,599
was super stressful.

133
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,979
I just couldn’t get the clutch right, and
then I’d stall and I’d be stressing out

134
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:45,040
while everyone was honking at me.

135
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,950
I can’t say that I’m glad that I learned
it.

136
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,960
I mean, I just learned to do it because I
had to, and I didn’t enjoy the experience!

137
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,830
If it were up to me, I’d rather just have
an automatic car.

138
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,830
Thank you.

139
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,690
So, what do you use your car for?

140
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,240
Mostly for getting to work.

141
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,110
I live quite far from the nearest metro station
and the bus lines aren’t good, so it’s

142
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,620
much easier to drive.

143
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,080
Sometimes we go out of town for the weekends,
too.

144
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,170
Next, let’s look at some of the positive
points which Stephanie showed in this section.

145
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,680
First, she chose a very specific topic.

146
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,720
This meant she needed a lot of specialised
vocabulary to talk about it, like transmission,

147
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:38,120
drive stick, clutch, stall, honking and so
on.

148
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:44,820
If you’re aiming for a high score, you need
to choose a topic which lets you go into more

149
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,459
depth and use some more varied language.

150
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:55,040
If you choose a very simple topic, it’ll
be difficult to get top scores for language.

151
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,970
You can also see that I covered all of the
points from the cue card in detail, and

152
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:06,520
didn’t add any irrelevant information or
go off topic.

153
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:13,480
Oli already mentioned the specialised vocabulary,
but I also used some idiomatic language, like

154
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:23,620
I guess, doubly hard, extra frustrating, super
stressful, or get the clutch right.

155
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:30,600
You need to use idiomatic language naturally
and accurately to get a top score in IELTS

156
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,790
speaking.

157
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:38,430
Idiomatic language doesn’t just mean idioms
like “raining cats and dogs”; it also

158
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:45,260
includes conversational words and phrases
that are common in native English speech.

159
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,610
Don’t forget about the follow-up questions
in part two.

160
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:56,649
After you finish speaking, the examiner will
ask one or two simple follow-up questions

161
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:59,279
about what you said.

162
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,690
You don’t need long answers here, but you
should give focused, well-developed answers,

163
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,640
like with every IELTS question!

164
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:16,000
Finally, let’s look at part three of the
IELTS speaking test.

165
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,529
Right, I’d like to ask some questions related
to this topic.

166
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:24,550
First, let’s talk about learning new things.

167
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,209
What motivates people to learn new things?

168
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,250
Wow… that’s a big question!

169
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,860
Well, there are lots of reasons.

170
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,600
The main one I guess is just necessity.

171
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,890
For example, if you want to work in a particular
field, you’ll need some specific training,

172
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,190
skills, qualifications…

173
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:48,880
Then, when you start a new job, you generally
have to adapt and learn a lot of new things,

174
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,790
even if you came in with a lot of theoretical
knowledge.

175
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,680
What else?

176
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,220
I think also interest is important…

177
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,120
I mean, people learn to do new things because
they’re interested in them or they find

178
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,030
something enjoyable.

179
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:09,820
For example, no one needs to learn to play
a musical instrument, but a lot of people

180
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,080
do so because it brings them pleasure.

181
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,260
Do you think the way that people learn new
things has changed compared to the past?

182
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,200
Absolutely.

183
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:25,370
Of course, the Internet and the development
of smartphones and other new technologies

184
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,399
have had a huge influence.

185
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,620
We all have easy access to so much information
now, which wasn’t the case in the past at

186
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,730
all.

187
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:40,339
Before, people would need to dedicate a lot
of time and effort to finding an expert, or

188
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:43,520
doing research in order to learn about something
new.

189
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,540
Now, you can find tutorials online, ask people
for help in discussion forums, and things

190
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,540
like that.

191
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,310
So, it’s a big difference, but I think it’s
mostly for the better.

192
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:00,850
How do you think technology will change the
way people learn new things in the future?

193
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,850
Hmm…

194
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,240
I’m not sure.

195
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,800
I think we’ll see the same trends developing…

196
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,380
What I mean is: the big changes have already
happened, but I don’t think they’ve run

197
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,380
their course yet.

198
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,589
So, a lot of people still have the idea that
you learn something by going to a class, reading

199
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:24,079
books, and so on, and they haven’t realised that
you just have more options nowadays.

200
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,180
To tie all this together, I think that in
the future, education and learning will be

201
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:34,620
more globalised and democratic, in that everybody
will have similar opportunities to learn.

202
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:40,000
I suppose that might mean that formal education
diminishes in significance, but I’m not

203
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,839
sure that will actually happen.

204
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,790
Okay, let’s move on to talk about school
and education.

205
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:52,170
How can parents or students choose the best
school or university?

206
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:57,250
In my experience, the only way to know what
a school or university is really like is to

207
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,899
talk to people who already study there and
see what they say.

208
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,860
Of course, you can go and look around, but
I don’t think you can learn very much just

209
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,480
by walking around a school.

210
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,730
If you talk to some of the staff and students,
you can get a feel of what kind of establishment

211
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,000
it is, and whether it’s a good fit for you,
or your child, whoever you’re talking about.

212
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Mm-hmm.

213
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,910
How do people in your country feel about private
education?

214
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,959
Huh…

215
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,430
I really don’t know.

216
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,420
I went to a public school, and so did everyone
I know.

217
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,070
It’s not really a topic which comes up that
much, you know?

218
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:37,290
Personally, I don’t have strong opinions;
if someone wants to pay to send their child

219
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,530
to a private school, then why not?

220
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:44,140
Given that there aren’t that many private
schools, it’s just not something that people

221
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,440
are so aware of.

222
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,010
I see.

223
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,399
Do you think that university education should
be free?

224
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,700
Definitely, yes.

225
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:57,839
In the USA, university is insanely expensive;
parents have to start saving up from the moment

226
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,420
their child is born.

227
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,790
I think this leads to elitist outcomes…

228
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,200
I mean that the richest kids go to the best
universities, and if you don’t have a lot

229
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,820
of money behind you, your options are more
limited.

230
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,350
That said, I realize that graduates tend to
earn more, so it might be fairer to have some

231
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:20,800
kind of graduate tax, so that the people who
erm… benefit from higher education also

232
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,600
help to fund it.

233
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,730
That seems to me to be the fairest solution.

234
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,760
Thank you.

235
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,940
That’s the end of the speaking test.

236
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:35,560
So, let’s look at these answers more closely,
and see what made them effective.

237
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,259
Many things here you’ve already heard.

238
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:44,769
Stephanie’s answers were fluent, relevant,
well-developed and clear.

239
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:52,650
She used a wide range of grammar and vocabulary
accurately, including idiomatic language.

240
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:58,510
She also used linking phrases and fillers
to keep her answers fluent, even when she

241
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,670
was dealing with more difficult answers.

242
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,090
For example:
At the start, she used fillers to give herself

243
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:11,380
thinking time without leaving an unnatural
pause.

244
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:17,960
She also used linking phrases, like what I
mean is and to tie this all together to focus

245
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,400
her answer when she wasn’t sure how to finish
a sentence or an idea.

246
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,980
Remember that you can read the full script
of this video on our website: Oxford Online

247
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,029

248
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:38,730
You can read the answers and see exactly what
words, phrases and structures I used to answer

249
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,050
these questions.

250
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,880
Have you taken the IELTS speaking exam recently?

251
