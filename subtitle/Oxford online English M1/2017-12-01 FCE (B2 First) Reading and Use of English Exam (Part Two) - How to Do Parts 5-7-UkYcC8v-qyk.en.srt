00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,420
Hello, I'm Kasia.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,910
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,120
In this lesson, you can learn about how to
do the Cambridge FCE reading and use of English

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,120
exam.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,710
You’ll see what to expect in the FCE reading
and use of English test and how to improve

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,350
your score.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,430
This is part two of a two-part video on the
FCE Reading and Use of English exam.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:30,950
In this lesson, you’re going to learn about
parts five, six and seven.

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,579
If you haven’t seen part one, then go and
watch that one first!

10
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:39,420
All the questions in parts five and six are
worth two marks each.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,140
The questions in part seven are worth one
mark each.

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,089
The good news is that these parts of the test
are based on reading texts, which many students

13
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:52,469
find easier than the more grammatical questions.

14
00:00:52,469 --> 00:01:00,079
The bad news is that you need to allow plenty
of time to read and answer these questions.

15
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,879
Make sure you practice your time management
before the exam so you have enough time for

16
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,020
the questions at the end.

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,509
So that's the basic information you need.

18
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:17,310
Let’s look at each part of the exam in more
detail.

19
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,990
In part five, you’ll be given a longer text,
with six questions at the end.

20
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,650
Each question is multiple choice, with four
possible answers.

21
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:33,850
The questions in part five often focus on
understanding people’s feelings and ideas,

22
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,440
instead of simple facts about the text.

23
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,840
Look at this sample question.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,509
Pause the video and read it.

25
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,799
This is an extract from the longer text.

26
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,450
Look at the multiple-choice question that
goes with it:

27
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,539
What can be inferred about the woman who walked
into the coffee house?

28
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,539
a.

29
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:00,710
She was a regular customer at the coffee house.

30
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,710
b.

31
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,270
She had not expected Jane.

32
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,270
c.

33
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,719
She wasn’t really Mrs Greene.

34
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,719
d.

35
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,070
She had just woken up.

36
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:18,099
Remember that inferred refers to something
that is not directly said.

37
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:23,790
That means that you need an overall understanding
of the text, its ideas, and how the people

38
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,790
mentioned in the text might be feeling.

39
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,440
You won’t generally be able to find one
word or phrase which gives you the answer.

40
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:39,030
So, you have to look for clues to see what
people are thinking, or how they feel.

41
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,480
Can you work out what the answer is?

42
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:50,190
If it’s difficult, re-read the text and
try to eliminate some of the possible answers.

43
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,870
Let's look together.

44
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:59,470
When you read the text again, there is no
mention of the woman being a regular customer,

45
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,500
or of not being the real Mrs. Greene.

46
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,239
She might be a regular customer of course,
but there aren’t any clues in the text that

47
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,860
suggest that.

48
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,750
So, you can cross out options 'a' and 'c'.

49
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,841
That leaves only 'b' and 'd'.

50
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:25,069
At this point, you could guess and have a
50/50 chance of getting it right.

51
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:31,680
But, of course, it’s better to figure out
the correct answer.

52
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,159
Option 'b' says: "She had not expected Jane."

53
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,379
This might seem possible, especially since
the woman doesn’t even talk to her!

54
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:49,150
But, the fact that the woman knew the time
and place to arrive doesn’t fit with that.

55
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:55,200
And look at what Jane says in the text: “…I’ve
come for the meeting, I’m your new assistant,”

56
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,040
said Jane cheerfully."

57
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:05,690
She says that she already is the new assistant,
which means that she is definitely expected,

58
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:11,370
so this can’t be the right answer.

59
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,220
Now look at option 'd' again: "She had just
woken up."

60
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,940
Look at the text again.

61
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:26,360
Can you find any clues that might show that
the woman had recently been asleep?

62
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,580
In the text, the woman is described as having
"bleary eyes" and "grunting" at Jane, before

63
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,930
ordering "a large coffee."

64
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:42,060
All of these are things you might have or
do when you’ve just woken up.

65
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:48,530
This shows that the correct answer is 'd':
"She had just woken up."

66
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:54,720
To prepare for this part of the test, it’s
useful to read stories, interviews, or maybe

67
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:03,090
blog posts; read texts which focus more on
people, their thoughts, opinions and feelings.

68
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,490
As you read, try to infer meaning from the
clues in the text.

69
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,340
Ask yourself questions like:

70
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,150
What’s this person’s opinion?

71
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,310
How do I know?

72
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,810
What kind of person is this?

73
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,419
How do I know?

74
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:25,380
Asking yourself these kinds of questions while
reading will help improve your reading level

75
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,729
in English and you’ll be more likely to
get a better score in your FCE reading and

76
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:32,190
use of English exam.

77
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:39,069
Now, let’s move on to part six!

78
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:45,270
In this part of the exam, there will be one,
shorter text, with six sentences missing.

79
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:50,940
The six missing sentences will be given to
you in random order after the text.

80
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:57,130
A seventh, extra sentence that wasn’t removed
from the text will be there as well, just

81
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,349
to confuse you!

82
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:07,310
You have to read the text, then the sentences,
and decide which sentence fits in which gap.

83
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:13,390
Let’s look at part of a sample question:

84
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:18,990
As before, you can pause the video to have
time to read the text and think about what

85
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,199
might be missing.

86
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,210
You can see that the first sentence in the
text has finished.

87
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,750
However, after the gap, the text starts with
a 'but'.

88
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,320
What does that mean?

89
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:39,580
It means that you’re looking for a contrasting
idea.

90
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:45,919
Do you see how the structure of the text can
give you an idea of what to look for?

91
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,240
This is important, because a common mistake
is only to pay attention to the words before

92
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
the gap.

93
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:59,889
You need to pay attention to the words after
the gap, too, because they can be equally

94
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,169
important.

95
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:03,440
Look at the text again.

96
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:10,900
You need a contrasting idea, but what could
the contrast in the text be?

97
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,389
Now, look at the missing sentences.

98
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:19,350
Can you see which one is the correct one?

99
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:26,150
Okay, do you know which is the correct answer?

100
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,290
The correct answer is ‘b’.

101
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,970
Do you know why?

102
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,550
In the text, it says:

103
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:43,910
But, for a gymnast in particular, this lengthy
period has to start before the effects of

104
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,140
adolescence set in…

105
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,890
The key words here are in particular.

106
00:07:52,890 --> 00:08:00,050
The text is talking about gymnasts in particular,
so the missing sentence isn’t specifically

107
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,789
about gymnasts.

108
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:09,830
Answer 'c' specifically mentions gymnasts,
so that needs to be eliminated.

109
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,560
That leaves only answers 'a' and 'b' that
are more general.

110
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,520
If you get stuck, look for other clues.

111
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,889
There’s often more than one clue which can
lead you to the correct answer.

112
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,139
The text mentions a lengthy period.

113
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:34,290
When you read answers 'a' and 'b' again, you
can see that 'b' mentions at least a decade,

114
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,770
which is also a lengthy period.

115
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:44,260
Of course, in the exam, you will have seven
sentences to read through, not three, and

116
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,790
the text will be longer, but the principle
is the same.

117
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,940
Remember about the main points here:

118
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,280
Pay attention to the words before and after
the gap.

119
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:05,070
Think about what kind of idea is missing:
is it an example, a contrasting idea, an extension

120
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:11,190
of an idea already in the text, or something
else?

121
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:19,130
Look for any clues that can confirm or eliminate
a possible answer; remember that there could

122
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,650
be more than one way to find the right answer.

123
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:32,250
Next, let’s talk about part seven of the
reading and use of English exam.

124
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,540
Part seven is another kind of matching activity.

125
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:45,290
This time, you’ll have ten questions, followed
by one long text or several shorter texts.

126
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:50,010
Each section of the text will have a letter,
for example, A – D.

127
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:57,160
You’ll need to match each question to the
correct section of the text.

128
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Each section can be used more than once.

129
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:10,380
The most important skill here is skimming:
you need to be able to read a text quickly

130
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,380
and find the most important pieces of information.

131
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:22,920
Let’s look at a sample question so you can
see what to expect.

132
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:29,970
First, read the instructions:

133
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:36,310
In the exam you’ll get ten questions, but
let’s look at two questions so you can practise

134
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,820
this part now.

135
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,330
Here are the questions:

136
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,510
Which person saw a film that…

137
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,210
1) Contained two stories.

138
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,430
2) Finished in an unrealistic way.

139
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:57,040
Now, look at four extracts from a text.

140
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,940
We’ve shortened them for the video, so they’ll
be longer in the exam, but this will show

141
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,550
you what to expect:

142
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:16,080
Pause the video and read the extracts, then
start again when you’re ready.

143
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,230
In this part of the test, you’re looking
for similar ideas that can be expressed in

144
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,620
different ways.

145
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,180
Let’s look at the first question:

146
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:33,210
Which person saw a film that contained two
stories?

147
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:40,500
This is an easier question, as the text directly
mentions one of the films having two stories.

148
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,750
Can you see which one?

149
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:49,400
The correct answer is B. Can you see why?

150
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,960
This question is relatively easy, by FCE standards.

151
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:00,480
However, with other questions, you’ll need
to use inference and understand indirect meanings

152
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,030
to find the right answer.

153
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,760
Now, look at the second question:

154
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,290
Which person saw a film that finished in an
unrealistic way?

155
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:20,770
Read the text again; can you figure out the
answer?

156
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:31,650
A is complaining about a lack of originality,
but it doesn’t say it finished unrealistically.

157
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:38,210
B mentions that only one part of the film
held their interest, which also doesn’t

158
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,210
fit.

159
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,500
You can immediately eliminate those two options.

160
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:50,290
That leaves you with just two options: C or
D.

161
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:59,510
C says that a setting with an uncertain future
shouldn’t have a happy ending, while D complains

162
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:05,690
that the love story doesn’t seem like love
to her.

163
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,850
Do you know the correct answer?

164
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,510
It’s C.

165
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:21,590
D does complain about a lack of realism, because
he or she says that the supposedly intelligent

166
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,850
characters do stupid things.

167
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:34,080
However, the question relates to an unrealistic
ending, not a general lack of realism.

168
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:42,480
C is the only answer which fits, because C
complains that the ending does not fit with

169
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:51,080
the overall setting and mood of the film,
i.e. it’s unrealistic.

170
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,660
