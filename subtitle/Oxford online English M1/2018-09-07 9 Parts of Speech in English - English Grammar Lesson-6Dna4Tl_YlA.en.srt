00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,900
Hi, I’m Kasia.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,230
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,660
In this lesson, you can learn about parts
of speech in English.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,900
How many parts of speech are there in English?

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,049
Can you name them, and explain what they do?

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:23,259
Understanding parts of speech—nouns, verbs,
adjectives, and so on—can help you to understand

7
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:27,130
English sentence structure and how English
grammar works.

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:33,520
In this class, you’ll learn the basic information
about parts of speech, you’ll see some ways

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,060
that parts of speech can be more complicated
than you might expect, and you’ll have several

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,950
chances to practice!

11
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,510
So, first question: how many parts of speech
are there?

12
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:50,230
Well, I did a Google search, and many of the
top results said ‘eight’.

13
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,000
So there must be eight parts of speech in
English.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,020
Wrong!

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,550
There are nine.

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,180
Ah, what are they?

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,680
Number one: nouns.

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,960
Nouns can be things, animals, or people, like
doctor, pencil, tree or cat.

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,690
Nouns can also be ideas or abstract things,
like idea, happiness, time or money.

20
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,150
Number two: verbs.

21
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,720
Verbs can be actions, like do, run, fly or
win.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,420
Verbs can also describe states, like be, love,
believe or understand.

23
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,480
Number three: adjectives.

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,200
Adjectives describe nouns.

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,680
For example: red, big, metal, or beautiful.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,080
Number four: adverbs.

27
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:51,200
Adverbs can describe verbs, meaning they describe
how someone does something.

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,360
For example, quickly, loudly, angrily or well.

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,369
Adverbs can also describe adjectives, other
adverbs, or even whole sentences.

30
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:10,140
For example, very is an adverb which can describe
an adjective—very slow—or another adverb—very

31
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,680
slowly.

32
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,540
Unfortunately or sometimes are adverbs which
can be used to add information to a whole

33
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,310
sentence.

34
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,370
For example:

35
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,440
Unfortunately, they missed the train and were
late to their own wedding!

36
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,510
Sometimes, I wish I’d made different choices
in life.

37
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,549
So, adverbs are a little more complicated.

38
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:40,079
Here’s a good way to remember it: adjectives
and adverbs both describe other words.

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,880
They are both used to add information to something
else.

40
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:54,799
Adjectives describe nouns, and adverbs describe
everything else: verbs, adjectives, adverbs

41
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,319
and whole sentences.

42
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:00,200
Number five: pronouns.

43
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,889
Pronouns replace or represent nouns.

44
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:09,900
For example, I, you, she or they are pronouns
which represent different people.

45
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,840
You use pronouns to avoid repeating the same
word, or to refer to something when it’s

46
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,480
obvious what you mean.

47
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,260
For example:

48
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,159
How was the weather there?

49
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,519
There is a pronoun which refers to a place.

50
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,760
If you’ve already mentioned the place you’re
talking about, you don’t need to say it

51
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,680
again.

52
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,360
Another example:

53
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,599
Give me two, please.

54
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:43,430
Two is a pronoun which refers to a quantity
of something which has already been mentioned.

55
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,969
The person you’re talking to already knows
what you’re talking about.

56
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:51,840
Number six: prepositions.

57
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,459
Prepositions usually go before a noun or noun
phrase.

58
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,680
What’s their job?

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:08,699
Prepositions can do two basic things: first,
they can add an idea of time, place, or movement

60
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,139
to a noun.

61
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:12,599
For example:

62
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:18,229
on Wednesday
in the corner

63
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:20,300
towards the door

64
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:25,750
Secondly, prepositions can connect other words
to a noun, or a pronoun.

65
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,250
For example, think about the verb depend on.

66
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,420
The preposition on connects the verb depend
to the object of the verb.

67
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,660
For example:

68
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,270
It depends on the cost.

69
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,110
Usually, the noun or noun phrase goes after
the preposition.

70
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:48,350
However, sometimes the preposition can link
to a noun (or pronoun) earlier in the sentence.

71
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,930
For example:

72
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,509
What does it depend on?

73
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:54,419
Here, on links to the pronoun what.

74
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,450
Conjunctions.

75
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,320
Conjunctions connect two things.

76
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,310
A conjunction can connect two words:

77
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,259
I like cake and ice-cream.

78
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:10,740
A conjunction can connect two phrases:

79
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,100
Do you want to go now or wait till this afternoon?

80
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,560
You can also use a conjunction to connect
two clauses:

81
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,009
Although I’ve been trying to learn for years,
I’m still really bad at drawing.

82
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,500
Number eight: determiners

83
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,160
Determiners go before a noun.

84
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:39,259
They include words like a, the, this or that,
which help to specify which noun you’re

85
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,700
talking about.

86
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:46,240
Words like my, your, his, her, etc. are also
determiners.

87
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,069
They specify which noun you’re talking about
by saying who something belongs to.

88
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:57,289
Determiners can also tell you how many of
something there are.

89
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:59,389
Look at three examples:

90
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:02,150
ten bananas
some people

91
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,090
both of my brothers

92
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,840
The words ten, some and both are determiners.

93
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,030
Number nine: interjections

94
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,420
Interjections are different, because they
aren’t normally part of a sentence.

95
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,880
Interjections are words or phrases which show
how you feel.

96
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,960
For example:

97
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,540
Wow!

98
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,500
Ah, crap!

99
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,350
No way!

100
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:36,600
So, now you know about the nine parts of speech
in English.

101
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,120
Let’s practice!

102
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,740
Look at three sentences.

103
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,449
Each sentence has five words.

104
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:43,449
1.

105
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:44,740
They told me about it.

106
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,740
2.

107
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,229
Look in the big cupboard.

108
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:48,259
3.

109
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:51,100
Put it there, but carefully.

110
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,379
Can you identify which part of speech each
word is?

111
00:06:55,379 --> 00:07:00,509
Pause the video and think about your answers.

112
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:02,120
How did you do?

113
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,490
Could you identify the parts of speech correctly?

114
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,620
Let’s look at one more.

115
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,789
I’m staying in this evening.

116
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:13,780
What part of speech are these words?

117
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,620
Think about it.

118
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,999
So, I is a pronoun, am is a verb, and staying
is also a verb.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,020
What about in?

120
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,130
Did you say it’s a preposition?

121
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,509
It’s not a preposition; it’s an adverb.

122
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:30,220
How does this work?

123
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:36,819
We had the word in in one of the sentences
you saw before, and it was a preposition.

124
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,360
So, what’s going on?

125
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,980
Some words can only be one thing.

126
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:50,090
For example, the words independence or hair
can only be nouns.

127
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,919
Believe and destroy can only be verbs.

128
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,050
However, many words can be more than one part
of speech.

129
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,880
There are two things happening here.

130
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,970
First, a word can be two different things,
which have the same written form and the same

131
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,539
pronunciation.

132
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,920
Think about the word win.

133
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,980
Is it a noun or a verb?

134
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,331
It can be both.

135
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:18,719
I’m sure they’ll win the game this weekend.

136
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,440
We’ll be hoping for a win in the big game
this weekend.

137
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,400
Many words are like this.

138
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,940
Red can be an adjective or
a noun.

139
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,300
What do you think about this red for the kitchen?

140
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,600
I like that red top she was wearing.

141
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:41,910
This is very common: very often, a word with
one written form can be two (or more) different

142
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,500
parts of speech.

143
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,670
We told you there are two things happening
here; what’s the other?

144
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:54,910
Sometimes, a word can be different parts of
speech depending on its function in the sentence.

145
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,060
Look at two sentences:

146
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,170
I have a few photos of my grandparents.

147
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,280
Sure, you can have a few.

148
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:09,470
Here’s a question: what part of speech is
few in these sentences?

149
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,810
In the first sentence, few is a determiner;
in the second, it’s a pronoun.

150
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,590
Can you explain why this is?

151
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,190
Think about what few does in these two sentences.

152
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:29,770
In the first sentence, few adds a quantity
to the noun photos.

153
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,770
It tells us how many photos you have.

154
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,280
This makes it a determiner.

155
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,800
In the second sentence, few replaces a noun.

156
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:46,140
You don’t know which noun it replaces, but
in context, you would understand what the

157
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,730
person meant.

158
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,850
Maybe it was ‘a few biscuits’, or ‘a
few pieces of paper.’

159
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,260
We don’t know!

160
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:59,660
But, you do know that few replaces a noun,
which makes it a pronoun.

161
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,980
Another example is the sentence we saw before:

162
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,790
I’m staying in this evening.

163
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:12,260
Prepositions go with nouns, and connect nouns
to other words in the sentence.

164
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,690
In here doesn’t go with a noun, so it can’t
be a preposition.

165
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:24,270
In here means ‘at home’, and it adds information
to the verb stay.

166
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,100
What kind of words add information to verbs?

167
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,520
Adverbs!

168
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,440
So, in is an adverb.

169
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,630
Wait a minute, did we ever finish explaining
what parts of speech are in this sentence?

170
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,950
You’re right!

171
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,950
We didn’t.

172
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,330
Let’s do it now.

173
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:47,620
You need to say what parts of speech the words
this evening are.

174
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,710
Can you do it?

175
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,950
Maybe you said that this is a determiner,
and evening is a noun.

176
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,130
That’s technically correct, but it’s not
the best answer.

177
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,120
The best answer is that this evening is an
adverb.

178
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,360
How do you explain that?

179
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:13,840
Until now, you’ve seen single words, and
how single words can be nouns, verbs, etc.

180
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:20,130
However, when you’re thinking about parts
of speech, you can’t just think about single

181
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,680
words.

182
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,100
Phrases can also be nouns, verbs, adjectives,
and so on.

183
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,120
Let’s do an example:

184
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:38,720
Add a small spoonful of brown sugar, then
turn the heat down and stir the mixture gently.

185
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,990
Think about the first part of this sentence:
add a small spoonful of brown sugar.

186
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,500
What parts of speech do we have here?

187
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,750
Of course, you can go through it word by word.

188
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:57,390
You can say, add is a verb, a is a determiner,
small is an adjective and so on.

189
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,930
But, is that the most useful way of looking
at it?

190
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:10,880
It makes more sense to see this as a verb—add—and
a noun—a small spoonful of brown sugar.

191
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:18,000
The noun is made up of several parts of speech:
determiners, adjectives, prepositions and

192
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,620
nouns, but together they have one meaning.

193
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,690
These words refer to one thing.

194
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,680
You can analyse a sentence in several different
layers.

195
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:38,260
So, you can see a small spoonful of brown
sugar as six individual words, or one noun

196
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,260
phrase.

197
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:47,180
You could also see it as three parts: a determiner—a
small spoonful, a preposition—of, and a

198
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,240
noun—brown sugar.

199
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,460
Confused?

200
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,240
We understand!

201
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,620
You want to know the answer.

202
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,640
You want to know which way is ‘correct’.

203
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,220
There isn’t one ‘correct’ way to say
this.

204
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,820
There are different perspectives.

205
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,880
A better question is: which perspective makes
more sense?

206
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,430
In this sentence, a small spoonful of brown
sugar refers to one thing in the world.

207
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:21,000
So it makes sense to think of it as one part
of speech in the sentence.

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,850
What about the second part of the sentence?

209
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,740
How would you analyse the parts of speech?

210
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:32,510
As you saw before, there isn’t one right
answer, but here’s a suggestion.

211
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:38,890
The sentence contains a conjunction—then,
and then two verb phrases linked with the

212
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,240
conjunction and.

213
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:48,970
This makes sense because the sentence is telling
you to do two things: turn the heat down and

214
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,550
stir the mixture gently.

215
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:57,260
So, it makes sense to see turn the heat down
as one part of speech, because it’s telling

216
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,240
you do to one thing.

217
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,160
Let’s put these ideas together.

218
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,890
First, when you think about parts of speech,
you can’t just memorise information.

219
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:15,470
You have to look at each sentence individually,
and think about what each word is doing.

220
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:21,380
Secondly, always think about what the sentence
means in the real world.

221
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:29,230
Sentences aren’t abstract things; they refer
to real people, real things and real actions.

222
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:34,391
There is always more than one way to analyse
the parts of speech in a sentence: choose

223
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,760
the way that makes sense based on what the
sentence is telling you about real life!

224
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:47,980
Let’s do a more challenging practice exercise
so you can see these ideas in action.

225
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,120
Look at three sentences:

226
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,620
Amazing!

227
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,790
It’s way better than I ever thought it would
be.

228
00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:00,020
She was an amazing clinician, who came up
with many innovative ways to treat patients.

229
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,940
I don’t believe it!

230
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,100
How would you analyse the parts of speech
in these sentences?

231
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,790
Think about the ideas we talked about in the
last section.

232
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,700
Does it make sense to break the sentences
into individual words, or is it better to

233
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,070
group words into phrases?

234
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,790
Pause the video and think about your ideas.

235
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,030
Ready?

236
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,940
Here are our answers.

237
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:31,030
You can pause the video again to look at these
in more detail.

238
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:37,870
Notice how the same word can be different
parts of speech in different sentences.

239
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:45,570
For example, amazing is an interjection in
one sentence, and an adjective in another.

240
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,680
Notice also the different layers of analysis.

241
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,850
For example, look at the phrase many innovative
ways.

242
00:15:52,850 --> 00:16:00,660
You can see this as one noun phrase, or as
a determiner plus a noun phrase, or as three

243
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:05,890
individual parts: a determiner, an adjective
and a noun.

244
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,180
Which is correct?

245
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,750
They all are!

246
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,250
Choose the perspective which makes more sense
to you.

247
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,620
