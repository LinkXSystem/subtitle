00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,410
Hi!

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:06,770
I’m Olivier, welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:12,839
When you started learning English, I’m fine
is probably one of the first things you learnt.

4
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:18,870
It’s a simple way of answering the question
How are you?

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,650
Fine is, well, fine!

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:27,300
But if you use it all the time, it can get
very repetitive, and a little boring.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,670
Does this look familiar to anyone?

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,070
Hi, how are you?

9
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,510
I’m fine thank you, and you?

10
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,140
Hi, how are you?

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,329
I’m fine thank you, and you?

12
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:46,760
Hi, how are you?

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,690
I’m fine thank you, and you?

14
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,300
Hi, how are you?

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,940
I’m fine thank you, and you?

16
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,250
I think you get the idea.

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,720
Even with very simple language, it’s better
if your language is varied.

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,720
So, how can you make this more interesting?

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,500
Here are a few ideas.

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,560
Hi, how are you?

21
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,450
I’m good, thanks, you?

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,940
Hi, how are you?

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,100
I’m pretty good.

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,940
Hi, how are you?

25
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,510
I’m OK.

26
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,250
Hi, how are you?

27
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,770
Not bad, thanks.

28
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,380
Hi, how are you?

29
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,360
I’m very well.

30
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,800
Hi, how are you?

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,900
I’m great!

32
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,210
Remember that it’s polite to also ask the
other person how they are, too.

33
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,070
You can do this by simply adding you?

34
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,430
Or, and you?

35
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,370
For example:

36
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,080
I’m very well, and you?

37
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,040
I’m great!

38
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,000
You?

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,590
Notice that the intonation rises at the end
to show that you’re asking a question.

40
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:22,090
Now, you’ve learned some ways to answer
the question how are you, but what about the

41
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,880
question itself?

42
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:34,910
Like I’m fine, there are many ways to ask
how are you, and you should try to add variety

43
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,540
to your English when you speak.

44
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:46,260
By the way, you probably wouldn’t ask a
person you see regularly ‘how are you?’.

45
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:53,110
If you see them often it might sound strange
because nothing has changed since the last

46
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,540
time you saw them.

47
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,280
Here are a few alternatives you can use.

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,220
These are more informal, but they’re very
common in everyday situations.

49
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,400
How’s it going?

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,340
How’re things?

51
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,270
How’re you doing?

52
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,650
How’s life?

53
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:22,130
In informal spoken English, you should use
contractions and link words to sound natural.

54
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:30,069
So, make sure you say How’s it going, with
a contraction of is.

55
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:36,730
You can’t use the full form—How is it
going—unless you want to sound like a robot.

56
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:43,240
Similarly, how’re you doing needs to be
pronounced with a contraction of are: how’re

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,780
you doing?

58
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,980
You can even leave out the word are and just
say how you doing?

59
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:57,460
Next, let’s see how you can put these greetings
together in a real situation.

60
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,460
Hey!

61
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,660
How’s it going?

62
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,840
Pretty good thanks, you?

63
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,670
Yeah, not bad.

64
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,910
Hi, Olivier, how’re things?

65
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,120
Good, thanks, and you?

66
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,110
I’m good!

67
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:21,690
Next, let’s look at some even more informal
ways of asking or answering the question how

68
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,600
are you.

69
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,940
Here are three very informal questions you
can use to ask how are you:

70
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,190
How’s tricks?

71
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,880
What’s up?

72
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,240
What’s new?

73
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,280
Alright?

74
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,660
Remember that these are very informal.

75
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,570
That doesn’t mean they’re rude or that
you shouldn’t use them, but you can’t

76
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,880
use them in more formal situations.

77
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:05,750
And yes, how’s tricks is grammatically incorrect,
but that’s the phrase which people use!

78
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,720
These are common between friends and people
who know each other well.

79
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,070
Remember what you learned about linking words
earlier?

80
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,200
It’s also important here.

81
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,220
You don’t say, What is up?

82
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,960
You say, What’s up?

83
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,910
And, you don’t say, What is new?

84
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,970
You say, What’s new?

85
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,990
These different questions can also have different
responses.

86
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,380
Let’s look!

87
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,400
Alright?

88
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,700
Yeah, you?

89
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,380
Yeah, not bad.

90
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,940
What’s new?

91
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,120
Not a lot!

92
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,389
You?

93
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:52,389
Nothing much.

94
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:58,480
It might sound negative to you to just say
nothing, but it’s a very common expression

95
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,620
to say that you’re well.

96
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:09,090
Because these are very informal ways to ask
how are you, sometimes they’re used as greetings.

97
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,919
This means that sometimes these questions
don’t need an answer.

98
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,300
When using these phrases, you can simply answer
with an informal greeting, like this:

99
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,820
What’s up?

100
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,120
Hey, what’s up?

101
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,740
Alright?

102
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,139
Hey!

103
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,520
What else do you need to think about in these
situations?

104
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:40,690
It’s important that you continue the conversation
after you answer the how are you question.

105
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,160
How can you do that?

106
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:52,140
Even if you’re a master of greeting phrases
in English, that won’t help you if this happens:

107
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,820
Hi, how are you?

108
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,070
I’m fine thank you, and you?

109
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,870
Fine thanks.

110
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:11,000
So, what can you say after the initial greeting?

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,970
You have many choices!

112
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,800
Basically, you can make a statement, or ask
a question.

113
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,951
For example, you could tell the other person
something about yourself and your life, like

114
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:26,759
this:

115
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:36,300
Actually, work was pretty stressful, but now
I’m looking forward to…

116
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,860
I had a really good day today, because…

117
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,760
I’ve just been to…

118
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,780
Or there’s always the weather!

119
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,180
It’s really hot today, isn’t it?

120
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,789
It’s been so wet the last few days.

121
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,169
Hopefully it’ll be brighter this weekend!

122
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:04,580
British people love to talk about the weather,
if you hadn’t realised yet!

123
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:09,789
You can also ask another question, such as:

124
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,430
How was your day?

125
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,949
How’s your day going?

126
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:19,400
How was your weekend?

127
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,460
If you’re even more confident, or you know more
about the person you’re talking to, you

128
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,070
can go into more detail and ask them more
specific questions.

129
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,030
For example:

130
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,550
How was your trip to Madrid last weekend?

131
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,039
Did you watch the football last night?

132
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,610
Is your brother visiting you next week, or
is it the week after?

133
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:48,360
Now, you should know how to greet people,
how to ask and answer how are you in different

134
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,679
ways, and how to continue the conversation.

135
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,140
Let’s see how you can put everything together.

136
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,839
Hey, how are things?

137
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,569
I’m good thanks, but a little tired today:
busy at work.

138
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:10,700
How about you?

139
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,560
I’m well, but I’ve got a lot at work too.

140
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,569
How was your trip to Madrid last weekend?

141
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:17,569
Fantastic!

142
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:21,149
It’s a really great city.

143
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:24,490
What did you do last weekend?

144
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,959
Nothing much, just relaxed on the beach!

145
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,920
Very nice!

146
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,540
Hi, what’s new?

147
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,930
Not much, you?

148
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,220
Yeah, alright.

149
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,480
You look a bit tired.

150
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,380
Yeah, I didn’t sleep well last night.

151
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,699
Oh no, why not?

152
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:53,510
My neighbours had a big party and it was really
loud.

153
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,600
I hate it when people do that.

154
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,920
Yeah, me too.

155
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,080
Anyway, how’s your day going?

156
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,180
Now, it’s your turn to practice!

157
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:09,579
Imagine somebody asks how are you?

158
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:13,619
Can you write down five possible things you
could say?

159
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:20,560
Pause the video and write down your answers
now.

160
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,080
Ready?

161
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,680
Let’s look.

162
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,480
Of course, there are more than five possible
answers.

163
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,760
These are just suggestions:

164
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,520
I’m good.

165
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,880
I’m pretty good.

166
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,460
Not bad.

167
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,160
A little bit tired.

168
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,379
Great, thanks!

169
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:44,059
And what about different ways to ask how are
you?

170
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,940
What can you say?

171
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:52,449
Pause the video and write down five different
ways to ask this question.

172
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:54,420
OK?

173
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,800
Again, these are just suggestions.

174
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,560
There are many possibilities!

175
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,220
How’s it going?

176
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,410
How’re you doing?

177
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,769
