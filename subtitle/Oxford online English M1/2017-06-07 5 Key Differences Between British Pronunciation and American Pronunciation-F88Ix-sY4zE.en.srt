00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:08,860
Hi I'm Oli. Welcome to Oxford Online English.
In this lesson you can learn about the differences

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:17,520
between American and British pronunciation.
I'm going to teach Oli how to say words like

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:26,179
'water' or 'clock' correctly. No, no. I'm
going to teach Gina how to pronounce 'water'

4
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:35,570
and 'clock' properly. We're joking of course.
There's no one correct way to pronounce English.

5
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:42,480
There are many ways to speak English, not
just British or American.

6
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,250
Also, remember that both the UK and the USA
are big countries and not everybody talks

7
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:55,350
the same way. What you'll see in this lesson
are general differences between British and

8
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,329
American pronunciation.
Let’s start with one of the biggest differences

9
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:09,030
between British and American pronunciation.
This is a difference you can see.

10
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:17,180
Watch an American person talk; watch a British
person talk. What do you notice?

11
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:23,400
British English is much more frontal; it uses
the lips a lot more.

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:32,670
By contrast, American English speakers move
their lips less. The lips are more relaxed

13
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,840
and the mouth is generally wider.

14
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,549
In American English, sounds generally come
from further back in the mouth, closer to

15
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:45,390
the throat.

16
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,229
British English is a lot ‘tenser’. To
sound British, you need to produce a lot of

17
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:58,640
sounds at the front of your mouth. Vowel sounds
are often shorter than in American English,

18
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,659
meaning you need to move between sounds faster.

19
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:09,220
All of this means you need to use the muscles
of your lips and cheeks more.

20
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,370
For example, let’s think about the word
water.

21
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,260
When I say it,
the first vowel sound is much more relaxed.

22
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:29,400
I don’t use my lips to pronounce the sound
at all: water.

23
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:37,200
The vowel sound is often a little longer than
in British English. Then, the rest of the

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,370
sounds come from further back: water.

25
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,380
When I say water,
the vowel sound is much tenser. I’m using

26
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:55,860
the muscles of my cheeks, and pushing my lips
into a small, rounded shape: water.

27
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,530
I then pronounce the rest of the sounds near
the front of my mouth, without really relaxing

28
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:08,330
back much: water. Water.

29
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:14,790
Let me try that the American way: 'water'.
'Water'.

30
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:25,000
Hmm...can I do it in the British style? 'Water'.
'Water'.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,430
So, American English is more relaxed, and
tends to be spoken

32
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:37,129
with a wider mouth, using the lips less. British

33
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:45,129
English is tenser, more frontal, and uses
the lips a lot more.

34
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:53,290
What other effects does this have on pronunciation?
Think about the word phone.

35
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:58,819
This word has a diphthong: a double vowel
sound: /əʊ/.

36
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:05,720
In British English, this sound is produced
with fast, minimal movements. To sound British,

37
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:13,110
you should move your mouth as little as possible:
phone.

38
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:19,570
In American English, you need to relax your
jaw and move your mouth more. The sound is

39
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:29,910
longer, and the two parts of the vowel are
more distinct: phone.

40
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:36,560
You can find a similar difference in other
diphthongs. For example, think about the word

41
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,740
how.

42
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,870
When I say it,
my mouth is more relaxed and I move more compared

43
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,650
to a British English speaker.

44
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:56,500
Again, this means the sound is slightly longer,
and the two parts of the vowel sound are more

45
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:04,330
separated: how.

46
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,410
When I say how,
I produce the diphthong with a very small

47
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:14,300
movement of my lips. The movement is all near
the front of my mouth.

48
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,900
This produces a shorter, faster sound. The
two parts of the vowel sound aren’t very

49
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:29,890
distinct, because I’m moving through the
sound quickly: how.

50
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:36,350
You can see a similar difference with words
like train or rice, which also contain diphthongs:

51
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,800
/eɪ/ and /aɪ/.

52
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,930
In British English, the diphthongs are pronounced
with smaller movements, and the sounds are

53
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:51,580
shorter and faster: train, rice.

54
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:58,370
In American English, the vowels are pronounced
with the mouth more relaxed, the mouth moves

55
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:07,790
more, and the sounds are longer and more ‘separated’:
train, rice.

56
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:15,330
However, the differences in pronunciation
aren’t just in diphthongs. Some other vowel

57
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:22,229
sounds are also different in British and American
pronunciation.

58
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:27,919
For example, think about the word cat.

59
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,350
This word has an /æ/ vowel sound.

60
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:40,890
In American English, this is a diphthong.
You move your tongue through the sound, so

61
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:51,130
the vowel sound changes as you pronounce it:
cat.

62
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:57,160
In British English, the /æ/ sound isn’t
a diphthong. It’s a single sound. To pronounce

63
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,699
the sound with a British accent, again you
need to use more tension.

64
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,060
This is because you have to hold the sound
until you pronounce the following consonant.

65
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:17,270
You can’t relax into the consonant like
you can in American English: cat.

66
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,680
You have to hold the tension, which for this
sound is

67
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,530
near the throat in the back of the mouth:
cat.

68
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:33,340
I find the American /æ/ very difficult, and
while writing this script, I realized I can't

69
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:41,730
pronounce it at all: 'cat'. 'Cat'. Yeah, see?
Gina? Does that work both ways?

70
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:48,650
Let's see if I can do it in the British way.
I have to hold the vowel tense instead of

71
00:07:48,650 --> 00:08:03,300
relaxing into the consonant. Let's try: 'cat'.
'Cat'.

72
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,610
Some vowel sounds are just different, in that
words are pronounced with different vowel

73
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,070
sounds in British and American English.

74
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:17,770
This is particularly common with the vowels
/æ/, like the ‘a’ in cat, and /aː/,

75
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,370
like the ‘a’ in father.

76
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:26,600
Sometimes, words which have one sound in British
English will have the other sound in American

77
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
English.

78
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:35,050
For example, in British English, we say ban/ɑː/na,
sult/ɑː/na, keb/æ/b and las/æ/gne...

79
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:45,339
...But in American English, we would say ban/æ/na,
sult/æ/na, keb/ɑː/b and las/ɑː/gne…

80
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:50,399
The sounds are exactly opposite.

81
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:57,709
There are many, many differences between vowel
sounds in British and American pronunciation—too

82
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:04,800
many to list here! Let’s look at one more
important one:

83
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,500
There are many examples where the sounds /æ/
and /aː/ switch with the sound /eɪ/.

84
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:20,649
A famous example is the word tomato. It’s
pronounced with an /eɪ/ sound in American

85
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:22,459
English.

86
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:27,800
But in British English, it has an /ɑː/ sound:
tomato.

87
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:35,550
Other examples? B/æ/sil, appar/eɪ/tus, comr/eɪ/de
or /eɪ/pricot...

88
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:44,459
...While I would say: b/eɪ/sil, appar/æ/tus,
comr/æ/de and /æ/pricot

89
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,459


90
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,189
Okay, so that’s all for
vowel sounds.

91
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:57,649
Key points: American vowel sounds are often
longer and more relaxed than British vowel

92
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:05,869
sounds. Also, many words are pronounced with
different vowel sounds in British and American

93
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:08,499
English.

94
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:16,329
What about consonant sounds; are they also
different in British and American pronunciation?

95
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:21,819
Like with vowels, there are many differences
between consonants in British and American

96
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:22,920
pronunciation.

97
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:29,160
Let’s start with the two most important
differences. These relate to ‘r’ sounds

98
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,250
and ‘t’ sounds.

99
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:37,910
In British English, in words written with
a vowel + ‘r’, the ‘r’ is not normally

100
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:43,889
pronounced: car, nurse, horse.

101
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:52,779
In American English, these ‘r’ sounds
are pronounced: car, nurse, horse.

102
00:10:52,779 --> 00:11:02,620
Also, ‘r’ sounds at the end of a word
are pronounced. Look at this question:

103
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,420
Are there any more people over there?

104
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:14,429
In this question, every word has an ‘r’
sound at the end, except for any and people

105
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:17,069


106
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:21,910
Listen again. Can you hear the ‘r’ sounds?

107
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,579
Are there any more people over there?

108
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:31,339
In the UK, we pronounce ‘r’ at the end
of a word only if the next word starts with

109
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,850
a vowel:

110
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,440
Are there any more people over there?

111
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:43,920
I don’t pronounce ‘r’ sounds on are,
more, over or there. I pronounce

112
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,639
‘r’ on the first there because the next
word—any—starts with a vowel

113
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,839


114
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,730
Listen once more:

115
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,199
Are there any more people over there?

116
00:11:55,199 --> 00:12:02,139
So, ‘r’ sounds are one big difference
between British and American pronunciation.

117
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,959
What’s the other big difference? ‘T’
sounds.

118
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,359
Look at a sentence:

119
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:18,170
Betty’s daughter’s butter is better than
Tamara’s or Matt’s.

120
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:25,859
In American English, when you have a ‘t’
sound between two vowel sounds, the ‘t’

121
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:29,839
changes to a ‘d’ sound:

122
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:39,529
Be/d/y’s daugh/d/er’s bu/d/er is be/d/er
than Tamara’s or Matt’s.

123
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:47,579
What about the ‘t’ sounds in the names
Tamara and Matt? Do they change?

124
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:54,790
No, they’re pronounced normally. Why?

125
00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:08,470
Remember, the ‘t’ sound changes only if
it’s between two vowels. In other cases,

126
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,709
‘t’ is pronounced normally.

127
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:18,079
This doesn’t happen in British English.
To sound British, you should pronounce all

128
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,079
of the ‘t’ sounds:

129
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:25,350
Be/t/y’s daugh/t/er’s bu/t/er is be/t/er
than Tamara’s or Matt’s.

130
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,260


131
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:35,860
Those are the biggest differences with consonant
pronunciation, but we’ll look at one more.

132
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:45,490
Another difference is in words like Tuesday,
tutor, duty, or news.

133
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,480
What connects these words?

134
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:56,810
They all start with a consonant plus an /ʊː/
sound.

135
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:08,899
In American English, the pronunciation is
closer to the spelling: Tuesday, tutor, duty,

136
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:10,779
news.

137
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:15,309
So how’s it different in British pronunciation?

138
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:23,679
Listen and see if you can hear the difference:
Tuesday, tutor, duty, news.

139
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:31,709
There’s an extra sound there, which isn’t
in American pronunciation.

140
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:41,079
In British English, you need to add a /j/
before the /ʊː/ sound: Tuesday, tutor, duty,

141
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,279
news.

142
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:48,079
This happens when you have an /ʊː/ sound
after certain consonants, like /t/, /d/ or

143
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,079
/n/.

144
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:53,829
Okay, so now you know something about the
differences in the pronunciation of sounds

145
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:57,470
between American and British English?

146
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:06,299
Are there other important differences? Yes, there are.
There are also differences in word stress

147
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:10,970
between American and British English.

148
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:17,299
For example, listen to five words:

149
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:22,299
advertisement
inquiry

150
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:26,720
moustache
adult

151
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,160
translate

152
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,309
When I say them, where’s the stress?

153
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:38,920
Now, listen to Oli:

154
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,929
advertisement
inquiry

155
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:44,999
moustache
adult

156
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
translate

157
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,860
Where’s the stress when I pronounce them?
Can you hear the difference with Gina’s pronunciation?

158
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,140
Listen once more.

159
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:08,460
Advertisement, inquiry, moustache, adult, translate.

160
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,980
Can you hear the stresses? Here they are:

161
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:24,200
Now, listen to the British pronunciation one
more time. Try to hear where the stress is,

162
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,820
and how it’s different.

163
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,280

165

166
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,680
Can you hear?

167
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
Here are the stresses

168
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,799
As usual with word stress, there aren’t
really rules. However, it’s useful to know

169
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:50,439
that word stress can be different in American
and British English.

170
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:56,079
Let’s look at one more difference between
British and American pronunciation.

171
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,600
Do you know this sound?

172
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,750
It’s a schwa. It’s common in both British
and American English.

173
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:12,230
However, in British English, other vowel sounds
reduce to a schwa sound much more often than

174
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,639
in American English.

175
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:18,339
What do I mean by ‘reduce?’

176
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,980
Look at five words:

177
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:28,039
In British English, all of these words have
at least one schwa sound. Can you hear where

178
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:39,009
it is? Strawberry, ordinary, innovative, category, ceremony.

179
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:44,420
Now listen to Gina and see if you can hear
the difference:

180
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,900
strawb/e/rry
ordin/eə/ry

181
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,640
innov/eɪ/tive
categ/ɔ/ry

182
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,200
cerem/əʊ/ny

183
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:02,500
Can you hear the difference? In British English,
the ‘e’ in strawberry is pronounced with

184
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:10,430
a schwa sound. The ‘full’ vowel sound
is reduced to a schwa.

185
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:19,750
However, in American English, we pronounce
the vowel with its full sound: /e/.

186
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:28,490
Listen to the five words one more time. Pay
attention to the highlighted vowel sounds:

187
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:33,280
strawb/e/rry
ordin/eə/ry

188
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,070
innov/eɪ/tive
categ/ɔ/ry

189
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,460
cerem/əʊ/ny

190
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:51,450
Now, listen to Oli one more time. Hear how
British English reduces these vowels to schwa

191
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,130
sounds:

192
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,980
strawb/ə/rry
ordin/ə/ry

193
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,880
innov/ə/tive
categ/ə/ry

194
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,559
cerem/ə/ny

195
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,790
Can you hear it now?

196
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:10,620
This reduction is more common in British English,
but sometimes it goes the other way, too.

197
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:17,960
If a word ends –ile, like fragile or mobile,
then the ‘i’ vowel will have its full

198
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,230
vowel pronunciation in British English.

199
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:32,730
In American English, the ‘i’ can be reduced
to a schwa sound: frag/ə/le, mob/ə/le.

200
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:44,580
The same is true for other words ending in
–ile, like hostile or volatile.

201
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:50,970
So now, you’ve learned about differences
between British and American pronunciation

202
00:19:50,970 --> 00:20:01,060
with vowel sounds, consonants, word stress
and vowel reductions.

203
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,820
Do you know any other differences in pronunciation

204
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:10,160
between American and British English?
