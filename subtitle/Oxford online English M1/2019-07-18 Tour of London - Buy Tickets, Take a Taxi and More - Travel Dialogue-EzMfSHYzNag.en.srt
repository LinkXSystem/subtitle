00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,500
Hi, my name’s Olivier.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,060
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,350
Let’s take a tour of London.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,080
Have you been to London before?

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,230
If so, what did you do?

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,060
If not, what would you most like to see?

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,180
In this lesson, you’ll go on a tour of London.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,090
You’ll learn useful language to deal with
common tourist situations, like buying tickets,

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,940
going to museums or talking to taxi drivers.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:38,420
Before we start, don’t forget to check out
our website: Oxford Online English dot com.

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,280
We have many free lessons to help you practise
and improve your English, and you can also

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,010
study in one-to-one classes with one of our
professional teachers.

13
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:54,680
But now, here’s an interesting fact: last
year, London was the second most visited city

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,320
anywhere in the world, with nearly 20 million
visitors.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,930
Which city do you think was number one?

16
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:06,720
Don’t cheat by looking it up; we’ll tell
you at the end of the video.

17
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,680
Anyway, don’t worry about that for now.

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,000
Let’s take a tour of London.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,180
Where shall we go first?

20
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,080
Hi, good morning.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,140
Hi.

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,450
Can I help you?

23
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,560
My friends and I are thinking of doing your
bus tour tomorrow.

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,260
Could you tell me more about the route and
where we’ll go?

25
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,530
Actually, we offer many different routes.

26
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,620
Is there anything in particular you’d like
to see?

27
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:38,310
Well, I think we want the classic London experience:
Big Ben, the Tower of London, and so on.

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,850
In that case I’d recommend our original
route.

29
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,580
It starts and ends at Grosvenor Gardens, just
near Buckingham Palace.

30
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,410
You’ll cross the river by the Houses of
Parliament, then back again near the London

31
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,410
Eye.

32
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:56,450
You’ll also go past the Tower of London,
St Paul’s Cathedral, and several other London

33
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,840
landmarks.

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,030
That sounds good.

35
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,259
How long does it take?

36
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:05,450
The whole route takes about two hours, but
it’s a hop on-hop off tour, so you can get

37
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,420
off wherever you want.

38
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,000
And how much are tickets?

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,170
If you book online, they’re 25 pounds each,
or 35 if you buy from the driver.

40
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,420
Do you do any kind of group discount?

41
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,550
We offer a family ticket, which includes two
adults and two children.

42
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,280
I’m travelling with friends, so I guess
that’s no good.

43
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,570
I just have one more question: is there a
guide, or an audio guide?

44
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,099
There’s a live guide, who speaks English.

45
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:37,260
If any of your group want a tour in another
language, we have audio guides available in

46
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,200
11 different languages at no extra cost.

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,260
That sounds great.

48
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,670
Thanks for your help!

49
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:49,660
First question: can you name five famous London
landmarks?

50
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,160
If you don’t know, ‘landmarks’ means
famous places.

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,470
For example, the Eiffel Tower is possibly
the best-known Paris landmark.

52
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,569
So, can you name five London landmarks?

53
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:05,320
You heard several examples in the dialogue.

54
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:13,640
Here are the examples you heard before: Buckingham
Palace, the Houses of Parliament, the London

55
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,410
Eye, the Tower of London and St Paul’s Cathedral.

56
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:26,120
You could mention others, like Marble Arch,
Trafalgar Square, Hyde Park, or famous football

57
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,920
stadia like The Emirates or Wembley.

58
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,440
In the dialogue, I was asking questions about
a bus tour of the city.

59
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,750
Can you remember any of the questions I asked?

60
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:47,240
You heard: ‘Could you tell me more about
the route and where we’ll go?’

61
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,920
‘How long does it take?’

62
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,500
‘How much are tickets?’

63
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,709
‘Do you do any kind of group discount?’

64
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:03,640
‘Is there a guide, or an audio guide?’

65
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,940
You could ask these questions in many common
travel situations; they aren’t only useful

66
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,330
when booking a tour bus!

67
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,370
For example, you could make questions like
this: ‘Could you tell me more about the

68
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,789
tour, and what’s included?’

69
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:23,400
‘How much is the transport?’

70
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,969
‘Do you do any kind of student discounts?’

71
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:33,499
The bus tour we were talking about is ‘hop
on/hop off’.

72
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:38,490
This means you can get off the bus to visit
places on the way, and then get back on another

73
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,289
bus later.

74
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:49,060
Let’s make our first stop, and go to one
of London’s famous museums.

75
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,379
Good morning, welcome to the Tate Modern.

76
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:52,379
Good morning.

77
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,119
I’d like four tickets please.

78
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:58,860
Actually, general admission to the Tate modern
is free; you just have to pay separately for

79
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,860
the exhibitions.

80
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,860
Oh…

81
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,860
Great!

82
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,860
I didn’t realise that.

83
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,280
What do you have on at the moment?

84
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,699
We have a wonderful Picasso exhibition, which
I’d highly recommend.

85
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,800
We also have exhibitions by Franz West and
Dorothea Tanning.

86
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,770
I’d love to see the Picasso exhibition.

87
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,770
How much are the tickets?

88
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,479
They’re eighteen pounds for adults and five
pounds for children under 18.

89
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,819
We also have a 7-year-old with us.

90
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:25,909
Do we need a ticket for him?

91
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,250
No, under-12s get in free.

92
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,099
OK, so two adults and one child then, please.

93
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,350
What time would you like the ticket for?

94
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,379
Excuse me?

95
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:40,990
With exhibitions, especially popular ones
like the Picasso, your ticket is for a specific

96
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,990
time.

97
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,720
There’s a 30-minute slot, and you have to
enter the exhibition hall within that time.

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,610
You mean, I only get 30 minutes to look around?!

99
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,190
That’s not long enough!

100
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,190
No, no!

101
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,409
You can stay as long as you like; it just
regulates when you can go in.

102
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:58,539
I see!

103
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:00,629
In that case, what times are available?

104
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,669
Well, it’s 10.45 now.

105
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:07,979
I could give you tickets for the eleven to
eleven-thirty entrance slot.

106
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,309
That’s fine.

107
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:11,310
That’s £36, please.

108
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,310
Do you take euros?

109
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,530
I’m afraid not.

110
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,780
I’ll pay by card, then.

111
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,990
Do you like going to art galleries or museums?

112
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,430
Which London museums have you heard of?

113
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:29,630
The Tate Modern, which you heard about in
the dialogue, is a famous modern art museum.

114
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:36,979
There are many other well-known London museums,
such as the British Museum, the National Gallery,

115
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,149
or the Natural History Museum.

116
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,539
For now, let’s look at some useful language
from the dialogue.

117
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:50,999
Near the beginning, you heard this question:
‘What do you have on at the moment?’

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,940
Do you know what this means?

119
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:02,139
‘On’ refers to an event, performance,
or exhibition which is happening now.

120
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:07,089
You can use it in different situations; for
example, at the cinema:

121
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:12,610
‘What films are on at the moment?’

122
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,059
At the theatre: ‘Are there any good plays
on?’

123
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:25,589
Or, at a museum: ‘There’s a really interesting
exhibition on at the Science Museum.’

124
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:31,110
You also heard some more useful questions
related to buying tickets; for example: ‘Do

125
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,540
we need a ticket for him?’

126
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,160
‘What times are available?’

127
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,860
‘Do you take euros?’

128
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:46,939
Like much of the language in this lesson,
you can adapt these for different situations,

129
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,780
like this: ‘Do we need a ticket for my son?’

130
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,040
‘What kind of rooms are available?’

131
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:02,200
‘Do you take dollars?’

132
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,159
Hi, how can I help you?

133
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:05,349
Hello!

134
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:09,379
We haven’t planned this very well, but we
decided this morning we wanted to see a show

135
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:14,120
while we are here, and thought it might be
possible to get some cheap last-minute tickets.

136
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,889
Any idea of what you want to see?

137
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:19,389
No, I don’t even know what’s on right
now, actually.

138
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:23,610
Well, were you thinking a musical, or a play?

139
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,530
I think… a musical.

140
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,139
It’ll be more fun for the kids.

141
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,330
Here, take a look at this.

142
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,479
These are the musicals we have on at the moment.

143
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,870
I really don’t know.

144
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,990
Can you recommend something?

145
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,089
How old are your children?

146
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,089
Five and nine.

147
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:42,240
I think the Lion King would be perfect.

148
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,490
It’s one of our longest running shows, and
it’s good fun.

149
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,399
That sounds perfect!

150
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,569
How much are the tickets?

151
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:53,459
Well, first of all, what time would you like
to go?

152
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,540
We have matinee and evening tickets available.

153
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,089
The matinee tickets are slightly cheaper.

154
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:00,310
What time is the matinee?

155
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,110
It’s at two-thirty, so in about an hour.

156
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,209
The evening performance is at seven-thirty.

157
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:08,750
Two-thirty is too soon.

158
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,730
I guess it’ll have to be the evening.

159
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,310
OK, evening it is.

160
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,579
The second question is: where would you like
to sit?

161
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,540
You can choose from stalls, Royal Circle or
Grand Circle.

162
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,380
Take a look at this seating plan.

163
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,380
Hmm…

164
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,660
We’re kind of on a budget.

165
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,190
Which tickets are the cheapest?

166
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,300
You could sit in the Grand Circle, near the
back.

167
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,560
We have four seats together, just here.

168
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
How much would they be?

169
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,579
Normally, they’re eighty pounds each, but
because it’s last minute, they’re down

170
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:38,579
to forty-five.

171
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,579
Is it cheaper for children?

172
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,209
No, I’m afraid not.

173
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:43,800
All tickets are the same price.

174
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,209
Alright, I guess we won’t get another chance
anytime soon.

175
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:49,399
We’ll take them!

176
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,180
Look at five words and phrases which you heard
in the dialogue.

177
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,380
They’re all connected with going to the
theatre.

178
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,200
Do you know what these words mean?

179
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,820
How would you explain the meaning?

180
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,649
If you’re on a budget, you might want to
look for last-minute tickets.

181
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,779
You might buy last-minute tickets close to the time
of the show you want to see.

182
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,670
Last-minute tickets are often cheaper.

183
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:23,810
You can use ‘last-minute’ to talk about
other things as well; for example, last-minute

184
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,490
plane tickets, or a last-minute hotel booking.

185
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:34,840
A musical is a play—or a film—which includes
songs and dancing routines.

186
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,139
Can you think of any other famous musicals?

187
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:44,839
A ‘matinee’ is a performance which starts
earlier in the day, usually in the afternoon.

188
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:50,580
You can also use the word ‘matinee’ to
talk about films at the cinema.

189
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,380
A typical theatre has two types of seating:
stalls and circle.

190
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,070
The stalls are the seats in front of the stage,
and at the same level.

191
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,550
The circle is higher and further back, so
seats in the circle tend to be cheaper.

192
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,910
Now, you’ve been looking around London all
day, and you’re feeling tired.

193
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:17,460
It’s time to jump in a taxi and go back
to your hotel.

194
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,040
Where to?

195
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,370
Excuse me?

196
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,370
Where are you going?

197
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,490
Oh, sorry.

198
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,209
Trafalgar Square, please.

199
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:25,630
Do you know how much it will be?

200
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,330
It’s all on the meter, but should be around
£25.

201
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,720
OK, that’s fine.

202
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,480
How’s your day going?

203
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,279
Typical Saturday, innit?

204
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,600
Very busy, but can’t complain.

205
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,180
Are you just here visiting?

206
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,879
Yeah, I’m from the US.

207
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,279
Are you from London originally?

208
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,279
Yep.

209
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,660
Proper Londoner.

210
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,370
Born and bred here.

211
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,019
So, you like it here?

212
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,020
It’s a blinding place to live.

213
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,700
Oh, right.

214
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,779
Obviously there a few places that are a little
dodgy, but I think you get that in any big

215
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:56,779
city.

216
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:57,790
Of course.

217
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:03,430
I mean, it just does my nut when people talk
about how dangerous London has become.

218
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,430
Well…

219
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,430
Yes…

220
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,100
I mean you’ve got to say the old bill do
a good job around here.

221
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,100
The old who?

222
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,100
The old bill.

223
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,360
That’s what we call the police here.

224
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,930
Ah… actually could you drop me off here?

225
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,800
I’d like to walk down The Mall.

226
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,779
Yeah, no problem.

227
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:23,439
That’s 25 quid please.

228
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:26,949
If you didn’t understand all of that, don’t
worry.

229
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:34,230
We included some colloquial words and phrases
that are typical in London.

230
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,120
Have you heard any of these before?

231
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,860
‘Innit’ is used instead of question tags
like ‘are you?’ or ‘doesn’t it?’

232
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:50,439
For example, instead of ‘The weather looks
nice, doesn’t it?’ you might hear ‘The

233
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:53,600
weather looks nice, innit?’

234
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,010
This is colloquial, and as an English learner
you probably shouldn’t use it, but you might

235
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,399
hear it in the UK.

236
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:06,009
‘Blinding’ is a slang word which means
‘very good’.

237
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:11,520
On the other hand, something which is ‘dodgy’
is not good at all.

238
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,180
‘Dodgy’ means that something is wrong.

239
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:20,529
If you describe a person as dodgy, you mean
that this person shouldn’t be trusted.

240
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:25,139
If you talk about a dodgy area of a city,
you’re talking about an area which isn’t

241
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,949
always safe to walk around.

242
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:32,160
If something ‘does your nut’, it annoys
you.

243
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,519
For example, you could say ‘This music really
does my nut.’

244
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,649
Again, this is very colloquial!

245
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:46,199
Use it for fun if you want, but expect people
to give you some strange looks.

246
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:49,740
The ‘old bill’, as you heard, are the
police.

247
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,420
This is London-specific slang.

248
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,920
Finally, ‘quid’ is another word for ‘pounds’.

249
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,240
This is common, and you’ll probably hear
it if you visit the UK.

250
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:07,439
So, if something costs ten pounds, you can
say that it costs ten quid instead.

251
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:14,319
‘Quid’ is too colloquial to use in writing;
also, ‘quid’ doesn’t change in the plural:

252
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:17,199
one quid, two quid, three quid…

253
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,240
Anyway, we hope you feel ready for a trip
to London now!

254
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,079
Do you have any recommendations for things
to do in London?

255
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,519
Please share your ideas in the comments!

256
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,519
Thanks for…..

257
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,640
Hang on….you promised you would tell me
what was the number one most visited city

258
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,870
in 2018!

259
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,329
Oh yes, I completely forgot.

260
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:39,589
What do you think?

261
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:48,459
Which city was visited more than London last
year, to make it the number one?

262
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:53,790
It was actually Bangkok, with almost 21 million
visitors.

263
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,009
Well, you learn something new every day.

264
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:58,319
Thanks for watching!

265
00:14:58,319 --> 00:14:59,009
See you next time!
