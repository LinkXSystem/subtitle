1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,160
Oh…

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,020
Hello!

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,940
Ah…

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,500
I should have prepared for this lesson, I
guess.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,970
Now I don’t know what to say.

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,260
Whoops!

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,540
Martin!

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,710
You could have at least warned me.

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,170
Now what are we going to do?

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,450
I would have done it, but I was just so busy…

11
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,220
I could have done it if you’d told me.

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,090
Don’t you have some notes, or something
we can use?

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,470
I had some notes, but I can’t find them.

14
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,720
Well, think about it: where could they be?

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,880
Not sure…

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,210
I could have left them on the bus.

17
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,840
I should never have agreed to do this video…

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,960
Hi, I’m Martin.

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,359
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

20
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:08,800
In this lesson, you can learn how to use would
have, should have and could have.

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:15,420
These verbs—would, should, could, etc.—are
modal verbs, so they don’t have past forms

22
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,350
like normal verbs do.

23
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:25,020
Instead, you can talk about the past by adding
have plus a past participle after the verb.

24
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:31,039
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use
those modal verbs to talk about the past in

25
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:36,829
English, what they mean, and how they’re
different.

26
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:44,609
Sometimes, you have moments when your life
could go in very different ways.

27
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:52,549
For example, maybe you take an important exam,
and your result decides where you can go to

28
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:54,950
university.

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,450
Maybe you’re thinking about moving to another
country.

30
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,420
Do you stay where you are, or do you leave?

31
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:11,720
Perhaps you’re in a relationship and things
aren’t going so well.

32
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:18,330
Do you stay and try to make it work, or do
you move on?

33
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,330
Life is full of these important moments and
decisions.

34
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,430
Try to think of something like this from your
past.

35
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,420
Now, ask yourself: you made the choices you
made.

36
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:37,020
You passed the exam, or you failed it; you
moved to another country, or you didn’t.

37
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,380
That’s reality, but what if things had gone
the other way?

38
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,380
This is the imaginary past.

39
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,100
You’re imagining a different version of
the past.

40
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,450
You’re asking yourself questions like:

41
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,280
What if I had worked a bit harder, and passed
that exam?

42
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,160
What if I had taken that job, and moved to
Italy?

43
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,560
What if I had told her how I feel?

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,480
This is where you use would have.

45
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,790
Use would have to talk about the imaginary
past.

46
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,420
For example:

47
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:19,260
If I had got better exam results, I would
have got into Harvard.

48
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,290
I wouldn’t have met my wife if I had moved
to Italy seven years ago.

49
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:31,130
If I hadn’t forgotten my pen that day, I
wouldn’t have asked to borrow yours, and

50
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,860
we wouldn’t have become friends!

51
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:42,810
Think about your important moment from the
past, when your life could have gone in two

52
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:51,010
very different directions: what would have
happened if things had gone the other way?

53
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:57,040
So, you can use would have to talk about the
imaginary past.

54
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,100
What about our other verbs?

55
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,520
Where do you suppose they are?

56
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,680
I don’t know.

57
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,760
They’re usually so reliable.

58
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,460
I guess they could have mixed up the date?

59
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,180
Shall we try calling them again?

60
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,000
We can’t wait forever.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,310
When will it be ready?

62
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,530
I think next Thursday.

63
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:28,820
You said you’d have it finished by the end
of this week!

64
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,860
Now what am I going to do?

65
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,460
Sorry.

66
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:39,760
You could have told me sooner that you weren’t
going to finish on time.

67
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,260
Doctor, is it serious?

68
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,660
No, it’s just a scratch, but be more careful
next time.

69
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,820
You could have really hurt yourself!

70
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,580
You can also use could have to talk about the imaginary past:

71
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,080
If I’d had more time, I could have finished everything.

72
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,500
He could have won it if he hadn’t slipped at the start.

73
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:13,900
When you use could have to talk about the imaginary past, you’re talking about possibilities.

74
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:21,180
You’re talking about opportunities and chances which you didn’t have in reality,

75
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:28,400
but in your imaginary version of the past, you would have had these chances.

76
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,120
However, could have can also have different meanings. Let’s look:

77
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,560
Here, you saw three more ways to use could
have.

78
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,680
Remember that you can go back and review the
dialogues if you need to.

79
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:51,010
Can you explain how could have is used in
each of these dialogues?

80
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:56,750
Could have can mean that you aren’t sure
about something in the past.

81
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,450
You’re talking about a possibility:

82
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,180
They could have mixed up the date.

83
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,980
I’ve lost my keys.

84
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,700
I could have left them at work.

85
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,410
Where are they?

86
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,360
I guess they could have missed the train.

87
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:21,630
In these examples, you aren’t sure about
something that happened in the past.

88
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:27,310
You use could have to make a guess about what
happened.

89
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,200
You can also use could have to criticise someone:

90
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,200
You could have told me sooner.

91
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,230
You could have tidied up a bit.

92
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,660
You could have worn something a bit nicer.

93
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:48,020
In these examples, you want to criticise the
other person for something they didn’t do.

94
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:55,580
Finally, you can use could have to mean that
somebody was lucky to avoid a bad situation

95
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,580
in the past:

96
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,020
It’s just a scratch, but you could have
really hurt yourself.

97
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:10,140
We were really late, and we could have missed
our plane, but luckily we just made it.

98
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,600
Let’s review quickly.

99
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,010
Could have has four different meanings.

100
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,350
Can you remember them?

101
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,199
You can use could have to talk about the imaginary
past,

102
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,080
to guess about something in the past which
you aren’t sure about,

103
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,510
to criticise someone for something they didn’t
do,

104
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,290
and to say that someone was lucky to avoid
a bad situation.

105
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:44,870
Next, what about should have?

106
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:51,590
You just saw that could have can be used to
criticise someone.

107
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:57,760
Should have is similar, but you can use it
in a wider variety of ways.

108
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,070
Like could have, you can use it to criticise
something that someone didn’t do in the

109
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,840
past:

110
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,850
You should have called me like you promised.

111
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:16,190
He should have checked the recipe before he
started cooking.

112
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,850
They should have practiced penalties
before the match.

113
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,350
You can also use it to criticise something
that someone did:

114
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,260
You shouldn’t have drunk so much at the
wedding!

115
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,440
She shouldn’t have left everything to the
last minute.

116
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,769
You can even use it to criticise yourself,
if you regret something which you did in the

117
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,689
past:

118
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:44,050
I should have realised what was going on.

119
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,640
I shouldn’t have said that.

120
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,749
You can also use should have to apologise
to someone.

121
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:56,959
If you say I shouldn’t have said that, you’re
admitting that you made the wrong choice,

122
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,619
and that you regret it.

123
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:05,860
This is the most common use of should have:
criticising others or yourself, and talking

124
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,790
about things you regret in the past.

125
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,079
However, it has one more meaning.

126
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:15,510
Look at three examples.

127
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:20,240
Can you work out what should have means here?

128
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:28,420
Here, you use should have to talk about something
which you expected to happen, but it didn’t

129
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,320
happen.

130
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:37,100
They should have been here by now means that
you expected them to have arrived before now,

131
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,249
but you’re still waiting.

132
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:48,560
It should have been ready an hour ago means
that you expected everything to be ready earlier.

133
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,459
Maybe you’re cooking something, and it’s
taking much longer than you thought it would.

134
00:09:54,459 --> 00:10:02,220
The plane should have landed at seven thirty
means that you expected the plane to land

135
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,670
then, but it didn’t.

136
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,939
Probably, you mean that the plane is late,
and you’re still waiting for it.

137
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:15,720
Now, you should have learned two different
ways to use should have.

138
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:25,990
Let’s practice using would have, could have
and should have together.

139
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,779
You should have told me your friends were
coming!

140
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:30,949
I would have made some extra food.

141
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:32,089
Sorry!

142
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,660
I would have called you, but I had no phone
credit.

143
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,880
I should have topped up before we went out.

144
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,589
What are we going to eat?

145
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:43,230
We don’t have much in the fridge.

146
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,509
I should have stopped and got a takeaway on
the way.

147
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:49,010
Not to worry: we’ll order something.

148
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,610
Where’s the food?

149
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,449
I’m so hungry!

150
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:54,339
They should have come by now, right?

151
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:56,540
They’re probably just busy.

152
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,339
They could have forgotten.

153
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,920
They would have called if there was a problem,
don’t you think?

154
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,200
Relax!

155
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,160
You should have had a snack when you got in.

156
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,880
It’ll be here soon.

157
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:09,999
That was delicious!

158
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:12,269
I’ve never had such a good meal.

159
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:14,389
You could have left some for me.

160
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:15,760
What am I supposed to eat?

161
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
Oh…

162
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,920
I’m sorry!

163
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,019
I would have left some if I’d known you
wanted some.

164
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,490
I should have asked.

165
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,920
Yeah, you should have.

166
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,600
Oh well, there’s half a cucumber in the
fridge, I think.

167
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,850
Look at three sentences from the dialogues.

168
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,020
Can you explain what they mean?

169
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,680
The first sentence is talking about the imaginary
past.

170
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,460
It means that if I had known you were bringing
guests, I would have made some more food.

171
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:56,769
But, in reality, I didn’t know, so I didn’t
make enough food.

172
00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:03,230
The second sentence is talking about something
you aren’t sure about in the past.

173
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,129
Do you remember the situation?

174
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:08,410
We were waiting for our takeaway to arrive.

175
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,720
It was late, and we didn’t know what
happened.

176
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,440
You use could have here to make a guess about
something in the past when you don’t know

177
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,000
what happened.

178
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,870
The third sentence is a criticism, or an expression
of regret.

179
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,829
If you say this, you mean that you made a
mistake in the past.

180
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:33,870
Think back to the dialogues.

181
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:40,670
Did we use should have or could have in any
other ways?

182
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,730
Look at two more sentences:

183
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,930
They should have come by now.

184
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,189
You could have left some for me.

185
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:55,040
What do should have and could have mean here?

186
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,990
Here, should have means that something didn’t
happen the way you expected.

187
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:07,249
You expected the food to be here by now, but
it isn’t.

188
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:12,610
Could have is used to criticise something
which someone else didn’t do.

189
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:20,089
Now, hopefully you understand how to use would
have, could have and should have.
