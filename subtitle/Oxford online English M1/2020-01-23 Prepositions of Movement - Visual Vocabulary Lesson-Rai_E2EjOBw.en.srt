them.

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,720
Now, let’s look at how to use prepositions
of movement in English.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,320
‘Around’ can have two different meanings.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:07,480
First, ‘around’ can mean ‘in a circle’
The train is going around the track.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,180
‘The earth revolves around its axis.’

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,219
‘Around’ can also mean ‘in different
directions’.

20
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:22,590
For example, if you say ‘we walked around
the city centre’, you mean that you walked

21
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,210
to different parts of the centre.

22
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,100
Here’s another example.

23
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:34,079
He looked around to check that everything
seemed OK.

24
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,799
He looked *around*, so he looked in different
directions.

25
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:45,340
Left, right, up, and so on.

26
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:52,120
‘Along’ means ‘in a straight line’
plus ‘parallel to’ something.

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,520
She’s walking along the stream.

28
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,400
The woman walked along the street.

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,100
He’s cycling along the road.

30
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:13,940
Instead of ‘along’ you can often use ‘up’
or ‘down’ instead in conversational English.

31
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,610
For example, instead of ‘He’s cycling
along the road’, you could say ‘He’s

32
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,310
cycling up the road,’ or ‘He’s cycling
down the road.’

33
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,620
Confusingly, ‘up’ and ‘down’ often
mean exactly the same thing!

34
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,450
Sometimes, there’s a small difference.

35
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:35,040
‘Up’ can mean ‘towards you’
and ‘down’ can mean ‘away from you’

36
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,680
So, these two sentences…
…*could* mean the same thing.

37
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,360
They could also be different.

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,320
The first sentence – with ‘up’ – could
mean that she’s walking towards you, and

39
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:56,850
the second sentence – with ‘down’ – could
mean that she’s walking away from you.

40
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,850
The couple walked under the bridge.

41
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,620
She passed under the fallen tree.

42
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,340
‘Under’ is similar to ‘below’, but
not exactly the same.

43
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,000
Do you know the difference?

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,240
‘Below’ means that you stay underneath
something.

45
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,590
‘Under’ – as a preposition of movement
– means that you pass from one side of something

46
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,180
to another
So, if you’re talking about movement, ‘under’

47
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,880
is more common.

48
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,100
You could say ‘the couple walked below the
bridge.’

49
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,650
It’s grammatically correct, but it’s also
strange.

50
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,440
Do you know why?

51
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,610
‘The couple walked below the bridge’ means
they stayed in the area underneath the bridge,

52
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:53,020
so the bridge was over their heads the whole
time when they were walking.

53
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,900
‘Over’ is the direct opposite of ‘under’.

54
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,850
The plane flew right over our heads.

55
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:09,110
She vaulted over the bar.

56
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,400
The direct opposite of ‘below’ is ‘above’.

57
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,640
The difference between ‘over’ and ‘above’
is the same as the difference between ‘under’

58
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,860
and ‘below’.

59
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,930
‘Across’ means from one side of something
to the other.

60
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:34,409
When the light turned green, they walked across
the street.

61
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:39,830
We walked across a narrow wooden bridge.

62
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,910
When you use ‘across’, there normally
isn’t anything above you.

63
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,860
Use it for open spaces.

64
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:53,550
For closed spaces, do you know which preposition
to use?

65
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,020
He walked through the door.

66
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,479
We drove through the tunnel.

67
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,220
The boat travelled through the swamp.

68
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:13,720
Sometimes, both ‘through’ and ‘across’
are possible; you can say ‘The boat travelled

69
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:16,479
through the swamp’ or ‘…across the swamp.’

70
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,680
The meaning is similar, but there could be
a small difference.

71
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,159
Do you know?

72
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:28,340
‘Through’ means that you enter and then
exit something.

73
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,879
If you drive *through* a tunnel, you first
drive into the tunnel, and then you drive

74
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,180
out of it.

75
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,999
If the boat travels *through* the swamp, it
moves into the swamp, then later moves out

76
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:40,460
of it.

77
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,479
‘Across’ means that you start on one side,
and finish on the opposite side.

78
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,009
If you say ‘the boat travelled across the
swamp’, you mean that it entered the swamp

79
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:55,130
on one side, and exited on the other side.

80
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,729
You can use both ‘across’ and ‘through’
with large, open spaces, especially natural

81
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:05,919
spaces: fields, parks, gardens, cities, and
so on.

82
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,780
When you can use both, ‘across’ has a
more specific meaning than ‘through’.

83
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,900
Both mean that you entered a space and then
exited it, but ‘across’ also tells you

84
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,560
*where* you exited.

85
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:28,360
‘Towards’ means that you approach something;
you get closer to something.

86
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,700
He walked towards the plane.

87
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,500
She’s walking towards the sea.

88
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,480
They’re walking towards the lighthouse.

89
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,560
The opposite of ‘towards’ is ‘away from’.

90
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,800
Here’s a question: what’s the difference
between these two?

91
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:57,559
Both mean that they *approached* the lighthouse,
but they’re slightly different.

92
00:06:57,559 --> 00:07:00,089
‘Towards’ tells you a direction.

93
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:04,099
‘Up to’ tells you a final result.

94
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:08,189
If they walked *towards* the lighthouse, they
got closer to it.

95
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:14,080
You don’t know where they started or finished,
but you know that they got closer to the lighthouse.

96
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,159
If they walked *up to* the lighthouse, then
they reached the lighthouse; they ended up

97
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:20,990
next to the lighthouse.

98
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:28,760
In this case, you don’t know where they
started, but do you know where they finished.

99
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,540
‘Into’ has two common meanings as a preposition
of movement.

100
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,100
First, it can mean to enter.

101
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,020
He dived into the water.

102
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,389
She came into the office.

103
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:47,379
‘Into’ can also mean to collide with something.

104
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:51,849
The cars crashed into each other.

105
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:57,680
The opposite of ‘into’ – meaning ‘enter’–
is ‘out of’.

106
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,949
She took the instruments out of the cupboard.

107
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:12,300
He got out of his car to fill it up with petrol.

108
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:20,280
I was walking past the café when I saw my
friend sitting inside.

109
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,189
The two women walked past the parking garage.

110
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:30,409
If you walk past something – for example
a house – you start with the house in front

111
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:39,040
of you, you walk *past* the house, and then
the house is behind you.

112
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,960
‘Up’ and ‘down’ have two common meanings
as prepositions of movement.

113
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,720
First, you have the basic meaning: to a higher
or lower

114
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,040
position.

115
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,860
She’s walking up the hill.

116
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,720
When we let go of the lanterns, they flew
up into the sky.

117
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,910
He walked down the stairs while talking on
the phone.

118
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,310
The roller coaster accelerated down a steep
drop.

119
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:15,120
You saw earlier that ‘up’ or ‘down’
can also have the same meaning as ‘along’.

120
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,760
That’s all for this lesson.

121
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,640
Thanks for watching!
