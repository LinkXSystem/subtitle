00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,690
Hi, I’m Marie.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,660
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:10,860
In this lesson, you can learn about a pronunciation
feature which can help you to understand fast

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,690
speech and also talk more fluently in English.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,100
What is this pronunciation feature?

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,440
It’s called ‘elision’.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:29,199
Elision is when some words or parts of a word
are not pronounced.

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:36,570
For example, a letter might not be pronounced,
or a syllable might disappear, or sometimes

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,880
even whole words are not pronounced fully.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:49,780
Elision is common in spoken English, especially
in fast, informal speech.

11
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:55,430
Learning about elision will help your listening
and—if you can use it yourself—help your

12
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,440
speaking, too!

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,100
Before we start, don’t forget to visit our
website: Oxford Online English dot com.

of our many professional English teachers.

16
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:23,090
But now, let’s look at the first way to
use elision.

17
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,850
In some words, especially words with three
or more syllables, an unstressed syllable

18
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,040
can disappear.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,700
Here’s an example: comfortable.

20
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,720
Comfortable.

21
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,580
Can you hear what’s happening?

22
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:50,520
The ‘o-r’ after ‘f’ *could* be pronounced
with a schwa sound: com-/fə/-table.

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,139
But, it often isn’t pronounced at all.

24
00:01:55,139 --> 00:02:01,579
You link directly from the ‘f’ to the
‘t’: comfortable.

25
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,100
Try it after me: comfortable.

26
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,620
Let’s do one more example together: restaurant.

27
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,620
Restaurant.

28
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,140
Restaurant.

29
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,860
Can you hear which syllable is missing?

30
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,900
The ‘a-u’ is often not pronounced,

31
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,460
so you can link directly from the ‘t’ to the ‘r’: restaurant

32
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,740
Look at five more words.

33
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,700
In each of these words, one syllable is often
not pronounced.

34
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,500
Can you see which syllable can disappear?

35
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,360
Pause the video if you want more time to think.

36
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,300
Ready?

37
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,060
Let’s look together.

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,500
In ‘history’, the ‘o’ is often not
pronounced: history.

39
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,800
History.

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,200
In ‘temperature’, the second ‘e’,
after the ‘p’, is often not pronounced.

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,900
So, you can link from the ‘p’ to the ‘r’:
temperature.

42
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:18,460
In ‘vegetable’, the second ‘e’ can
disappear: vegetable.

43
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,160
Vegetable.

44
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:27,480
In ‘chocolate’, the second ‘o’ is
not generally pronounced: chocolate.

45
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,240
Chocolate.

46
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,640
Finally, in ‘different’, the first ‘e’
almost always disappears, so you link directly

47
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,820
from ‘f’ to ‘r’: different.

48
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,859
Different.

49
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,620
How did you do?

50
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,340
Could you find the disappearing syllables?

51
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,469
Can you pronounce the words with the elision?

52
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:01,660
Go back and repeat this section if you want
more practice.

53
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:09,340
At this point, you probably have some questions,
like “Is there any way to know which words

54
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,470
have disappearing syllables?”

55
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:17,169
And, “Do I need to speak like this all the
time?”

56
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:21,680
The first question has a simple answer: basically,
no.

57
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,190
However, there aren’t that many words where
this happens.

58
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:33,070
If you practise the pronunciation of the words
in this section, that’s a good start.

59
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,970
The second question is more important.

60
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,550
With all elision, there isn’t one ‘correct’
way to say something.

61
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:45,610
Also, different speakers pronounce things
in different ways.

62
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:55,460
So, you might hear some people pronounce ‘comfortable’
with a direct link from the ‘f’ to the

63
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:04,360
‘t’, or you might hear some people pronounce
a short schwa sound in between: comf-/ə/-table.

64
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:12,050
However, if you pronounce a long vowel sound
here, it will sound strange: com-/fɔː/-table.

65
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,550
That doesn’t sound right.

66
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,140
In summary, there’s a range of possible
pronunciations.

67
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:23,690
You don’t have to pronounce things in one
specific way, but you should try to get your

68
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,100
pronunciation inside that range.

69
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:34,560
Next, let’s look at another useful form
of elision.

70
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,960
In some cases, consonant sounds are changed
or not pronounced.

71
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:49,080
This is especially true for /t/ and /d/ sounds
at the end of a word.

72
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,460
For example, look at this phrase:

73
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,440
last summer.

74
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,120
Can you hear what happens to the ‘t’ at
the end of ‘last?’

75
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,650
Listen once more: last summer.

76
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,680
There are two possibilities here.

77
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,940
The ‘t’ can disappear completely, so that
you link the ‘s’ in ‘last’ and the

78
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,120
first ‘s’ of ‘summer’ together: ‘las_summer’.

79
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,200
Or, the ‘t’ can become glottal.

80
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,360
This means the ‘t’ is half pronounced.

81
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,180
Think about it like this: when you say /t/,
you do two things.

82
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:34,190
First, you put your tongue behind your top
teeth, and build up pressure in your throat.

83
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:41,720
Then, you move your tongue down and back,
and release the air pressure to make the sound:

84
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,680
/t/.

85
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,330
When you pronounce a glottal ‘t’, you
just do the first part.

86
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:58,819
You put your tongue in position and build
up pressure as if you’re going to say /t/,

87
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:03,139
but then you never release the sound.

88
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:08,360
See if you can hear it: ‘last summer’.

89
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,360
‘Last summer’.

90
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,350
This is common with ‘t’ sounds at the
end of words.

91
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:24,940
Also, there’s a rule: if one word ends in
a consonant plus ‘t’, and the next word

92
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:34,259
starts with a consonant, then the ‘t’
either disappears or becomes glottal.

93
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,800
The same is true for /d/ sounds.

94
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,669
For example: ‘red banana’.

95
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:45,660
/d/ and /t/ are similar sounds; you make the
same movement with your tongue for both.

96
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,130
So, they behave in a similar way.

97
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:56,069
Here, in the phrase ‘red banana’, you
might drop the ‘d’ completely: ‘reb_banana’.

98
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:02,930
Or, you might pronounce a glottal consonant,
where you put your tongue into position to

99
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:09,540
make a /d/ sound, but you never release it:
‘red banana’.

100
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,580
Let’s practise with some phrases.

101
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:21,260
First question: which final ‘t’ and ‘d’
sounds can disappear?

102
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:30,099
Remember that this rule applies only if a
word ends in a consonant plus ‘t’ or ‘d’,

103
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:34,219
*and* the next word starts with a consonant.

104
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:41,229
And when we say ‘disappear’, we don’t
necessarily mean that the sound is not pronounced

105
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,120
at all.

106
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:52,700
It might disappear completely, or it might
be pronounced with a glottal consonant.

107
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,770
What about ‘I didn’t look at it?’

108
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,210
There are three words ending in ‘t’ here.

109
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:05,100
The ‘t’ in ‘didn’t’ can disappear,
but the other two need to be pronounced: ‘I

110
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,580
didn_look at it.’

111
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:16,560
In, ‘Just say what you think’, the ‘t’
in ‘just’ can disappear.

112
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,240
The ‘t’ in ‘what’ might disappear
in fast or informal speech: ‘Jus_say what

113
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,029
you think.’

114
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:30,820
In ‘stand next to the window’, the ‘d’
in ‘stand’ can disappear.

115
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,839
The ‘t’ in ‘next’ is linked to the
‘t’ in ‘to’: ‘Stand next_to the

116
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,220
window.’

117
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:46,120
In the last phrase, the ‘d’ on ‘hold’
will disappear: ‘Can you hold my bag for

118
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,140
a second?’

119
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,680
Let’s read the phrases together one more
time.

120
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,120
Try to repeat them:

121
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,840
I didn’t look at it.

122
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,690
Just say what you think.

123
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,020
Stand next to the window.

124
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,740
Can you hold my bag for a second?

125
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,370
Like we mentioned before, there’s a range
of possible pronunciations here.

126
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,660
There isn’t just one correct way to say
these.

127
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:28,750
However, it does sound strange to pronounce
a full consonant sound.

128
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:33,420
This can add a vowel sound, which sounds unnatural.

129
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:40,029
For example, if you say ‘last-/ə/-summer’,
this doesn’t sound so good.

130
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:48,580
You’ve seen how elision works with syllables
and sounds, but elision can also apply to

131
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,680
whole words.

132
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,620
Let’s see how!

133
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:58,980
Look at a short sentence: I’m not ready.

134
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:05,000
Now, listen again: ‘m’not ready’
What happened?

135
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,420
Can you hear?

136
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,800
Listen one more time: ‘m’not ready’.

137
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,420
When speaking fast, you can often shorten
or remove pronouns like ‘I’, ‘you’,

138
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,230
or ‘he’ from the start of a sentence or
question.

139
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:30,660
You can do the same with auxiliary verbs like
‘am’, ‘has’, ‘is’ and so on.

140
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:37,440
Let’s look at one more example: ‘He’s
left already.’

141
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,450
Can you hear what I said?

142
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,180
Listen again: ‘He’s left already.’

143
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:50,870
Here, the word ‘he’ is shortened or removed,
so the sentence starts with a *very* short

144
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:57,000
‘i’ vowel linking to a /z/ sound: ‘iz’left
already’.

145
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,990
Let’s do some more practice!

146
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,440
We’ll read five sentences.

147
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,300
You’ll hear each sentence twice.

148
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,930
Try to write them down.

149
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:11,760
Pause the video between sentences if you need
time to write.

150
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,960
Ready?

151
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,630
Let’s start!

152
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,230
You did it!

153
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,580
It’s upstairs.

154
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,240
Do you live near near?

155
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,260
Has he paid you back yet?

156
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,340
Have you tried it?

157
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,900
Listen once more:
You did it!

158
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,260
It’s upstairs.

159
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,350
Do you live near here?

160
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,740
Has he paid you back yet?

161
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,230
Have you tried it?

162
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,980
Do you have five sentences written down?

163
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,360
Let’s check!

164
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,040
Did you get them right?

165
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,180
Let’s see what’s happening here.

166
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,580
‘You’ can be shortened to /jə/, with
a schwa sound.

167
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:13,860
This schwa can be so short that it’s difficult
to hear: y’did it!

168
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:24,280
In ‘it’s upstairs’, ‘it’s’ can
be shortened to a /ts/ sound: ts’upstairs.

169
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,450
‘Do you’ can be shortened to /djə/.

170
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:35,560
Again, the vowel sound can become *very* short:
dya live near here?

171
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,590
‘H’ sounds at the start of a word often
disappear.

172
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:49,350
So, ‘has he’ can become /əzi/, again
with a very short schwa in many cases: /əzi/

173
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,400
paid you back yet?

174
00:13:52,400 --> 00:14:00,170
Similarly, ‘have you’ can be shortened
to /vjə/, as in /vjə/ tried it?

175
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:05,300
Like with everything in this lesson, you don’t
need to pronounce everything exactly in this

176
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,560
way.

177
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:16,560
But, it is useful to understand how sounds,
syllables and words can be shortened or removed.

178
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,160
Understanding these ideas will help you to
understand natural speech in English.

179
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,269
There’s a lot of information in this topic,
and we could have given many more examples,

180
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:32,540
but this lesson’s long enough already.

181
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:39,640
What about you—can you think of any other
examples where sounds, syllables or words

182
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:42,240
disappear?

183
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,040
Share your examples in the comments!

184
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,269
Thanks for watching!

185
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:48,850
See you next time!
