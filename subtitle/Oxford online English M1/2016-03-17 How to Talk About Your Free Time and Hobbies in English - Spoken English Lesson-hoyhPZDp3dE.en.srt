00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:03,060
Hello, I'm Oli.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,480
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:12,769
In this lesson, you can learn about how to
talk about your free time and hobbies in English.

4
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:14,860
What do you like doing in your free time?

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,120
Do you have any interesting hobbies?

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,410
Talking about your free time is a great way
to start a conversation in English, or to

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,170
find things in common when you're speaking
to somebody.

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,480
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able
to speak clearly and naturally about your

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,050
free time and your hobbies in English.

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,890
Part one: free time and hobbies vocabulary.

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,789
What words do you know for free time activities
in English?

12
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:50,089
Some people prefer things you can do at home,
like watching TV, reading, or cooking.

13
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:56,979
Other people like sports, like playing football,
playing basketball, playing tennis, going

14
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:03,629
swimming, going jogging, or going climbing,
or maybe doing boxing, doing judo, or doing

15
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:04,629
yoga.

16
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:11,350
Of course, many people prefer more social
activities, for example, hanging out with

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,500
your friends, relaxing with your family, or
going shopping.

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,160
Or maybe you like to do something more creative,
like taking photos, painting, or writing stories

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,570
or writing a blog.

20
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,730
What about you?

21
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,310
What kind of free time activities do you prefer?

22
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,550
Let's look at how you can talk about free
time activities and hobbies which you like.

23
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,940
Part two: what do you like doing?

24
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:46,300
In my free time, I like . . . What could you
say here?

25
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,640
"In my free time, I like playing basketball."

26
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,030
"In my free time, I like relaxing with my
family."

27
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,820
"In my free time, I like reading books."

28
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,000
Can you see a pattern here?

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,250
In every sentence, after 'like,' we use a
verb plus -ing.

30
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,869
Can you make a sentence?

31
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,840
What do you like doing in your free time?

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,850
But just using 'like' can be repetitive and
boring.

33
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,650
So what other verbs can you use?

34
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:26,140
Well, you could use verbs like 'love', 'enjoy',
or 'hate'.

35
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,170
For example: "I love going swimming."

36
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,320
"I enjoy watching TV."

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,030
"I hate going shopping."

38
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,270
Can you see the same pattern?

39
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:44,670
After all of these verbs, you need to use
a verb with -ing.

40
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:51,680
You can also add words like 'really', 'sometimes',
or 'absolutely', to make your meaning stronger

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,960
or weaker.

42
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,750
For example: "I really like taking photos."

43
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,530
"Sometimes I enjoy going jogging."

44
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,960
"I absolutely hate playing football."

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,420
Now it's your turn.

46
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,740
What can you say?

47
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,270
Can you make your own sentences?

48
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,990
OK, so now you can say something about what
you like or don't like doing.

49
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,540
Let's look at how you can add more details
to your ideas.

50
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,020
First, let's say how often you do your free
time activity.

51
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,569
For example: "I like playing sport.

52
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:31,630
I play football every Tuesday evening."

53
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,580
"I absolutely hate going shopping.

54
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,540
I only go shopping once or twice a year."

55
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:44,680
"I really like taking photos, but I don't
get the chance to do it often."

56
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,810
What about you?

57
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,320
How often do you do your hobbies?

58
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,410
You can use these phrases to help you talk.

59
00:03:51,410 --> 00:04:00,980
'Every . . .' For example: 'every weekend',
'every Saturday afternoon', 'every day'.

60
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:10,850
'Once or twice a . . .', for example: 'once
a week', 'twice a month', 'three times a year',

61
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,989
and so on.

62
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,780
Can you make some sentences like this about
your free time and hobbies?

63
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,930
How often do you do your hobbies?

64
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:27,270
Next, let's add some details about where you
do your hobby or free time activity.

65
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,560
For example: "I like playing sport.

66
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,970
I play football every Tuesday evening at the
park near my house."

67
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,720
"I enjoy having coffee with my friends.

68
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,930
We go to a cafe in the city center once or
twice a week."

69
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:49,169
"I really like taking wildlife photos in the
forest, but I don't get the chance to do it

70
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,180
often."

71
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,810
You can see that our answers are getting more
detailed.

72
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,790
When you speak, you should always try to add
some details to your ideas, like this.

73
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,830
It will make your English sound more interesting
and more natural.

74
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,990
What about you?

75
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,310
Can you add some details like these to your
sentences?

76
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,070
Pause the video.

77
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,070
Practice.

78
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,150
Try to make some sentences.

79
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,150
Say them out loud.

80
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,600
Practice a little bit.

81
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
OK.

82
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,470
next, let's look at giving background information,
especially if you have an interesting or an

83
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,180
unusual hobby.

84
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,270
You can talk about when and why you started
doing it.

85
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:33,800
For example, "I started playing tennis when
I was 10."

86
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,000
"I've been learning to paint for six months
now."

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,139
"I decided to do yoga because I wanted to
be healthy."

88
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:47,699
"My French friend got me into climbing."

89
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:53,520
In the last sentence, the phrase, "My friend
got me into something," means that your friend

90
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,450
introduced this activity to you, and now you
like it.

91
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,270
What can you say about your hobby?

92
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,330
Can you use some of these phrases to talk
about yourself?

93
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,850
For example, I started climbing when I was
living in Russia.

94
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,210
I've been climbing for about eight years.

95
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:18,220
I also recently decided to do yoga because
I wanted to be more flexible.

96
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,350
When I was younger, my dad got me into photography.

97
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,360
What about you?

98
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,199
What are your examples?

99
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:32,199
Finally, let's look at how you can add some
descriptive words to say why you do or don't

100
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,449
enjoy something.

101
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:37,650
For example, "I like climbing because it's
really exciting."

102
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,790
"I love doing yoga because it's so relaxing."

103
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:48,160
"I really like writing stories because it's
creative, and I like using my imagination."

104
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,580
You can also use negative adjectives to talk
about things you don't like.

105
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,400
For example, "I don't like going jogging because
it's tiring."

106
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,449
"I hate watching TV because I find it boring."

107
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:06,979
"I've been trying to learn to paint, but it's
too hard."

108
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:10,750
Why do you like your hobbies?

109
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,520
What are some activities you don't like doing?

110
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,190
Can you say why you don't like them?

111
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,039
Try to make some sentences and practice using
this language.

112
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,050
OK, now it's your turn to speak.

113
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,440
Let's try using everything we've looked at
to make a longer answer.

114
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,130
For example, "I really like playing tennis.

115
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,960
I play every weekend at the park near my house.

116
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,080
Sometimes I play with my brother, or sometimes
with a friend.

117
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,710
My brother got me into it because he loves
sports, and he needed someone to play with.

118
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,740
I didn't like it at first because it was hard,
and I lost all the time.

119
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,669
But now, I enjoy it, especially when I beat
my brother."

120
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:56,759
OK, let's do one more sample answer.

121
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,710
"I love taking photos.

122
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,259
Once or twice a month, I go to different areas
of the city and look for interesting pictures

123
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:05,550
to take.

124
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,009
I've been interested in photography since
I was young, when my dad got me a camera for

125
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:11,430
my birthday.

126
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,830
I like it because it's creative, and I can
express myself through my pictures.

127
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:22,199
Anyone can use a camera, but you need to use
your imagination to find good pictures."

128
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,240
Now, can you talk about your free time?

129
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,460
What do you like doing?

130
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,620
Where do you go, and how often?

131
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,390
When did you start doing this hobby, and why?

132
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:41,070
And, why do you like or, perhaps, dislike
this activity?

133
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,930
Try to talk for at least 30 seconds.

134
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,310
Give lots of details.

135
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,450
Add details to make your answer more interesting.

136
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,290
OK, that's the end of the lesson.

137
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,500
Thanks very much for watching.

138
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,210
I hope you learned something about how to
talk about your free time in English.

139
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,500
You can see more free lessons on our website,

140
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,570
But that's all, thanks again.

141
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,690
See you next time!

142
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,200
Bye bye.
