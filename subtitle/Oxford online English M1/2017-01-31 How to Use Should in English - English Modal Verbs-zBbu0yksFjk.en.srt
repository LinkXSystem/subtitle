00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,620
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,290
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,810
In this lesson, you can learn about using
the modal verb 'should' in English.

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,150
Do you know how to use 'should' in English?

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:21,560
Like most modal verbs, 'should' has many different
meanings and can be used in many different

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,020
ways.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:29,880
In this lesson, you can learn how to use 'should'
correctly and naturally in different situations.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,090
Let’s start with a simple question:

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,180
What does 'should' mean?

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:43,620
This question sounds simple, but when you
think about it, it’s not so easy to answer.

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,660
Look at a sentence:

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,710
"You shouldn’t work so hard."

13
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:55,650
Could you change this sentence, so that you
keep the same meaning, but without using 'should'?

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,070
Think about it.

15
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,020
There’s more than one possible answer; here’s
one:

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,350
"I think it would be better for you not to
work so hard."

17
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,130
Here’s another:

18
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,940
"I don’t think it’s a good idea for you
to work so hard."

19
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,370
These are not the only two; there are more
possibilities.

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:24,310
From these examples, you can see that when
you use 'should', you’re talking about what

21
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,750
you think is right, or what you think the
best idea for someone.

22
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,890
For example, if I say:

23
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:38,170
"You shouldn’t eat mushrooms if you don’t
know what kind they are."

24
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:44,130
I mean that it’s best for you not to eat
mushrooms if you aren’t sure what they are.

25
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,340
After all, they might be poisonous.

26
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,130
Now, we’re going to look at different meanings
of should in more detail.

27
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,680
Keep the ideas from this section in mind through
this lesson.

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:03,400
Hopefully they’ll make it easier to connect
the different ideas you’re about to see!

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,090
Part two: using 'should' to give advice.

30
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:12,769
This is one of the most common ways to use
'should': giving advice to other people.

31
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:14,450
For example:

32
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,159
"You shouldn’t eat pizza for dinner every
night."

33
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,620
"You should watch “Mad Men”; it’s an
interesting show."

34
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:29,299
In these cases, I’m giving you advice—telling
you what I think is a good idea for you to

35
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:30,299
do.

36
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:33,290
Easy enough, right?

37
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,459
Try to think of your own examples.

38
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:39,730
What kind of things do we give advice about?

39
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,590
Many things: work, study, hobbies, dating,
lifestyle…

40
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,780
Pause the video and practise: give yourself
one piece of advice!

41
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,829
Ok?

42
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:53,989
Let’s move on.

43
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:58,939
Part three: using 'should' to express your
opinion.

44
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:03,890
You can use 'should' to say what you think
is the right thing for someone else to do.

45
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,090
For example:

46
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,819
"He should tell her how he feels."

47
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:14,400
"I think she should apply for that job."

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,310
This is quite similar to giving advice, except
that you’re talking about a third person.

49
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,159
You can also use 'should' in this way to talk
about more general subjects.

50
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,680
For example:

51
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,930
"The government should raise taxes on the
rich."

52
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,809
"Everybody who works should get four weeks’
paid holiday a year."

53
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:37,730
Do you agree with these ideas?

54
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,019
Try to think of one more example on a different
topic.

55
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:45,739
What subjects do you have strong opinions
on?

56
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:49,669
Pause the video and make a sentence with 'should'.

57
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:52,680
Say it out loud!

58
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,419
Up to here, we’ve seen how to use 'should'
to talk about the present or the future.

59
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,889
However, you can also use 'should' to talk
about the past.

60
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:05,129
Let’s see how:

61
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:10,370
Part four: using 'should' to criticise past
mistakes.

62
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,090
Do you know how to use 'should' in the past?

63
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,609
What do you have to add after the verb?

64
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:19,019
Let’s see an example:

65
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,440
"You should have asked me for help."

66
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,920
You can see that to use 'should' in the past,
you need to add 'have' plus a past participle

67
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,770
after the verb 'should'.

68
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,530
Let’s practise this quickly.

69
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,340
Can you complete these two sentences to make
them past?

70
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,040
"He should (book) the tickets earlier."

71
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,570
"They shouldn’t (spend) so much money on
a car."

72
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,410
Think about your answers.

73
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,270
Pause the video if you need time.

74
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,890
Let’s check:

75
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,650
"He should have booked the tickets earlier."

76
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,750
"They shouldn’t have spent so much money
on a car."

77
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:11,080
Next, let’s think about what 'should' means
in these sentences.

78
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,380
We use 'should' in this way to talk about
mistakes in the past; often, we use 'should'

79
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,650
in this way to criticise ourselves or other
people.

80
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,260
For example:

81
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,420
"You should have studied harder for your exam!"

82
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,860
Meaning: you didn’t study hard for your
exam, and I think this was a mistake.

83
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,300
"I shouldn’t have told her."

84
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:42,830
Meaning: I told her, but I wish I hadn’t;
it was a mistake to tell her.

85
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,310
What about you?

86
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,970
Can you think of something you should have
done differently in the past?

87
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,720
Try to make your own example sentences!

88
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,220
For extra practice, you could even write your
sentences down.

89
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,320
Now, we have one more meaning of 'should'
to look at:

90
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,630
Part five: using 'should' to talk about probability.

91
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,750
We said at the beginning that you use 'should'
to talk about the right thing to do.

92
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,650
That’s true for all the meanings of 'should'
we’ve seen until now.

93
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:22,510
However, there’s one exception, one meaning
of 'should' which doesn’t fit this pattern.

94
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,460
Look at two sentences.

95
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,650
Can you see what 'should' means?

96
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,900
"There should be some milk left."

97
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,550
"He should be here soon."

98
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:40,780
Remember: 'should' here has a completely different
meaning to everything we’ve seen so far.

99
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,140
Can you work it out?

100
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,280
In these sentences, 'should' expresses probability.

101
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
If I say:

102
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,930
"There should be some milk left."

103
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,020
I mean that I think there’s probably some
milk left.

104
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,240
By probably I mean ‘more than 50% chance.’

105
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,210
So I might say this if I remember buying milk
a few days ago, and I think there’s some

106
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:13,270
left, but I’m not 100% certain; I think
there’s probably still some milk in the

107
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,330
fridge.

108
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,970
In our other example, if I say:

109
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,060
"He should be here soon."

110
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,800
I mean that he’ll probably get here soon.

111
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,770
For example, imagine your friend is coming
to visit you.

112
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,590
You know that his train arrives at 12.00 and
it takes twenty minutes to get to your house

113
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,020
from the station.

114
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,640
The time now is 12.20.

115
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,850
You could say, "he should be here soon."

116
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:48,120
How do you know if 'should' means “I think
this is the right thing” or “I think this

117
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,450
is probable?”

118
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,500
It depends on the context.

119
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,880
Usually, it’ll be obvious.

120
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,669
For example, if I say:

121
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:01,800
"You should definitely go to the British Museum
if you’re in London.

122
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,169
It’s really worth a visit."

123
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:09,169
It’s clear here that 'should' means “I
think it’s a good idea for you to go to

124
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:14,830
the British Museum” and not, “I think
you’ll probably go to the British Museum.”

125
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,360
That just doesn't make sense.

126
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,560
Similarly, if I say:

127
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,860
"It should take about 30 minutes to get there
by car."

128
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,700
…then 'should' clearly expresses probability.

129
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:32,680
There’s no way for this sentence to be advice
or criticism, or anything like that.

130
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,779
Now, you’ve seen all the possible meanings
of 'should'.

131
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:42,269
Finally, let’s review what you’ve learned
in this class.

132
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:47,360
'Should' is mostly used to express what you
think is right or what you think is the best

133
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
thing.

134
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:56,050
So, you can use 'should' to give advice or
to express your opinion about different topics.

135
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,889
Remember that 'should' is not the same as
'must' or 'have to'.

136
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:05,899
When you use 'should', you aren’t talking
about obligations or things which are necessary,

137
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,939
you’re talking about what you think is best.

138
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:16,050
You can also use 'should' + 'have' + past
participle to talk about the past.

139
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,040
We use 'should' in this way to criticise past
mistakes.

140
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,800
There’s one way to use 'should' which doesn’t
fit this pattern: 'should' can mean that something

141
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,269
is probable.

142
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:35,589
You need to use the context to work out what
'should' means, although it’s quite obvious

143
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:38,410
in most cases.

144
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,639
Remember that probable here has a specific
meaning: it means the chance of something

145
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:46,759
happening is higher than 50%.

146
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:49,399
That’s the end of the lesson.

147
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:54,209
I hope you learned something new about what
'should' means and how to use it.
