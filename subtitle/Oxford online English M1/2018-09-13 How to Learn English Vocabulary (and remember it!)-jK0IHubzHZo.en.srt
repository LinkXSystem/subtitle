00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,400
Hi, I’m Kasia.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,330
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,440
I can’t remember English vocabulary!

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,080
How do I learn new words?

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,120
I learn lots of new words in English, but
I can’t use them!

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,440
I want to have a bigger vocabulary in English.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,710
In this lesson, you can learn how to learn,
remember and use new vocabulary in English.

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:33,780
You can see the common mistakes which many
English learners make when learning vocabulary,

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,940
and you’ll see several simple, practical
ideas that you can use to build your English

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,149
vocabulary and remember what you learn.

11
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:51,000
Let’s start with a general point that’s
very important.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,690
Here are some things we often hear from English
learners:

13
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,210
“I couldn’t read it.

14
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,359
There were too many new words and I didn’t
have time to look them all up in the dictionary.”

15
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:09,660
“I wrote down all of these new words and
I tried to learn them, but I can’t remember

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,960
any of them now!”

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,000
Sound familiar?

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,160
Here’s a fact about your brain: your brain
is very good at throwing away things it doesn’t

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,140
need.

20
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:28,000
Vocabulary learning starts when you choose
which words and phrases to learn or not learn.

21
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:33,670
This is where many English learners go wrong,
by making one of these mistakes:

22
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,130
Trying to learn too many words.

23
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,380
Trying to learn words you don’t need.

24
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,520
Trying to learn big lists of words.

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,719
Trying to learn words you don’t know how
to use.

26
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:55,860
To avoid these mistakes, you need to choose
the vocabulary you study carefully.

27
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,990
Most importantly, if you want to remember
new words and new English vocabulary, you

28
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,159
need to learn things which are useful or meaningful
to you.

29
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,450
If you read a text, and you try to look up
every word you don’t know, of course you’ll

30
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,420
forget most of them.

31
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,930
Most of the words you look up probably won’t
be useful to you, and so your brain won’t

32
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,590
hold onto them.

33
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:25,651
If you write down a list of 100 new words
and try to learn them, the words won’t mean

34
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:26,730
much to you.

35
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:34,470
They’re just a list on a piece of paper—totally
abstract, and also boring!

36
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,340
Our brains don’t like boring.

37
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,600
Boring gets forgotten, fast.

38
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,960
So, what’s the solution?

39
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,520
Only learn a word or phrase if it’s really
useful or meaningful to you in some way.

40
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,819
For example:

41
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:55,050
Your teacher keeps using a word that you don’t
know.

42
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,799
You hear it several times, but you can’t
work out what it means.

43
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:02,299
Then, you hear other people use the same word.

44
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:05,709
You’re curious: what is this word you keep
hearing?

45
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:09,540
You’re reading a really interesting article.

46
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,060
You don’t know every word, but you can understand
the general ideas.

47
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,220
In one paragraph, there’s a word which you
don’t know, and which makes it difficult

48
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,440
for you to understand the idea of the paragraph.

49
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,620
You think the paragraph is important to the
article, and you’re interested to know what

50
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,830
it means.

51
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,220
You’re on holiday in a country where English
is widely spoken.

52
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,900
There’s one kind of food you really want
to order, but you don’t know the word in

53
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,900
English.

54
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,760
These are situations where a new word will
have meaning to you.

55
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,980
If you look up words in situations like these,
you’re more likely to remember them.

56
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:59,090
Firstly, you’ll remember them because these
are words you need to use.

57
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:06,599
Secondly, you’ll remember them because these
are all situations which involve your feelings

58
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,670
in some way.

59
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,920
In the first example, you’re curious about
something.

60
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,849
In the second, you’re interested in the
article you’re reading.

61
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:20,980
In the third situation, you’re (hopefully)
having fun on holiday.

62
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,890
So, this is the first and most important point.

63
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,440
Learn words and phrases which are useful and
meaningful for you.

64
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,070
This gives you the best chance to remember
and use what you learn.

65
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:37,910
Now, another important point: when you say,
“I learned a new word,” you could mean

66
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,780
one of two things.

67
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,940
You could mean that you learned to understand
a new word, or you could mean that you learned

68
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,130
to use a new word.

69
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,490
Those two things are different.

70
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,290
Let’s talk about that!

71
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:58,760
You might have heard the terms ‘passive
vocabulary’ and ‘active vocabulary’.

72
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,480
Your passive vocabulary means words you can
understand, but you don’t use.

73
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,580
Your active vocabulary means words you can
use in your speech or writing.

74
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:15,470
It’s normal that your passive vocabulary
is larger than your active vocabulary in any

75
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,380
language, including your native language.

76
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,160
Many English learners say, “I can understand
words but I can’t use them.”

77
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,460
To some extent, this is normal.

78
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,600
However, what can you do if you want to develop
your active vocabulary in English?

79
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,300
There are two important points here.

80
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,620
First, you need to use different techniques
to build passive or active vocabulary.

81
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,850
Many English learners have problems building
their active vocabulary because the techniques

82
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:51,900
they use to learn vocabulary only increase
their passive vocabulary.

83
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:58,500
Secondly, building active vocabulary takes
a lot more time and work.

84
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,280
If you want to build your active vocabulary,
you need to spend a lot more time studying

85
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,270
and practising each word or phrase you want
to learn.

86
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,060
Let’s look at the first point.

87
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,160
Here are some good techniques for building
passive vocabulary:

88
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,020
Looking up a translation of a word in your
language.

89
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,820
Guessing the meaning of a word from the context.

90
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,490
Looking up a definition of a word in a monolingual
dictionary.

91
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,190
Finding example sentences.

92
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,450
Reading and listening.

93
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:41,580
So, if your vocabulary learning consists of
translating everything into your language,

94
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,210
don’t be surprised if you can’t use what
you learn.

95
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:51,900
This is an okay technique for building your
passive vocabulary, but it won’t help you

96
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,050
to use the words and phrases you study.

97
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,990
What about building active vocabulary?

98
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,250
Here are some good techniques for building
your active vocabulary:

99
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,470
Writing stories or other things that are
personal to you.

100
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,190
Using a new word several times in several
different conversations.

101
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,300
Making example sentences which are personal
to you.

102
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,940
You can see that these things are not necessarily
complicated, but they do require more effort.

103
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,650
It’s much harder to write an example sentence
which is personal to you than it is to read

104
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,670
someone else’s example sentence.

105
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:33,680
It’s much harder to write a story which
means something to you than it is to read

106
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,010
something which someone else wrote.

107
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:41,800
But, if you want to build your active vocabulary,
this is how!

108
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,190
Most English learners are more interested
in developing their active vocabulary, so

109
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,940
in the rest of this lesson, we’ll focus
on specific techniques you can use to build

110
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,400
your active vocabulary in English.

111
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,000
Let’s start with a very important and powerful
idea.

112
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,460
Here’s a question: what is vocabulary?

113
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,780
Did you say ‘words’?

114
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:12,320
Many people think that ‘vocabulary equals
words’.

115
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,260
Of course, words are part of vocabulary, but
they’re only a part.

116
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:25,360
Vocabulary also includes collocations, phrases,
and even full sentences.

117
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:30,340
Even when you’re learning words, you rarely
need single words when you’re speaking.

118
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,760
You need to combine the words into phrases
and sentences if you want to use them.

119
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:43,050
So, it makes sense to learn vocabulary in
the same way: learn phrases, combinations

120
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:47,950
and sentences, because this is what you need
when you’re speaking and writing.

121
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,760
Let’s do an example.

122
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,430
Imagine that you see the word challenge and
you want to know what it means.

123
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,400
So, you look it up and find the meaning.

124
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,340
Next, your goal is to write five sentences
using the word challenge.

125
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,960
Each sentence should be different, and each
sentence should mean something to you.

126
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,820
Try to write things which relate to your life,
your feelings and your thoughts.

127
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:19,650
You can (and should) also try to use different
forms of the word, like the adjective challenging.

128
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,370
You should also research other examples before
you write yours.

129
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:29,500
Look for common collocations—word combinations—with
the word you want to learn.

130
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:36,670
For example, what adjectives are commonly
used with the word challenge?

131
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,820
Think about it.

132
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,500
What phrases or sentences could you write
with this word?

133
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,120
We’ll give you an example, but remember
that you should make your own examples, because

134
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,470
they should be personal to you.

135
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,100
Here are five possible sentences:

136
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,190
I’m bored at work.

137
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,550
I need a new challenge.

138
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,830
Teaching teenagers is fun, but it can be very
challenging.

139
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,240
Running a full marathon was one of the biggest
challenges I’ve ever faced.

140
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:13,920
I set myself a challenge last year: to learn
German to a native-equivalent level.

141
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,780
My sister is a really determined person; she’s
not someone who’ll run away from a challenge.

142
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:25,960
We’ll say it again, because it’s the most
important point here: whatever you write should

143
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,850
be personal to you.

144
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:33,250
Don’t write a sentence about your sister
if you don’t have a sister.

145
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,720
Don’t say something about your sister which
isn’t true.

146
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,090
Make it true, and make it personal.

147
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,890
If it’s personal to you, you’ll remember
it.

148
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,970
If it isn’t, you’ll forget it.

149
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,970
Simple, right?

150
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,700
At this point, there’s one more important
thing you should do.

151
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,450
Ask a teacher, a native speaker or a friend
who’s very good at English to check your

152
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,670
sentences.

153
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,580
You want to make sure you’re learning your
new vocabulary correctly, and you need feedback

154
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,260
to do that.

155
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,810
You can also see that writing sentences like
this lets you learn several useful phrases

156
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,550
at one time.

157
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:16,740
For example, here you have the collocations
a new challenge, to face a challenge, a big

158
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,170
challenge, to set (yourself) a challenge,
and run away from a challenge.

159
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,300
So, if you follow this strategy, you won’t
just learn one word, like challenge.

160
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,420
You’ll learn several words and phrases together,
in a natural way.

161
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:37,090
Remember that this strategy is personal on
both sides: you’re starting with words that

162
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:43,440
are meaningful to you personally, and then
you’re learning those words by writing examples

163
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,390
which are also meaningful to you personally.

164
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:52,920
Yes, this needs work, and it might be very
different from what you do now.

165
00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:00,180
However, if you want an effective way to learn
and remember vocabulary, this is it.

166
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,930
If you do things this way, nothing is abstract
and nothing is boring.

167
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:11,670
Your brain will remember what you learn because
it’s relevant to you, your life and your

168
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,010
feelings.

169
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:18,070
However, if you’re trying to learn a lot
of vocabulary, it’s also important to review

170
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,590
what you’ve learned regularly.

171
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:25,860
Regular review helps to keep vocabulary fresh
in your mind, which will help you to remember

172
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,750
the words and phrases you need when you’re
speaking or writing in English.

173
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:36,070
Let’s look at the most effective ways to
review your vocabulary.

174
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,840
If you have a lot of English vocabulary to
review and remember, it’s a big, complex

175
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,060
job.

176
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,270
But, we have good news!

177
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,180
There are several free tools and apps which
can make this easy.

178
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,650
You need a digital flashcard app.

179
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,960
These apps are designed to help you memorise
and review large amounts of information.

180
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,210
Two of the most popular are Anki and Quizlet.

181
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,700
You can find links below the video.

182
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,960
We aren’t recommending any particular product
or company, but many students have used both

183
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,340
of these with good results.

184
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:17,470
We hear that Quizlet is a little easier to
use, while Anki is more powerful and has more

185
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,090
options, but is also more complex.

186
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:26,370
Try both, or find another program, and see
what works for you.

187
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:32,320
All of these programs work in the same way:
they allow you to set questions for yourself.

188
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,070
You create a card with a question and an answer.

189
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,050
You can write whatever you want for the question
and the answer.

190
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:44,150
After you see a question and the answer, you
decide if the question was easy or difficult

191
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,590
for you.

192
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:51,570
If the question is easy, the app will ask
you again after a longer period.

193
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:57,510
If the question is difficult, the app will
ask you the same question again after a shorter

194
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,690
period, maybe even the same day.

195
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:06,830
This is very effective, because it allows
you to focus more on the things you don’t

196
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,690
know, and it doesn’t waste your time reviewing
things you already know well.

197
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,360
You can often download packs of questions
that other people have made, but you should

198
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,980
make your own questions, using your own, personalised
example sentences.

199
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,960
Let’s see how.

200
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,220
Look at the five sentences we wrote before
to learn the word challenge:

201
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,540
Let’s make five questions from these five
sentences.

202
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,830
Question: I’m bored at work.

203
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,600
I need ________.

204
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,140
Answer: I’m bored at work.

205
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,950
I need a new challenge.

206
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:53,880
Question: Teaching teenagers is fun, but _________
Answer: Teaching teenagers is fun, but it

207
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,260
can be very challenging.

208
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:03,760
Question: I ________ last year: to learn German
to a native-equivalent level.

209
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:11,960
Answer: I set myself a challenge last year:
to learn German to a native-equivalent level.

210
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:20,850
Question: Running a full marathon was _________
Answer: Running a full marathon was one of

211
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,270
the biggest challenges I’ve ever faced.

212
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:30,190
Question: My sister is a really determined
person; ________.

213
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:36,720
Answer: My sister is a really determined person;
she’s not someone who’ll run away from

214
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,680
a challenge.

215
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,140
Can you see what’s going on here?

216
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:46,020
The questions are getting progressively more
difficult.

217
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:51,440
For the first question, you only have to remember
three words: a new challenge.

218
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,390
For the fifth question, you need to remember
a whole clause.

219
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,290
After you’ve made your questions, what next?

220
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,060
Review your vocabulary cards or questions
every day.

221
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,360
We recommend you install Anki, Quizlet or
whatever you use on your phone.

222
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,270
This way, you can review vocabulary when you
have nothing else to do, for example on the

223
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,640
subway or during your lunch break.

224
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,710
Try to use your app and review vocabulary
every day, but don’t overload yourself.

225
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:27,480
Limit the number of new questions or cards
you see each day.

226
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,380
Five new questions per day is a good target.

227
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,750
Again, this takes quite a lot of work.

228
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:39,510
You might think, “Do I really have to do
all this just to remember one word?”

229
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:45,440
Let me ask you some questions in return: do
you want to really build your English vocabulary?

230
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,790
Do you want to remember new English words
that you study?

231
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,090
Do you want to learn to use new English vocabulary?

232
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:58,529
If you answered ‘yes’, ‘yes’, and
‘yes’, then this is how.

233
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:02,370
It takes time and effort, but it also works.

234
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,370
Let’s review the steps you need to take:

235
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:11,900
One: choose words which are useful and meaningful
to you personally; don’t learn big lists

236
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,829
of words, and don’t learn words which you
won’t use.

237
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:21,839
Two: decide if you want to just understand
a word, or if you want to use it.

238
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,470
Use different vocabulary-learning techniques
depending on what you want.

239
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:32,660
Three: if you want to add words to your active
vocabulary, then write 3-5 example sentences,

240
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,770
using the new word.

241
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:40,830
The sentences should be relevant to you, your
life, your thoughts and your feelings.

242
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:48,040
Four: get feedback on your example sentences,
from a teacher or friend, to make sure you’re

243
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,760
using your new vocabulary correctly.

244
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:57,310
Five: add your example sentences to a digital
flashcard app like Quizlet or Anki.

245
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:02,400
Make questions of different difficulty, so
that some questions are easier and some are

246
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,740
harder.

247
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:11,000
Six: use your digital flashcard app daily,
or as often as you can!

248
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,140
Follow these steps and your English vocabulary
will increase, you’ll remember new words

249
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:21,140
in English, and you’ll be able to use the
new English words you learn.

00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,010
