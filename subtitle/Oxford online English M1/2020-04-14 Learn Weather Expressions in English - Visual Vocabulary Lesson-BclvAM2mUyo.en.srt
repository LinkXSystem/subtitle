8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,980
Let’s go!

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,870
It’s sunny.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,820
The sun is shining.

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,060
It’s bright.

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,000
It’s humid.

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,160
The air feels heavy.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,900
It’s sticky.

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,300
It’s too hot.

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,860
There’s a heatwave.

17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,650
To talk about the weather in English, you
often use ‘it’ plus an adjective.

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:14,750
Before, you heard some examples, including
‘it’s sunny’, ‘it’s humid’ and

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,220
‘it’s too hot.’

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,860
You can use ‘be’ in different forms to
talk about the past or the future.

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,130
For example ‘It was sunny yesterday.’

22
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,480
‘It will be sunny tomorrow.’

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,420
‘It has been sunny recently.’

24
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,670
You also heard ‘There’s a heatwave.’

25
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:46,150
This is another common pattern to talk about
the weather: use ‘there is’ or ‘there

26
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,120
are’, plus a noun.

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,080
There’s a strong wind.

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,760
It’s windy.

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,700
There’s a gentle breeze.

30
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,020
There’s a thunderstorm.

31
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,200
There’s a lot of lightning.

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,560
Sometimes, you use ‘it’ with a continuous
verb to talk about the weather.

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,300
It’s raining hard.

34
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,600
It’s pouring down.

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,520
It’s hailing.

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,220
It’s snowing lightly.

37
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,860
It’s snowing heavily.

38
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,500
It’s raining lightly.

39
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,360
It’s a little wet outside.

40
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,650
If you use a continuous verb, you can also
make it past.

41
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,340
For example ‘It was raining hard all day
yesterday.’

42
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,790
‘It was snowing lightly when we left.’

43
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,920
To talk about the future, you *can* use a
future continuous verb, but it’s more common

44
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,819
to use ‘will’ or ‘going to’ plus an
infinitive.

45
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,200
For example ‘It’s going to pour down soon.’

46
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,120
‘They say it will snow heavily at the weekend.’

47
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,640
It’s overcast.

48
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,640
There’s a lot of cloud.

49
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,340
It’s a grey day.

50
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,180
There’s one more common pattern.

51
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:47,260
You can use ‘it’s a … day’, and add
an adjective before ‘day’.

52
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,470
You heard ‘it’s a grey day’.

53
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:58,960
You could also say ‘It’s a cloudy day’,
or ‘It’s a bright day.’

54
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,860
The forest is misty in the morning.

55
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,440
It’s a foggy day.

56
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,640
There’s some fog, but it’s not too thick.

57
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,320
‘Fog’ and ‘mist’ are similar, but
not the same.

58
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,820
Do you know the difference?

59
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,520
Fog is basically cloud which is at ground
level.

60
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,760
Mist is caused by water droplets in the air.

61
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,520
They’re similar, but fog is generally thicker
and lasts longer.

62
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,400
Mist is thinner and normally disappears fast.

63
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:47,980
Many places are misty in the morning, but
the mist disappears as the sun comes up.

64
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,180
There are some light clouds.

65
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,430
It doesn’t look like rain.

66
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:03,420
If you hear ‘it looks like rain’, what
will the sky look like?

67
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:08,419
‘It looks like rain’ means that it’s
likely to rain very soon.

68
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:17,020
So, the sky is probably overcast, with lots
of heavy, dark clouds.

69
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,560
There isn’t a cloud in the sky.

70
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,580
It’s perfectly clear.

71
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:31,610
If you describe the weather as ‘clear’,
you mean that there are few or no clouds.

72
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:40,000
You *also* mean that the air is clear: there’s
no mist, or fog, or haze, or anything similar.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,160
If it’s clear, you can see a long way.

74
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,419
It’s icy.

75
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,350
The river has frozen over.

76
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:59,370
If you live somewhere cold, rivers, lakes
and other bodies of water might freeze over.

77
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:05,900
‘Freeze over’ means they freeze on top,
but there’s still liquid underneath.

78
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,270
If it’s really cold, the river might freeze
solid.

79
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:19,780
If the river has frozen solid, the whole thing
is ice; there’s no liquid water.

80
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:25,500
There’s a blizzard – you can hardly see
ten metres!

81
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,639
A blizzard is a kind of storm.

82
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:38,220
To count as a blizzard, you need heavy snow
and strong winds at the same time.

83
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,300
The recent rain has caused severe flooding
in some areas.

84
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,720
The floods have caused millions of euros of
damage.

85
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,740
Heavy rain can cause floods – or flooding.

86
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,920
‘Flooding’ is a gerund, but it’s often
used as a plain noun.

87
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,440
In the sentences you saw, you could say ‘floods’
or ‘flooding’.

88
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,040
The hurricane is approaching the coast.

89
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:19,460
It is predicted that the typhoon will make
landfall in the next 24 hours.

90
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:27,920
The storm will bring gale force winds, with
gusts of up to 80 kilometres per hour.

91
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,040
There are different words for strong winds
and storms.

92
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,600
A gale is defined by the wind force on the
Beaufort scale.

93
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,949
There are different definitions, but anything
above a specific strength is a gale.

94
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:46,680
What about hurricanes and typhoons?

95
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,440
Do you know the difference?

96
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,020
Hurricanes and typhoons are both powerful
tropical storms, but they start in different

97
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,340
places.

98
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,980
Hurricanes form in the Atlantic Ocean, while
typhoons form in the Pacific.

99
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,060
That’s all.

100
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,080
Thanks for watching!
