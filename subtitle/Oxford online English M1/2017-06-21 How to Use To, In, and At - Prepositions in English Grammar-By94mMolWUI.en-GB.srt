00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,569
Hi, I’m Niamh and welcome to Oxford Online
English.

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:13,820
In this lesson, we’re going to look at the
prepositions to, in and at.

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:20,660
Have you ever asked yourself why there don’t
seem to be any rules for prepositions in English?

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:27,150
If you have problems with these small words,
don’t worry; you’re not the only one!

5
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,320
A good way to understand and learn the difference
between prepositions is to look at them in

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,190
groups. That way you can compare and contrast
them.

7
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:47,960
We’re going to look at to, in and at together
because they can be used to talk about place.

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:57,219
First, look at a picture:
Listen to three sentences. Which one fits

9
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:58,769
the picture?

10
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:03,519
I’m driving to the airport.
I’m at the airport.

11
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:08,380
I’m in the airport.

12
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:16,840
Which sentence fits?
The first one: I’m driving to the airport.

13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,980
A good way to understand English prepositions
is to look at the words that go before and

14
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,610
after them.

15
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,360
Which words go before and after the preposition
to?

16
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:39,000
For example, which verb comes before to in
our sample sentence?

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,350
The verb drive. Drive is a verb of movement.

18
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:54,250
To expresses movement, so before to, we need
a verb that expresses movement.

19
00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:04,850
So, let’s think: can you think of any other
verbs which express movement?

20
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,310
Go is an obvious example.

21
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:15,620
Maybe you also thought of verbs like run,
walk or come.

22
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,620
For example:

23
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,830
He ran to end of the road,
We walk to school every day.

24
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,209
Do you want to come to my house for dinner?

25
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:33,069
These verbs are all about people and how they
move.

26
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:37,269
You can also move things.

27
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:38,329
For example:

28
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:42,540
He sent a letter to France.

29
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,279
Can you think of any more verbs related to
moving things?

30
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:53,590
Good examples are take or move, but there
are many more.

31
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,849
For example:

32
00:02:55,849 --> 00:03:01,980
I took my bike to the shop to get it repaired.
We moved the sofa to the other side of the

33
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,409
room.

34
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:12,400
I have another tip for you. You can also use
to after nouns that express movement.

35
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,769
What do I mean by that?

36
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:22,090
What’s the missing word in this sentence?

37
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,900
I’m planning a ---- to China this summer.

38
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:35,030
Do you know?
The missing word is trip.

39
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,049
I’m planning a trip to China this summer.

40
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:47,200
Can you think of any other nouns like trip,
where you can use to after the noun?

41
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:55,590
You can also use to after nouns like holiday,
invitation or way.

42
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,349
For example:

43
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:03,739
We went on holiday to Egypt last year.
They sent us an invitation to their housewarming

44
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:08,879
party.
Do you know the way to the botanical gardens?

45
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:17,230
There is an exception to these rules. Do you
know what it is? It’s with a very common

46
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:25,190
word, which I’m sure you all know.
The place home does not use the preposition

47
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,970
to.

48
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,560
You cannot say:

49
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,430
I’m going to home.

50
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,310
The correct sentence is:

51
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,440
I’m going home.

52
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:43,010
Also, don’t use to with the pronouns here
or there.

53
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,310
For example:

54
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,760
Bring it to here.
Let’s go to there and see what we can find.

55
00:04:49,760 --> 00:05:00,970
So, now you know how to use to, use to after
verbs or nouns which express movement.

56
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:07,660
So, what about in?
How would you describe this picture? There’s

57
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:13,040
a woman—where is she?

58
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,060
You can say:

59
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,400
She’s in the library.

60
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,160
Why do you use in?

61
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,750
You use in to describe being surrounded by
walls or other things.

62
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,660
Let’s look at some more examples:

63
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:44,350
The Empire State Building is in New York.
They stayed in a small town in the south of

64
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,470
England.
My cousin lives in China.

65
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:54,110
Remember, to understand prepositions, you
should look at the words before and after

66
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,530
the preposition.

67
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:05,460
Let’s look at the verbs you can use before
in. You can see the verbs be, stay and live.

68
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,950
Do these verbs express movement?

69
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:16,420
No, they describe states, without movement.

70
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:22,400
Can you think of other examples of verbs which
don’t express movement?

71
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,620
There are many. You could use stand, sleep
or study. For example:

72
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:37,520
Why’s he standing in the corner like that?
She was sleeping in the car on the way here.

73
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,670
Do you prefer to study in your room or in
the library?

74
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,620
Now let’s look at the nouns.

75
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:54,050
All of these nouns: New York, China, a small
town, the corner, the car, your room, the

76
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,570
library—what connects them?

77
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:04,020
They’re all places which surround you.

78
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:11,600
You use in for cities, countries and buildings
which you are inside.

79
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:19,780
These are direct, physical ways to use in.
Can you think of other things which you can

80
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,670
use after in?

81
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:28,990
You can also use in in more indirect ways.
For example:

82
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:35,010
Is that you in the picture?
She works in the finance department.

83
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,210
I read about it in the newspaper.

84
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:48,100
So, use in with verbs which don’t express
movement, like be, stay or live.

85
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,840
And, use in with places or things which surround
you.

86
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:01,300
So, what about at?
Look at some examples with at:

87
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,220
She wasn’t at the bus stop when the bus
came.

88
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:12,980
I’m waiting for you at the end of the road.
We’ll meet you at the subway exit.

89
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:21,260
Which verbs can we use with at? We have be,
wait and meet.

90
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,100
These verbs do not express movement.

91
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:32,200
This sounds very similar to in. So, what’s
the difference?

92
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:41,120
Let’s look at the words after the preposition.
You have the bus stop, the end of the road,

93
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,640
and the subway exit.

94
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:51,830
Why at the bus stop? Why not in the bus stop?

95
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:58,090
You use at for bus stop because you’re not
surrounded by it.

96
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:05,530
Think about it: the bus stop could just be
a pole by the road with a sign on it.

97
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:12,150
In this case, you can’t be in the bus stop,
right? There’s nothing to be inside.

98
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:20,800
Similarly, you say at the end of the road
or at the subway exit because it’s a specific

99
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,380
place, but you’re not surrounded by anything.

100
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,130
So, then why do we say things like:

101
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:37,130
She’s studying microbiology at university.
I saw it at the cinema.

102
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,320
We can get something to eat at the supermarket.

103
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,260
Why do we say at the cinema and not in the
cinema? After all, the cinema is a place which

104
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:56,810
surrounds you.
It’s because you use at to talk about why

105
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,490
you go to a particular place.

106
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,490
If you say:

107
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,840
She’s studying microbiology at university.

108
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:12,210
You use at because you talk about what she’s
doing at university, and why she’s there.

109
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,460
She’s there because she’s a student.

110
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,839
Similarly, if you say:

111
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,550
I saw it at the cinema.

112
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:28,990
What are you talking about? What is ‘it’?

113
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:34,540
I hope it’s obvious that ‘it’ is a film!
You say at the cinema because you’re going

114
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,480
to the cinema to watch a film.

115
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:44,890
You’re not focusing on the place as a place;
you’re focusing on why you go there.

116
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,960
Let’s look at another, slightly different
example:

117
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,290
Did you meet Anne at the party?

118
00:10:52,290 --> 00:11:05,360
Okay, what about party? That’s not exactly
a physical location. So, why do you use at?

119
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,580
You can also use at for events.

120
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,490
For example:

121
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:19,810
He met his wife at a speed metal concert.
There were so many people at the wedding.

122
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:26,440
So, like in, you use at to describe where
something is.

123
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:35,850
Unlike in, use at to talk about specific places
where you’re not surrounded by anything.

124
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:43,150
You can also use at when you want to focus
on why you go to a place, rather than focusing

125
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,610
on the place as a place.

126
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,110
Finally, you can use at for events.

127
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:58,190
So now we’ve looked at each preposition
individually, let’s compare, and contrast

128
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:04,620
them.
Okay, so can you remember the difference between

129
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:13,380
to, in and at in English?
To expresses movement. That means you need

130
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:21,560
a verb which expresses movement before to,
and a place after to.

131
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,420
At and in both express where something is.

132
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:33,080
There are some places which can only be used
with one preposition. For example:

133
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:40,170
Are you still in bed?
There’s still some sauce in the fridge.

134
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:50,800
He sat at the end of the table.
What did you do at work today?

135
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,630
In these cases, you can’t choose. There’s
only one possibility.

136
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:04,300
However, sometimes, you can use either at
or in with no difference in meaning:

137
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:14,980
I can’t talk right now. I’m in a meeting.
I can’t talk right now. I’m at a meeting.

138
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:24,930
Then, sometimes at and in are both possible,
but with slightly different meanings.

139
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,120
For example:

140
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:33,240
I’m at the bank.
I’m in the bank.

141
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:41,160
Can you tell the difference?
Now, these two sentences could have the same

142
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,350
meaning. They aren’t necessarily different.

143
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:54,490
However, they could be different. I’m in
the bank focuses on the bank as a physical

144
00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:02,100
place. Maybe it started raining really hard,
and you just ran into the bank so you wouldn’t

145
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,300
get wet.

146
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:11,500
I’m at the bank focuses on the bank as a
bank. If you say, I’m at the bank, you have

147
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,370
some banking to do there.

148
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,830
Let’s see one more example like this:

149
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:27,770
We were at Mike’s apartment last night.
We were in Mike’s apartment last night.

150
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:36,709
Can you tell the difference this time?
This time, the sentences are definitely different,

151
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:41,950
and you probably wouldn’t use one of them!

152
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:50,560
We were at Mike’s apartment last night focuses
on why you were there. Why were you there?

153
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,279
You were visiting Mike, probably. Maybe you
went over to Mike’s for dinner, or something

154
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,950
like that.

155
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:08,550
We were in Mike’s apartment last night focuses
on Mike’s apartment as a place. This suggests

156
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:17,430
that you were in Mike’s apartment, but Mike
wasn’t. So, what were you doing there?

157
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:24,140
This is why you probably wouldn’t say in
Mike’s apartment.

158
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:30,899
I hope some of these rules have helped you
understand the difference between these prepositions.

159
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:38,290
I strongly recommend that when you are learning
vocabulary, don’t just learn one word but

160
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,910
