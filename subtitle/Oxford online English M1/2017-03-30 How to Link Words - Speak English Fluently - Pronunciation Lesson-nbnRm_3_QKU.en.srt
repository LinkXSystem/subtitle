00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:05,279
Hi, I’m Gina.

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,279
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:11,789
Look at a sentence:
Do you remember that time when Anna and Amy

4
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:13,889
fell into the swimming pool?

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,050
Try reading the sentence.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:24,750
Can you pronounce the sentence in one sound,
without any pauses?

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:33,550
Listen to me one more time:
Do you remember that time when Anna and Amy

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,120
fell into the swimming pool?

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,750
When native speakers talk, they don’t pause
between words.

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:48,929
They pronounce whole phrases and even sentences
as one continuous sound.

11
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:55,219
If you want to speak English more fluently
and sound more natural, you should try to

12
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:56,219
do this too.

13
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,219
But how?

14
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:04,690
There are many pronunciation points you need
to study, but today we’re going to look

15
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:09,159
at just one very important point: linking.

16
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:20,259
Linking is how you connect words when you
speak, so that two words are pronounced together.

17
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:27,439
For example: 'that time'; 'when_Anna'.

18
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,530
Here we can see two different types of link.

19
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:39,070
You’ll learn about these ways to link words,
and more, in this lesson.

20
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,920
Before we start, we need to check one thing.

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,659
Do you know the difference between consonants
and vowels?

22
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:56,539
A, E, I, O and U are vowels.

23
00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:00,290
All the other letters are consonants.

24
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,549
Okay?

25
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:06,859
Let’s look at the first way to link words:

26
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:11,870
Part one: linking two consonants.

27
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,409
When you say 'that time', what happens?

28
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,230
How many times do you pronounce /t/?

29
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,720
The answer: just once.

30
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,830
The two words ‘share’ the /t/ sound: 'that
time'.

31
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,940
Try it.

32
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,040
Can you link the words?

33
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,620
When one word ends with a consonant sound,
and the next word starts with the same consonant

34
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,909
sound, we link the sounds.

35
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:47,530
For example:

36
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,159
'Red dress'.

37
00:02:50,159 --> 00:03:00,209
We have two /d/ sounds together, so the two
words share the sound: 'red dress'.

38
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,689
'Cheap places'.

39
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:13,819
We have two /p/ sounds together, so again
the two words share the sound: 'cheap places.'

40
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,520
'Feel lucky'.

41
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,879
The two words share the /l/ sound: 'feel lucky'.

42
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,220
Can you pronounce the links?

43
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,560
Repeat after me:

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:36,330
'Red dress'; 'cheap places'; 'feel lucky'.

45
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,980
Let’s put them in a sentence:

46
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,730
She bought a really nice red dress last week.

47
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,209
Do you know any cheap places to stay in Barcelona?

48
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,270
I feel lucky—let’s play poker!

49
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:58,560
Can you read the sentences?

50
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,550
Focus on pronouncing the links between the
consonants.

51
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:10,010
Next, remember that links depend on the sounds,
not the spelling.

52
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,969
For example: 'look cool'.

53
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:22,229
The letters here are different—‘c’ and
‘k’—but the sounds are the same: /k/.

54
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:30,900
So we link the words, and they share the /k/
sound: 'look cool'.

55
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:38,610
You can see the same thing here: 'quite tall';
'nice sofa'.

56
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:45,600
We link these because the sounds are the same,
even though the spellings are different.

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,310
Let’s try these in some short sentences:

58
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,630
You look cool in those jeans.

59
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,943
He’s quite tall for his age, I suppose.

60
00:04:54,943 --> 00:04:55,943
That’s a nice sofa!

61
00:04:55,943 --> 00:05:03,590
Can you say the sentences?

62
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,729
Pause the video and try.

63
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:09,400
Focus on pronouncing the links correctly!

64
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:17,300
Okay, to review, when one word ends with a
consonant sound, and the next word starts

65
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,900
with the same consonant sound, we link the
sounds.

66
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:34,960
But, there are two exceptions to this rule:
we don’t link /tʃ/ or /dʒ/ sounds.

67
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,100
For example: 'each choice'; 'orange juice'.

68
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,490
In these examples, you can’t link the two
consonant sounds.

69
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,200
You have to pronounce two sounds.

70
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,950
Try to pronounce the second sound immediately
after you release the first sound.

71
00:05:53,950 --> 00:06:03,330
This will help you to speak more fluently:
'each choice'; 'orange juice'.

72
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,720
Let’s try them in a sentence:

73
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,440
Each choice you make is important.

74
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,110
Would you like some orange juice?

75
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,449
Practice these sentences, and see how fluent
you can make them!

76
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:28,270
Okay, let’s look at one more point about
linking consonant sounds.

77
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:33,830
Part two: linking similar consonant sounds.

78
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:40,080
You already know that you can link two of
the same consonant sounds together.

79
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,630
You can also link similar consonant sounds.

80
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:51,060
For example:
'cheese sandwich'; 'breathe through'.

81
00:06:51,060 --> 00:07:00,750
'Cheese' ends with a /z/ sound, and 'sandwich'
starts with a /s/ sound.

82
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,270
These aren’t the same, but they are similar.

83
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:11,919
The only difference between /s/ and /z/ is
that /z/ is voiced.

84
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,220
Everything else is the same.

85
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,320
That means we can link the sounds.

86
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,410
Try saying 'cheese sandwich.'

87
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:31,879
When you say the /z/ on the end of 'cheese',
your tongue is behind your top teeth.

88
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:42,440
Leave your tongue there and change to
/s/ without moving anything, then say 'sandwich'.

89
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,139
Cheese sandwich.

90
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:48,009
It’s the same idea with 'breathe through.'

91
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:58,060
Breathe ends with /ð/, and through starts
with /θ/.

92
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:04,240
These are also a voiced and unvoiced pair.

93
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,620
Say 'breathe' and put your tongue between
your teeth to pronounce /ð/.

94
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:19,400
Then, leave everything where it is and pronounce
/θ/, and then say 'through'.

95
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,440
Let’s try these examples in sentences:

96
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,800
Get me a cheese sandwich, would you?

97
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,950
Do you have to breathe through your mouth
like that?

98
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,020
Try saying the sentences.

99
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:43,930
Remember: there shouldn’t be any break between
the linked words!

100
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:50,730
So, what other consonant pairs can you link
like this?

101
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:59,010
You can also link:
/d/ and /t/ I need two kilos of shrimp.

102
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:08,200
/k/ and /g/ The water was a kind of dark green
colour.

103
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:16,330
/p/ and /b/ I sleep better if the room’s
really dark.

104
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:23,950
/f/ and /v/ Have you packed enough vests?

105
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:29,980
It doesn’t matter which way round the sounds
are.

106
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:35,970
You can link /d/ to /t/ or /t/ to /d/.

107
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,390
For example:

108
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,060
I need two kilos of shrimp.

109
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,560
She asked Dave what would happen.

110
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,890
Now it’s your turn!

111
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,270
Repeat the sentences after me.

112
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,080
Focus on the links:

113
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,310
I need two kilos of shrimp.

114
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,740
The water was a kind of dark green colour.

115
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:10,270
I sleep better if the room’s really dark.

116
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:16,020
Have you packed enough vests?

117
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:23,760
So now you know the most important points
about linking consonants together, but what

118
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,100
about vowels?

119
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,330
Part three: linking consonants to vowels.

120
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,880
Let’s go back to our first example sentence:

121
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,180
Do you remember that time when Anna and Amy
fell in the swimming pool?

122
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,220
Think about the words 'when Anna'.

123
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,540
What happens?

124
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,580
We link the consonant onto the vowel.

125
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,020
Together, the words are pronounced /we'nænə/.

126
00:10:54,020 --> 00:11:03,020
You can do this if one word ends with a consonant
sound, and the next word begins with a vowel

127
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,020
sound.

128
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,210
Look at the sentence again.

129
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:14,730
Can you find two more examples like this?

130
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,990
You can also link 'and Amy fell in'.

131
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:24,070
Try saying the full sentence with these vowel
links:

132
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:30,280
Do you remember that time when Anna and Amy
fell in the swimming pool?

133
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:39,110
If you find it difficult to pronounce the
links, slow down.

134
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,800
You don’t need to speak fast to link correctly.

135
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,760
Let’s practice with some different examples.

136
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,350
Look at three sentences.

137
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,270
Can you find the consonant-vowel links?

138
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,640
There’s an elephant in the garden.

139
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:01,540
I ate an apple and two pears.

140
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:08,620
These are the best tomatoes I’ve ever had.

141
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:15,720
There are three consonant-vowel links to find
in each sentence.

142
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,980
Can you see them?

143
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,080
Let’s see where the links are:

144
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,080
There’s an elephant in the garden.

145
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,801
I ate an apple and two pears.

146
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:30,801
These are the best tomatoes I’ve ever had.

147
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:37,260
Can you pronounce the links in these sentences?

148
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:49,380
If you find it difficult to pronounce consonant-vowel
links, there’s a simple trick you can use.

149
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:55,690
Imagine that the consonant is at the start
of the second word.

150
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,740
For example, try saying:

151
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,110
There’s an elephant in the garden.

152
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:07,240
I ate an apple and two pears.

153
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:14,240
These are the best tomatoes I’ve ever had.

154
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,750
Looks weird, right?

155
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,680
But many English learners find this useful.

156
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,420
Remember, we write the words separately, with
spaces between them, but we don’t pronounce

157
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,760
them that way.

158
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,610
In speech, the consonant doesn’t ‘belong’
to the first word—you can easily think of

159
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:40,550
the consonant sound being at the start of
the second word.

160
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,840
Let’s look at our last way to link.

161
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,490
Part four: linking two vowel sounds.

162
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:55,590
Let’s look at one more phrase: He asked
me for two apples.

163
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:03,710
Here, there are links between ‘he asked’
and ‘two apples’.

164
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:10,670
You can link two vowel sounds like this: add
a consonant sound in the middle to connect

165
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,980
the sounds.

166
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,780
You can add /w/ or /j/ depending on the two
vowel sounds.

167
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,100
For example:

168
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,430
'Two apples'.

169
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:30,180
We link the sounds with /w/: two apples.

170
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,210
'He asked'.

171
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:37,320
We link the sounds with /j/: he asked.

172
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:47,080
Let’s try these in some sentences:
There are two apples in the bowl.

173
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,180
He asked for a glass of water.

174
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:57,030
You’re probably thinking: how do I know
which consonant sound to add?

175
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,760
When do I use /w/ or /j/?

176
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,990
There are rules, but the rules aren’t very
practical to use.

177
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:13,390
The best way is simply to relax and try to
read the words as fluently as possible.

178
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:18,220
You will use the correct sound automatically.

179
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:23,270
Remember that linking makes it easier to speak
fluently.

180
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:28,950
If you’re not sure which sound to use to
link two vowels, simply try them all.

181
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:36,360
The easiest one to say is the correct one.

182
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:43,030
Let’s practice: which sound should you add
to link these words?

183
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:48,030
'See Andrew'; 'go out'.

184
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:57,710
Remember: if you’re not sure, just try saying
the words quickly and fluently.

185
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:02,100
Pause the video if you want to think about
it.

186
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,230
Here are the answers:

187
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:10,180
See Andrew: add a /j/ sound.

188
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:16,130
Go_w_out: add a /w/ sound.

189
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,100
Let’s practice these in sentences:

190
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,440
I’m going to see Andrew this weekend.

191
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,320
Shall we go out to get something to eat?

192
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,680
So now you know all the ways to link words
in English.

193
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,090
Part five: review.

194
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:46,411
There are three basic ways to link words in
English: consonant to consonant, consonant

195
00:16:46,411 --> 00:16:53,850
to vowel, and vowel to vowel.

196
00:16:53,850 --> 00:17:00,540
You can link two consonants if one word ends
with a consonant sound, and the next word

197
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,680
starts with the same sound, or a similar sound.

198
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:12,150
In this case, the two words ‘share’ the
consonant sound.

199
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:18,510
You can link any consonant to any vowel.

200
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:24,020
It can be helpful to imagine that the consonant
‘belongs’ to the second word.

201
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:34,230
You can link two vowel sounds together by
adding a consonant between them.

202
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:41,400
You need to add /w/ or /j/ depending on the
two vowel sounds.

203
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:48,310
If you’re not sure how to link two vowels,
just relax and try out the different combinations.

204
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:56,310
Remember that linking is supposed to make
speaking easier, not harder!

205
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,560
That’s the end of the lesson.

206
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:05,750
I hope you learned something new about English
pronunciation!
