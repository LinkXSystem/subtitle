00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,360
Hello, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,970
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,570
In this lesson, you can learn about the present
simple verb tense in English.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,559
How many ways do you know to use the present
simple?

5
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:21,110
The present simple doesn’t just have one
or two uses; there are at least eight common

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,560
uses, and many more special cases.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,500
In this lesson, you can learn all about the
present simple tense.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,070
Beginners can learn simple ways to use this
verb form, and more advanced students can

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,370
learn about more complex uses of the present
simple.

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,370
Ready?

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,430
OK, let’s start!

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,520
First question: how can you form the present
simple?

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,190
To use the present simple, you need to remember
three things:

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,630
First, add an 's' or 'es' to the verb in the
third person singular, for example, after

15
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,170
'he', 'she', or 'it'.

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:09,299
Make negatives using 'don't' or 'doesn't';
use 'doesn't' again for the 3rd person - after

17
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,920
'he', 'she' or 'it'.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,409
Make questions with 'do' or 'does.'

19
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,409
For example:

20
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:20,450
"I visit them once a week."

21
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,990
"She visits them once a week."

22
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,209
We add an 's' to the verb after he/she/it.

23
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:29,670
"I have a lot of things to do."

24
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,740
"I don't have a lot of things to do."

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,200
We make negatives with .don't'.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,049
"I don't have much time."

27
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:42,119
"He doesn't have much time."

28
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,079
We make negatives with 'doesn't' after he/she/it.

29
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,759
"You have a big family."

30
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:52,719
"Do you have a big family?"

31
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,759
We make questions with 'do'.

32
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,560
"Do you live in this building?"

33
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,950
"Does she live in this building?"

34
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,170
For the 3rd person, we make questions with
'does'.

35
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,030
You can see that when we use 'does' or 'doesn't',
we don't add 's' to the verb.

36
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:19,850
OK, that shows you how to form the present
simple, but how can you use it?

37
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,290
Let's look at the different ways you can use
this verb form.

38
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,250
Part two: talking about a regular action.

39
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,890
This is one of the most common uses of the
present simple.

40
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,900
Let's just look at some examples:

41
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,700
"She calls her parents every week."

42
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,370
"I don't often go to the gym."

43
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,599
Or, "Do you always eat so quickly?"

44
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,430
In all of these sentences, we are talking
about actions which happen (or don't happen)

45
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,430
regularly.

46
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,820
These actions are not happening at this moment.

47
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:59,210
This is a simple use of the present simple,
which you maybe knew already.

48
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,180
But we’ve only just started.

49
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,440
How else can you use the present simple?

50
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,320
Do you know any other ways?

51
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Let's look.

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,730
Part three: talking about general truths.

53
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,140
If you want to talk about something which
is generally true, you will also need the

54
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,380
present simple.

55
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,310
For example:

56
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,710
"The Moon goes around the Earth."

57
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,500
"The Nile is the longest river in the world."

58
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:34,400
Or, "Elephants live for 60 or 70 years on
average."

59
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,690
These things are generally true because they
aren’t just true at one moment.

60
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,980
They were true 100 years ago; they’re true
today, and they’ll be true 100 years in

61
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,160
the future.

62
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,940
Compare this to the previous idea: talking
about regular actions.

63
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,160
In both cases, we use the present simple to
talk about something which is true not just

64
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,730
at this moment, but also in the future and
the past.

65
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,500
This idea is an important part of the meaning
of the present simple.

66
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,180
We'll see it again.

67
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,910
Part four: talking about states and situations.

68
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,400
'Throwing' is an action.

69
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,169
It’s something which can be happening at
one moment.

70
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:26,530
A question: are all verbs actions?

71
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,680
Think about a verb like 'seem'.

72
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,880
Is 'seeming' an action?

73
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,400
Can you say, "You’re seeming very quiet
today?"

74
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,449
No, and no.

75
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:42,349
Verbs like 'seem' describe states, not actions.

76
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:47,270
We use the present simple to talk about all
states in the present.

77
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,509
For example:

78
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:50,860
"You seem a bit quiet today."

79
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,650
"He has a lot of experience in his subject."

80
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:00,749
Or, "Why does this one cost more than the
others?"

81
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:06,020
Many verbs which describe states, like 'seem'
or 'cost' can only be used in simple tenses.

82
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,539
They don’t exist in continuous tenses.

83
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:15,860
Again, you can see the same idea of something
which is true not just now, at this moment,

84
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,919
but also in the future and the past.

85
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,849
If you say, "He has a lot of experience in
his subject," that means that he had a lot

86
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:30,150
of experience last week, and he’ll have
a lot of experience next week, too.

87
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,870
It’s not just about this moment.

88
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:41,689
Part five: using the present simple with verbs
of sensing, feeling, thinking or speaking.

89
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:48,779
With many verbs of sensing (like 'hear', 'see'
or 'smell'), feeling (like 'like', 'love'

90
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:56,770
or 'hate') thinking (like 'know', 'realise'
or 'remember') or speaking (like 'promise',

91
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,689
'admit' or 'advise'), we use the present simple.

92
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:06,639
This is because many of these verbs describe
states, and the present simple is used to

93
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,430
talk about states, as you saw just now.

94
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,349
Let's look at some more examples:

95
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:14,849
"This cheese smells a bit strange."

96
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:17,820
"I don't like going shopping."

97
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,569
"Do you realise what you're doing?"

98
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,960
"I promise it won't happen again."

99
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,949
In all of these sentences, only the present
simple is possible.

100
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:34,120
You can't say, "Are you realising what you're
doing?"

101
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,960
Or, "I'm promising it won’t happen again."

102
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,340
Part six: talking about long-lasting situations.

103
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,259
If you say,
"She lives with her friend."

104
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:48,460
Or,

105
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,629
"She’s living with her friend."

106
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:54,560
Are they the same?

107
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,379
If not, what’s the difference?

108
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:59,759
They’re different.

109
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,469
If you say, "She lives with her friend," with
the present simple, this suggests that the

110
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:08,550
situation is permanent, or at least long-lasting.

111
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,479
She’s not just staying with her friend for
a few weeks.

112
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,129
She lives with her friend, permanently.

113
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:22,150
If you say, "She’s living with her friend,"
with the present continuous, this suggests

114
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,439
that the situation is temporary.

115
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,719
Maybe she’s just staying with her friend
while she looks for her own place.

116
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:35,629
When we use the present simple to talk about
a situation, it suggests that the situation

117
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:43,789
has continued for a long time, and/or that
we expect this situation to continue for a

118
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:46,689
long time into the future.

119
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:51,490
In some cases, it's possible to use either
the present simple or the present continuous

120
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,939
in the same sentence, but the meanings would
be different.

121
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:01,919
Using the present simple shows a situation
is long-lasting or permanent, while using

122
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,559
the present continuous shows that a situation
is just temporary.

123
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:07,699
For example:

124
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:12,589
"He works for a small design company."

125
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:13,960
This is his career.

126
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
This is his job.

127
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,939
He’ll probably stay there a long time.

128
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:21,729
"He's working for a small design company."

129
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:23,729
He works there at the moment.

130
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,099
He might change jobs soon.

131
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:31,089
Another example:
"I go to the gym every week."

132
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:36,060
That means I do this every week, every month,
all year.

133
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,280
Next month, I’ll still be going to the gym.

134
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,190
"I'm going to the gym every week."

135
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,100
That means I’m doing this at the moment.

136
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,680
Next month, you won't see me there!

137
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,780
In all of these sentences, both forms are
possible (simple or continuous), but the present

138
00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:01,130
simple shows that these situations are long-lasting,
while the present continuous shows that these

139
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,660
situations probably won't continue for a long
time.

140
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:12,630
Okay, part seven - lots of parts! - use the
present simple to tell jokes or stories in

141
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,640
conversational English.

142
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,960
Imagine you’re telling a story to your friends.

143
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,460
What verb form would you use?

144
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,420
You should use the past, right?

145
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:29,450
After all, you’re talking about a story,
something which happened in the past.

146
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,830
Shouldn't you use a past verb form?

147
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,830
Hmm...

148
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,430
That’s logical, but it’s not always true.

149
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,870
We often use the present simple to tell stories
or jokes, even for things which happened in

150
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,370
the past.

151
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,530
This is only possible in conversational English.

152
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,570
Why do we do this?

153
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:53,210
Using the present simple instead of the past
makes the story sound more direct and exciting.

154
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,640
For example:

155
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,850
So, I see this guy who looks just like Johnny
Depp, and I go up to talk to him, but then

156
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,300
I trip and throw my drink all over him!

157
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,060
He gives me this look, like I'm a complete
idiot, and just walks away.

158
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:15,390
Similarly, the present simple is often used
in newspaper headlines, even for things which

159
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,890
happened in the past.

160
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,640
For example:

161
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:26,360
"Prime Minister resigns"
"Scientists discover new element"

162
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,260
Next, we also use the present simple in commentary.

163
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,250
What’s commentary?

164
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:43,000
Commentary means describing something as it’s
happening, usually on TV or on the radio.

165
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,810
For example, sports matches have commentators,
who describe the match to listeners or viewers.

166
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,640
Commentators use the present simple to talk
about shorter actions which are happening

167
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,470
at that moment.

168
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,470
For example:

169
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,150
"He passes, he shoots…

170
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,190
He hits the post!"

171
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,560
"She serves, but Williams makes a great return."

172
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:11,730
"The prince waits at the altar, while the
princess walks slowly up the aisle."

173
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,720
This might seem strange.

174
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,180
Commentary describes something which is happening
now, so you might think we should use the

175
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,920
present continuous.

176
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,000
Commentary does use the present continuous,
but mostly for longer actions.

177
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,480
For example:

178
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,990
"He’s warming up and getting ready to come
on the pitch."

179
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,220
"The players are taking a break while the
medic treats her leg."

180
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,140
Normally, we use the present simple for longer
actions and the present continuous for shorter

181
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,850
actions.

182
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:51,690
But in commentary, the opposite is true; the
present simple describes shorter actions,

183
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,070
the continuous is used for longer actions.

184
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,670
OK, you’re nearly finished.

185
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,910
We have one more use of the present simple.

186
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,910
What is it?

187
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:06,040
Let’s look:
Part nine: we use the present simple for future

188
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,220
schedules.

189
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,230
So, you can also the present simple to talk
about the future.

190
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,850
How?

191
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,380
We use the present simple to talk about things
in the future which are on a timetable or

192
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,610
schedule.

193
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:27,470
This includes things like trains, planes and
other public transport; meetings and appointments;

194
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,260
classes and so on, things like this.

195
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,340
For example:

196
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,650
"Class starts at 10.00."

197
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,020
"The plane arrives at 12.20 at night."

198
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,810
"What time does the meeting start?"

199
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,970
In all of these sentences, we are talking
about the future, but because we are talking

200
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,760
about timetables or schedules, we use the
present simple.

201
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,270
OK, let's review.

202
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,270
Wow!

203
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,980
Lots of information in this lesson.

204
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,320
Don’t worry if you don’t remember it all.

205
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,650
You can always review the video if you need
to.

206
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,810
It will still be here.

207
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:08,930
I hope you can see that the present simple
is actually a very flexible and powerful verb

208
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,500
form.

209
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,940
You can use it to express many, many different
ideas.

210
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,940
However, if you want to use the present simple
in all these ways, you need to understand

211
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,440
the different meanings.

212
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,120
There isn’t one answer to the question “What
does the present simple do?”

213
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,160
There are many answers!

214
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,520
That’s the end of the lesson.

215
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,870
Thanks very much for watching!

216
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,600
