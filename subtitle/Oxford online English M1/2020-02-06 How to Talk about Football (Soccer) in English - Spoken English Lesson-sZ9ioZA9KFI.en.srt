00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,960
Hi, I’m Marie.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,640
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,800
In this lesson you can learn how to talk about
football in English.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,930
Do you play football?

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,520
Do you watch football, or support a team?

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,839
You can learn useful language to talk about
who you support, talk about a football match,

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,759
and more!

8
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:30,160
Before we start, check out our website: Oxford
Online English dot com.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,369
Are you watching on YouTube?

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,399
Look in the video description for links.

which includes the script for you to read,

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,059
and a quiz so you can test your vocabulary
skills!

13
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,329
You can also book online lessons with one
of our professional teachers, in case you

14
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,520
need more help with your English.

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,519
Our teachers can help you with spoken English,
writing, pronunciation, IELTS preparation,

16
00:00:57,519 --> 00:00:58,920
or whatever else you need.

now.

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:23,000
OK, let’s talk about football!

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,810
You’re a Villa fan, right?

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,810
Villa?

24
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:26,810
No!

25
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,810
Spurs.

26
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,540
I’m Tottenham through and through.

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,540
Oh, really?

28
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,649
I like Spurs.

29
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:34,280
They’ve done well recently.

30
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,500
They’ve been top four for the last few seasons,
right?

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,329
Yeah, they’re always there or thereabouts,
but it’d be nice to actually turn that into

32
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:44,990
some trophies one day.

33
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,200
We haven’t won anything major for a long
time.

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,540
Who do you support?

35
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,700
Newcastle.

36
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,580
My Dad’s from there, and he took me to games
when I was younger, so I’ve stuck with them.

37
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,320
I’m not a fanatic, but I try to go to at
least a couple of games a year, although it’s

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,619
not much fun at the moment.

39
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,259
They’ve got a good side though, no?

40
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,270
Yeah, it’s not that.

41
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,580
The owners won’t invest, so they’ve been
underperforming for the last few years.

42
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,950
It’s frustrating.

43
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,870
What do you think for this year?

44
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,380
You think City will win it again?

45
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,000
Probably, though I think Liverpool have a
shot, too.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,569
How do you think Spurs will do?

47
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:26,910
Well, I’d be happy enough with 4th, and
very happy with 3rd.

48
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,920
We need to be more consistent, though.

49
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,920
Last year we dropped too many points in easy
games.

50
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,989
What about Newcastle?

51
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:39,010
Realistically, if we finish in the top half
of the table it’ll be a good season.

52
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,460
I just hope we don’t get relegated again…

53
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,300
Are you a football fan?

54
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,980
Who do you support?

55
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,470
You could answer this by saying ‘I support
…’, as in ‘I support Manchester United,’

56
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,120
or ‘I support Barcelona.’

57
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,580
Or, you could just give the club name.

58
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,940
In the English Premier League, club names
are often shortened.

59
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,440
Look at five short names for Premier League
clubs.

60
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,200
Do you know which clubs they are?

61
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,800
Did you know?

62
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,159
Here are the answers.

63
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:25,379
If you say ‘City’ or ‘United’ when
talking about English football, most people

64
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:30,000
will understand ‘Manchester City’ and
‘Manchester United’.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,810
There are many clubs which have ‘City’
or ‘United’ in their name, but these are

66
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,200
historically two of the biggest.

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,599
Anyway, what about your club?

68
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,159
Look at three questions.

69
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,939
Think about how you could answer these questions.

70
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:55,879
Before you do, let’s see some language from
the dialogue which might help.

71
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,329
Look at the highlighted words and phrases.

72
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,290
Do you remember how they were used?

73
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,680
Could you explain what they mean?

74
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,150
‘Through and through’ means that you give
100% to your club.

75
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,060
If you say ‘I’m Tottenham through and
through’, you mean you are—and always

76
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,500
have been—a big Tottenham fan.

77
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,750
A ‘fanatic’ in this context means a very
enthusiastic fan.

78
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,010
If you say ‘I’m not a fanatic’, you
mean that you support your team, but maybe

79
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,540
it’s not a big part of your life.

80
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,840
‘There or thereabouts’ means ‘near the
top, but not the best’.

81
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,170
If your team is there or thereabouts, you
mean that they’re close to the top teams,

82
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,940
but not one of the best in the country.

83
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,200
Maybe you finish 3rd, 4th or 5th every year.

84
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,540
If your team underperforms, it gets worse
results than you would expect.

85
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:04,920
Maybe you have many great players, but you
don’t win as often as you should.

86
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,180
Top teams need to be *consistent*.

87
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,720
This means they play at a high level every
week.

88
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,450
The opposite is inconsistent.

89
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,980
Inconsistent teams might play well one week,
and badly the next.

90
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:25,970
Finally, if your team gets relegated, they
finish in one of the bottom places in the

91
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,630
league, and so they drop down to the league
below.

92
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,940
Getting relegated is one of the worst things
that can happen to a team!

93
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,080
So now, what about your team?

94
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:44,350
Look at the questions you saw before.

95
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,750
Think about how you could answer them.

96
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,220
Maybe you could use some of the language you
just saw.

97
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,900
Pause the video, think about your answers,
and practise saying them out loud.

98
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,320
OK?

99
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
Could you do it?

100
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,100
If it’s difficult, remember that you can
go back and watch the dialogue and explanations

101
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,360
again.

102
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,050
Next, imagine that you just watched an exciting
match.

103
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,540
How could you talk about it?

104
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,140
Let’s see!

105
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,470
Wow!

106
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,800
What a game!

107
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,420
Yeah, real end-to-end stuff.

108
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,430
5-5?

109
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,500
How often do you see a 10-goal draw?

110
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,000
I thought West Brom were out of it, but they
kept coming back.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,680
To be 5-2 down against a team like United,
and score three…

112
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,520
They never stopped fighting.

113
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,750
On the one hand, it’s disappointing that
we blew a three-goal lead, but it was such

114
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,960
a great match that I can’t be too unhappy.

115
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,660
In the end, I think a draw was the right result.

116
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:50,850
Obviously I’d have loved West Brom to win,
but neither team deserved to lose.

117
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,890
True, though your lot were so bad in the first
half.

118
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,380
I don’t know what happened at half time,
but you looked like a completely different

119
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,930
side after the interval.

120
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,400
Yeah, I know what you mean.

121
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,440
I think United sat back a bit too much in
the second half, too.

122
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,610
Maybe they thought they had won it in the
first half.

123
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,160
Yeah, we didn’t look as sharp in the second
half.

124
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,460
Here’s a question: what’s the best football
match you can remember?

125
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:27,910
At the start of the dialogue, you heard the
phrase ‘end-to-end stuff.’

126
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:35,130
You can use this to describe a match which
was fast-going and full of action.

127
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:41,530
Look at some more phrases from the dialogue,
but with some words missing.

128
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:47,250
Can you remember the missing words?

129
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,960
Remember that you can go back and listen to
the dialogue again if you want.

130
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,630
Are you ready?

131
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:58,010
Let’s see the answers.

132
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,560
Can you explain what these phrases mean?

133
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,300
‘Out of it’ means that you don’t have
a chance.

134
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,250
If a team is three goals down, normally you
can say they’re out of it, because most

135
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,710
teams don’t win from that position.

136
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,940
You can also use ‘in’ with the opposite
meaning.

137
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:23,520
For example ‘They may be a goal down, but
they’re still in the game.’

138
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,850
This means that even though they’re losing,
they still have a chance to win.

139
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:35,500
If a team recovers from a losing position
and gets a draw or a win, then they come back.

140
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,770
‘Come back’ can be a verb or a noun.

141
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:43,020
Look at two examples.

142
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,260
‘Blow a three-goal lead’ means to lose
a winning position.

143
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:54,940
‘We blew a three-goal lead’ means we were
three goals ahead, but then the other team

144
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,260
came back to win or draw.

145
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,900
In general, if you say ‘you blew it’,
it means ‘you failed’.

146
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,120
It’s conversational.

147
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,980
‘Your lot’ means ‘the team you support.’

148
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:15,600
It’s also conversational, but it’s quite
common among UK football fans.

149
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,400
If a team sits back, they don’t try to attack,
and maybe they don’t give 100%.

150
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,840
Sometimes, teams sit back when they’re already
winning, because they don’t think they need

151
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,000
more goals.

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,470
Another conversational expression which is
popular recently is ‘park the bus’, which

153
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,900
has a similar meaning.

154
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:45,060
If a team parks the bus, they defend deep,
and don’t move players forwards.

155
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:51,460
Saying that a team parks the bus is usually
a criticism, because it describes a style

156
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:57,840
of play which is often boring to watch, even
if it’s effective sometimes.

157
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:03,610
Finally, if your team looks sharp, they are
playing well and moving fast.

158
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,250
‘Sharp’ means something like ‘focused’
or ‘dangerous’.

159
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:14,000
You want your team to look sharp, especially
if they have a big match, like a cup final.

160
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,250
Has your team ever played in a cup final,
or won any trophies?

161
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:24,820
Let’s see how you can talk about that next.

162
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,150
Big night for you on Thursday, right?

163
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,540
The Europa Final?

164
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,040
Yeah, I’m looking forward to it.

165
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,460
You think you’ll win?

166
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,800
Could do.

167
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,440
I think both teams are quite evenly matched.

168
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,700
In a knockout competition, you’ve always
got a chance.

169
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,500
We’ll see!

170
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,240
It’d be a big deal though, wouldn’t it?

171
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,620
First European trophy?

172
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,080
Yeah, that’d be nice.

173
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,600
Plus, it gets us into the Champions League
next year.

174
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,570
That would be a first, too.

175
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,120
Didn’t you win the FA cup a couple of years
ago?

176
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,080
No, we got to the final, but then we lost
in extra time.

177
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,290
We haven’t won anything in recent years
except the League Cup, and even that was five

178
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,290
years ago.

179
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,920
I think I remember that match.

180
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,350
Didn’t you win on penalties?

181
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,460
Yeah, it was a long shootout.

182
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,770
It went to 10-9 or 9-8 or something crazy.

183
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,750
Well, a win’s a win!

184
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:27,350
Generally, football teams take part in two
kinds of competition: leagues, like the Premier

185
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,830
League, La Liga or Serie A, and cup competitions.

186
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,740
Cup competitions can be domestic or international.

187
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:41,350
English football has two cup competitions:
the League Cup and the FA Cup.

188
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,010
The FA Cup is generally considered more prestigious.

189
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:51,120
Other European leagues mostly have one domestic
cup, but a few countries have two.

190
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,380
Then, you have international cups.

191
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,710
In Europe, the most famous is the Champions
League.

192
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,320
The Europa League is the second-tier cup.

193
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,680
Cups are knockout competitions, meaning that
in most cases, if you lose one match, you’re

194
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,380
out.

195
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:15,480
Some cups have a league phase, like the group
stage of the Champions League, or the World

196
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,140
Cup.

197
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,980
In a knockout match, what happens if it’s
a draw?

198
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,779
The match might go to extra time.

199
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:30,660
If that doesn’t produce a result, then you
have a penalty shootout.

200
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:37,960
Look at two sentences:
Notice that you win or lose *in* extra time,

201
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,720
but *on* penalties.

202
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,240
Now, let’s practise!

203
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,910
Look at three questions.

204
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,190
Can you answer these questions?

205
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,090
Like before, pause the video and make your
answers.

206
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,850
Read them out loud, write them down, or do
both!

207
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:04,770
Let’s look at one more thing: talking about
players and transfers.

208
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,260
You looking forward to the new season?

209
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,680
Yeah, of course, though I’m less optimistic
than I could have been.

210
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,280
We didn’t have much luck in the transfer
window.

211
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,330
You still have a good team, though.

212
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,340
Sure, but we’ve lost some players.

213
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:23,220
Kanté’s gone, Schwarzer’s gone, and I
don’t think Riyad Mahrez will stay for long.

214
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:29,450
Plus, with injuries, we needed at least one
centre back, a holding midfielder, a winger,

215
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,600
and probably more.

216
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,420
But you still have Vardy.

217
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,440
He’s still a top striker.

218
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,820
Yeah, no doubt.

219
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,660
He’s getting on, though.

220
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,200
He might have one or two more good seasons
in him, but we need to think about replacing

221
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,260
him, too.

222
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,960
Well, count your blessings.

223
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,470
We have a transfer ban, and our keeper’s
injured, so we might not even have a recognised

224
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,080
goalie for our first match.

225
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,120
You have so much depth in your squad, though.

226
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,160
I think you’ll be OK.

227
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:08,260
Here’s a question: how many football positions
can you name in English?

228
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,880
How many did you get?

229
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:19,120
In general, you have a goalkeeper, defenders,
midfielders and forwards.

230
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,230
In each group, you have more specific words.

231
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:27,780
For example, defenders can be centre-backs,
left-backs, or right-backs, and there are

232
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,260
other positions, too.

233
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,660
Midfielders can be classified by both where
they play and their role.

234
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,240
A ‘role’ can be defensive or attacking.

235
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,620
For example, a holding midfielder is a defensive
midfielder who plays in the centre.

236
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:52,370
A winger is usually an attacking midfielder
who plays on the left or the right side.

237
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:58,640
There are many other possible midfield positions,
depending on the team’s tactics.

238
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,780
Forwards can be strikers, whose job is to
score.

239
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:10,020
Some teams might play a second forward behind
the main striker, or wide forwards, who play

240
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:14,740
on either side of the main striker.

241
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,740
What about your team?

242
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,380
Who’s the best defender, midfielder and
forward?

243
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,960
Which players would you like to see in your
team?

244
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:35,400
Let’s see some more phrases from the dialogue
you can use to talk about players and transfers.

245
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,940
Can you explain what these mean?

246
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,100
‘Top’ means ‘one of the best’.

247
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,040
‘Getting on’ means ‘getting older’.

248
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,840
It’s conversational.

249
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:55,870
Of course, getting older is relative here;
footballers, especially forwards, often start

250
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:04,110
getting slower after 30, and few are
playing at a high level after 35.

251
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,220
A transfer ban is when a club is not allowed
to buy new players.

252
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:14,840
If a club breaks the rules around transfers,
they might get a transfer ban for a few months.

253
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,460
Recently in the Premier League, Chelsea were
given a 12-month transfer ban for breaking

254
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:26,020
the rules on approaching players aged under
18.

255
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:31,800
Finally, sentence four means that the club
has more than 11 good players.

256
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:38,290
If your club has a deep squad, it means that
injuries or losing one or two players won’t

257
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:44,210
be a problem, because there are other good
players to take over.

258
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,690
What about you?

259
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:51,130
Who do you support, and who are your favourite
players right now?

260
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,320
Share your opinions in the comments!

261
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,900
Thanks for watching!

262
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,340
See you next time!
