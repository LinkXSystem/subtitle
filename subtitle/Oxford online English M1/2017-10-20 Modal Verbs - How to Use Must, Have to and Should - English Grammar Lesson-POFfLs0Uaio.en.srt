00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:03,399
Hi, I'm Kasia.

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:05,120
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,750
In this lesson, you can learn about the modal
verbs must, have to and should.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,600
Do you know the difference between 'must',
'have to' and 'should'?

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,900
English learners often mix up these three
verbs.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:28,779
In this lesson, you can learn how to use must,
have to and should correctly in English.

7
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:35,930
Must and have to are both used to talk about
obligations: things you cannot choose not

8
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,250
to do.

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,570
For example:

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,789
We must talk to her before she leaves.

11
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:47,940
I have to go into work early tomorrow.

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,370
If you say, We must talk to her before she
leaves, you mean that you think this is very

13
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,550
important, and you need to do it.

14
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:06,210
When you say, I have to go into work early
tomorrow, you mean that you have no choice.

15
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,560
These are both obligations, but they’re
slightly different.

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,490
Can you see how they’re different?

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,810
The first obligation is more personal, which
is why you use must.

18
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,100
You feel that it’s necessary and important
to talk to her before she leaves.

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,180
The obligation comes from you and your feelings.

20
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,860
What about have to?

21
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:37,370
The second obligation is more situational,
which is why you use have to.

22
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:44,000
It’s necessary to go into work early tomorrow,
maybe because you have to meet a client, or

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,990
you have some important work to finish.

24
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:53,170
The obligation comes from the situation, not
from you.

25
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,450
Let’s see some more examples:

26
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,729
I must pay him back like I promised.

27
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:06,860
--> You made a promise, and now it’s important
to you personally to keep your promise and

28
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,990
pay him back.

29
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,270
He has to do a lot of homework every week.

30
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:20,600
--> He needs to do a lot of homework because
the school gives him a lot of homework.

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,750
It’s rare to use must to talk about obligations
in spoken English.

32
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,940
Native English speakers use have to much more
in conversation.

33
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,610
However, you can use must to talk about obligations
in formal or written English.

34
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,030
For example:

35
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,100
All passengers must have a valid ticket.

36
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:46,500
Candidates must arrive no later than five
minutes before the scheduled start time.

37
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,100
Want an easy answer to this?

38
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:55,150
Here’s an easy answer: use have to when
you speak.

39
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:02,050
Using must to talk about obligations can sound
very formal and strange in spoken English.

40
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,580
If you use have to when you speak, you’ll
never be wrong!

41
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,710
You can use must to talk about obligations
in your written English if you’re writing

42
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,400
something more formal.

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,260
This doesn’t mean that you won’t hear
must in conversation; actually, you’ll hear

44
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,250
it a lot.

45
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,250
Why is this?

46
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,380
Didn’t we just tell you not to use must
in spoken English?

47
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,040
It’s because must has many other meanings,
too.

48
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,400
Using must to talk about obligations is rare
in spoken English, but you can use it for

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,010
many other things.

50
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,900
Okay, you’ve seen how must and have to are
different.

51
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,700
What about mustn’t and don’t have to?

52
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,220
Wait, what?

53
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,260
We just talked about must and have to.

54
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,230
Isn’t this the same?

55
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,520
Not at all.

56
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,850
Must and have to aren’t exactly the same,
but they are quite similar.

57
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:04,690
However, the negatives—mustn’t and don’t
have to—are completely different.

58
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,950
Look at two sentences:

59
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,620
Visitors must not touch the paintings.

60
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,020
You don’t have to be here before ten.

61
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,760
Can you tell the difference?

62
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,640
Must not means that something is forbidden.

63
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,240
You are not allowed to do this.

64
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,511
If you’re in a museum, and the sign says
Visitors must not touch the paintings, then

65
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:34,540
don’t touch the paintings!

66
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,410
Don’t have to means that something is not
necessary.

67
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,840
You can choose to do something or not.

68
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,510
If we have plans, and I tell you, You don’t
have to be here before ten, then you can be

69
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,910
here before ten if you want.

70
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,010
You can come at nine, at eight, or whenever
you want.

71
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,730
It’s your choice.

72
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,810
Let’s see some more examples:

73
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,000
Passengers must not talk to the driver while
the bus is moving.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,160
--> It’s forbidden to talk to the driver
while the bus is moving; you aren’t allowed

75
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,630
to do this.

76
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,090
You don’t have to finish it today.

77
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,730
--> You can finish it today if you want to,
but you can also leave it until later if you

78
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,730
want.

79
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,750
It’s your choice.

80
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:26,200
Like must, must not is more common in formal
or written English.

81
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,100
In spoken English, it’s more common to use
can’t.

82
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,360
For example, you might see a sign saying:

83
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,130
Mobile phones must not be used while driving.

84
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,040
But, if you were talking, you’d probably
say:

85
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,880
You can’t use your phone while you’re
driving.

86
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,620
On the other hand, don’t have to is common
in both spoken and written English.

87
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:02,650
So now you’ve seen the difference between
must and have to, but what about should?

88
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,990
Remember that must and have to can be used
to talk about obligations.

89
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,150
Should is different.

90
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,840
You use should to give advice or express your
opinion.

91
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,360
For example:

92
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,300
You should go to bed earlier.

93
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,979
Then you wouldn’t feel so tired all the
time.

94
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:20,979
--> This is my advice.

95
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:23,900
I think it’s better for you to do this,
but it isn’t necessary.

96
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:29,020
It’s not an obligation, so you still have
a choice.

97
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,210
He should do more work if he wants to get
promoted.

98
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,210
--> This is my opinion.

99
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:41,030
I don’t think he needs to do it, and I don’t
necessarily care if he does this or not.

100
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,170
You can’t use should to talk about obligations
or rules.

101
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,930
When you say,

102
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,100
You should…

103
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,720
You mean that the person has a choice.

104
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,160
You’re giving your opinion or some advice.

105
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:59,720
However, must can also be used to give advice.

106
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,620
For example:

107
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,790
You must try the fish.

108
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,810
It’s delicious!

109
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,050
Actually, you can also use have to to give
advice.

110
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,420
You could also say:

111
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,690
You have to try the fish.

112
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,090
It’s delicious!

113
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,990
Can you tell the difference between using
should to give advice, and using must or have

114
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,490
to?

115
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,370
Giving advice with must or have to is stronger
and more emphatic than giving advice with

116
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,050
should.

117
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,430
If you say:

118
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,000
You should try the fish.

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,720
This sounds quite neutral, but if you say:

120
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,050
You must try the fish!

121
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,130
Or, You have to try the fish!

122
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,130
These sound much stronger.

123
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,970
You’re more excited about what you’re
saying.

124
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,020
You really like that fish!

125
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:58,490
So, you can use must, have to or should to
give advice or express opinions.

126
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:04,820
Using must or have to expresses stronger feelings
than just using should.

127
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:11,730
However, if you want to give negative advice,
only shouldn’t is possible.

128
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,730
For example:

129
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:19,500
You shouldn’t eat so much chocolate at once—you’ll
make yourself sick!

130
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,419
You shouldn’t take the job unless you’re
sure it’s what you want.

131
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:32,849
In negative sentences, you can only use shouldn’t
to give advice or express your opinion.

132
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,620
You can’t use mustn’t or don’t have
to with this meaning.

133
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:44,800
At this point, you’ve seen how to use must,
have to and should to talk about obligations

134
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,920
or advice.

135
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:55,320
Let’s put everything together by comparing
all three verbs.

136
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,000
Use must for:

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,260
Obligations you feel strongly about: I must
remember to send him a birthday card.

138
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:13,120
Obligations in formal, written English: All
employees must wash hands.

139
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:20,600
Strong advice: You must read it—it’s an
amazing story!

140
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:28,140
Saying something is forbidden, if you use
mustn’t: Children must not be left unattended.

141
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:33,640
Remember that mustn’t or must not are more
formal, and in spoken English it’s more

142
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,860
common to say can’t.

143
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,210
Next, what about have to?

144
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,390
You use have to for:

145
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:50,130
Obligations which depend on rules or circumstances:
I have to wear glasses because I can’t see

146
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,430
so clearly.

147
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:58,830
Most obligations in spoken English: Do you
have to work tomorrow?

148
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:07,540
Saying something is not necessary: You don’t
have to do this if you don’t want to.

149
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,620
Strong advice: You have to try this ice cream!

150
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,750
Using have to for strong advice sounds more
conversational than using must.

151
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,330
Finally, should.

152
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,730
You can use should for:

153
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,790
Giving advice: You should try once more—I’m
sure you can get it.

154
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,990
Giving negative advice: You shouldn’t work
so hard.

155
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,230
Take a break sometimes!

156
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:41,630
Giving your opinion: If they make us work
overtime, they should pay us for it.

157
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:48,360
One last point: these three verbs can also
be used to talk about probability and certainty.

158
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,990
In this video, we focused on talking about
obligations and giving advice, but these verbs

159
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,320
can also be used in other ways.

160
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,780
So now you’ve seen how to use must, have
to and should in different ways.

161
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,390

164
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,290

165
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:13,970
