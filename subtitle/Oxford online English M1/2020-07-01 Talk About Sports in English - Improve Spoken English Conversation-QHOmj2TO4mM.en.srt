00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,210
Hi, I’m Liam.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,470
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,860
In this lesson, you can learn how to talk
about sport in English.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,580
Are you a sport fan?

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,860
What sports do you like playing?

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:21,520
Sport is a common topic in English conversation,
so whether you like sport or not, it’s good

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,200
to have something to say and be able to ask
some questions about sport.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:33,040
Before we start, a question: do you find it
difficult to listen to English for long periods?

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,460
No problem – use the English subtitles to
help yourself understand!

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,380
Turn them on now; just click the ‘CC’
button in the bottom right of your video player.

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:48,730
On a smartphone, tap the settings button.

12
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,760
Do you like sport?

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,100
Yeah, I’ve always been really sporty.

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,820
I played basketball and tennis at school and
university, and recently I’ve got into cycling.

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,889
What about you?

16
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:02,899
I’m not that into sport, to be honest.

17
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:06,810
I’m not that athletic, and I find most sports
boring to watch.

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,990
I go to the gym occasionally.

19
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,700
It’s hard to motivate yourself if you don’t
enjoy it.

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,520
Do you like watching sport, too?

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,799
Sometimes, though I’m not a fanatic.

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,340
Football or tennis can be fun to watch, I
think, but it’s not a big part of my life.

23
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,000
I like watching tennis, too!

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,689
It’s one of the only sports I’ll make
an effort to see.

25
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,060
Do you like sport?

26
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,990
Think about how you could answer.

27
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,640
You could say something like: ‘I’ve always
been really sporty.’

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,860
‘I enjoy watching sport sometimes, but
I’m not a fanatic.’

29
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,159
‘I’m not that into sport, to be honest.’

30
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,430
Do you know what the words ‘sporty’ and
‘fanatic’ mean?

31
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:02,900
‘Sporty’ describes someone who’s really
interested in sport, and who plays sport often.

32
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:08,880
A ‘fanatic’ literally means someone who
only cares about one thing.

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,260
You can use it with an indirect meaning to
describe someone who’s really interested

34
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,160
in something.

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,760
So if you say, ‘I enjoy some sports, though
I’m not a fanatic’, you mean that you

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,930
like sport, but it’s not the most important
thing for you.

37
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,370
Okay, you have three sentences.

38
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,730
Which is closest to your opinion?

39
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,629
These are good sentences to start talking,
but remember that you should always add more

40
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,740
detail if possible!

41
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,720
Let’s add some reasons or details to the
three sentences you saw: ‘I’ve always

42
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
been really sporty.

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:54,200
I played basketball and tennis at school and
university, and recently I’ve got into cycling.’

44
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,980
‘I enjoy some sports, though I’m not a
fanatic.

45
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,870
Playing football or something like that can
be fun, but I don’t want to take it too

46
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,800
seriously.’

47
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,640
‘I’m not that into sport, to be honest.

48
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:12,670
I’m not very athletic and I find watching
sport quite boring.’

49
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,900
These are already much better.

50
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,450
If you can add reasons or details when you
speak, your speaking will sound better, too!

51
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,800
Let’s look at some useful words here:

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:32,080
‘Athletic’ describes someone who’s in
good shape and who enjoys exercise and sport.

53
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,780
If you say ‘I’m not very athletic’ you
mean that you aren’t very good at sport,

54
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,079
and probably you don’t really enjoy it,
either.

55
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:48,200
Another very useful phrase is ‘I find…’,
as in ‘I find watching sport quite boring’.

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,430
This is a very good way to give your opinion
about something.

57
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,430
For example:

58
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,740
‘I find watching snooker weirdly fascinating.’

59
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,480
‘I find swimming very relaxing.’

60
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,060
‘I found volleyball much more difficult
to play than I was expecting.’

61
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,240
So, what about you?

62
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,989
Do you like sport?

63
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,910
Pause the video and make at least two sentences.

64
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,180
Remember to add reasons and details.

65
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,160
Okay?

66
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,880
Next, we’re going to look at how to talk
in more detail about different kinds of sport

67
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,140
that you do.

68
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,380
So, what are you up to this weekend?

69
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:37,190
We have a match on Saturday; no plans for
Sunday yet.

70
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,280
A match?

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,310
You mean you’re playing?

72
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,860
Yeah, have I not told you before?

73
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,180
I play 5-a-side football in a local league.

74
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,360
We play most Saturdays.

75
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
Where do you play?

76
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,639
Indoors, actually, in a sports hall.

77
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,000
That sounds fun.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,280
How did you get into that?

79
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,960
I do it with some old friends from university.

80
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,310
We played when we were students, and we’ve
kept it going since then.

81
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,090
Anyway, what about you?

82
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,090
Any plans?

83
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,919
I also have a big sporting weekend!

84
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:04,040
It’s the marathon.

85
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,950
You’re doing the marathon?!

86
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,199
Not exactly – I’m doing a half.

87
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,780
That’s what, 21 kilometres?

88
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,280
Yup.

89
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:13,419
I didn’t know you were so into running.

90
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:14,880
I wasn’t.

91
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,520
I used to go jogging once a week or so, just
around the park or whatever.

92
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,240
Then, I decided I needed a challenge, so on
impulse I signed up for the half marathon.

93
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,560
So, you must have been training a lot?

94
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Quite a lot, yes.

95
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,620
I’ve been running three or four times a
week for the last two months.

96
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,990
Are you confident?

97
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,630
Yeah, I think it’ll be fine.

98
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,229
I’ve done training runs that are around
20K, so I don’t think finishing will be

99
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:43,229
a problem.

100
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:50,990
Look at three sentences:
Which two did you hear in the dialogue?

101
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,650
You heard these two.

102
00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:00,220
Another question: here you have different
sports with the verbs ‘play’, ‘go’,

103
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,419
and ‘do’.

104
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:04,070
Can you think
of three more sports you can use with each

105
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,070
verb?

106
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,800
Pause the video and think about your answers!

107
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,020
You use ‘play’ with most ball sports.

108
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:19,340
That means you play tennis, play cricket,
play golf, play basketball, and play volleyball;

109
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:25,090
you can also play badminton, which is not
a ball sport.

110
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,400
Use ‘go’ with activities ending in -ing.

111
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,060
Most of these are individual sports; you can
go swimming, go cycling, go surfing, go climbing,

112
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,070
or go hiking.

113
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,050
You might be thinking: “what about ‘boxing’?”

114
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:48,730
Even though it ends with -ing, you say ‘do
boxing’ – it’s an exception.

115
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:53,490
Use ‘do’ with other activities, mostly
individual sports.

116
00:06:53,490 --> 00:07:01,340
You do yoga, do gymnastics, do judo, or do
Pilates.

117
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:06,870
There’s one more question you heard in the
dialogue: ‘how did you get into that?’

118
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,930
What does this mean?

119
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,470
This question is asking how or why you started
something.

120
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:20,080
Now, think about some questions: what sports
do you do?

121
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,580
How did you get into it?

122
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,220
Where and how often do you do them?

123
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,080
Think about how you could answer these questions.

124
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,260
Before you try, let’s look at three examples.

125
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,960
‘I really enjoy playing cricket.

126
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,760
I joined an online group and we meet in the
park once a week for a game.’

127
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,150
‘I started doing judo about a year ago.

128
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,379
I go to classes twice a week at a sport centre
near my office.

129
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:53,729
At first, I just wanted a new hobby, but I
really like it and I think I’ll start training

130
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:56,480
more regularly.’

131
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,180
‘I like playing basketball.

132
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,160
I’ve been playing since I was a kid, and
now I play for a local team.

133
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:07,430
We train three times a week and have matches
once or twice a week, sometimes in our town,

134
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,900
and sometimes in other cities.’

135
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,780
OK, now it’s your turn!

136
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,960
Think about a sport or physical activity you
do.

137
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,490
Try to make a few sentences talking about
it; say where you do it, how often, and how

138
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,770
you started.

139
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,419
Pause the video and do it now!

140
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:29,870
How was that?

141
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,840
Remember that you can always review a dialogue
or a section if you need to.

142
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,300
Let’s move on to our next point.

143
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,600
How was the game?

144
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Amazing!

145
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,950
We crushed them!

146
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,950
‘Crushed them’?

147
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,220
That sounds dramatic!

148
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,350
It was great.

149
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,880
There’s no better feeling than winning.

150
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Wow…

151
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,680
You’re so competitive.

152
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,170
Yes, true!

153
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,760
I love it.

154
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,250
Some people say that sport’s about taking
part, not winning, but I don’t agree.

155
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,300
That sounds a bit intense.

156
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,800
I play a lot of tennis and badminton, but
for me, it’s more about the social side.

157
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,710
Also, I just like the feeling of getting some
physical activity after sitting in an office

158
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,710
all day.

159
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,740
Fair enough.

160
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:20,110
Personally, I can’t motivate myself to do
any sport unless it’s competitive.

161
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,060
That’s why I mostly just do team sports.

162
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,760
I can’t go jogging, or go to the gym, or
anything like that.

163
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,210
I just don’t see the point.

164
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,750
I don’t know…

165
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,540
I think if it gets too competitive, then it
stops being fun.

166
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,630
Personally, I play sport to hang out with
my friends and relax.

167
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,790
It’s nice to win, but I don’t care that
much.

168
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,590
Why do people do sport?

169
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:48,150
How many different reasons can you think of?

170
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,530
Some people do sport to socialize.

171
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,130
Others love to compete.

172
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,760
For some people, sport is just a way to get
fit and stay healthy.

173
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,400
What about you?

174
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,030
Why do you do sport?

175
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:08,090
In the dialogue, you heard some possible answers
to this question.

176
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,890
You can see some useful language here for
giving your opinion about things.

177
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,870
You can use these phrases to give your opinion
about many different things.

178
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:25,220
For example: ‘There’s no better feeling
than when you’re tired after a good game.’

179
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:32,240
‘For me, the most important thing is just
spending time outdoors in the fresh air.’

180
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,660
‘I just like the feeling of pushing myself
to the limit.’

181
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:43,700
‘Personally, I’ve always loved being in
the water.’

182
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,420
What about you?

183
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:51,000
Can you describe why you do sport, and why
you like the sports you like?

184
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,220
Pause the video, and try to make two or three
sentences.

185
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,880
Use the language from this section if you
can.

186
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,660
Alright, so now you can say quite a lot about
sport.

187
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:09,310
Let’s put everything together.

188
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,860
To make a longer answer, you need to talk
about your general attitude towards sport,

189
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:20,810
talk about which sports you like, say where
and how often you do sport, and who you do

190
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,360
them with, and talk about why you do sport.

191
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,060
Here’s one example: ‘I enjoy some sports,
though I’m not a fanatic.

192
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,360
Playing football or something like that can
be fun, but I don’t want to take it too

193
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,860
seriously.

194
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,490
I play 5-a-side football with some friends
every Sunday.

195
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,100
We rent a sports hall and play a 60-minute
match.

196
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,420
For me, the most important thing is the social
side.

197
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,600
I don’t really care about the game, or who
wins.

198
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,940
I just like having a laugh with some good
friends and getting a beer afterwards.’

199
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,290
This example only uses language from the lesson.

200
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:08,180
You can see how you can build an interesting,
detailed answer using simple ideas.

201
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:14,120
Let’s do one more example, using original
language and ideas: ‘I don’t really like

202
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,880
sport that much, but fitness and staying healthy
are important to me.

203
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,070
That’s why I go swimming and do some weight
training regularly.

204
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,390
I mostly just exercise by myself at the sports
centre.

205
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,560
Personally, I just do it because I feel I
have to.

206
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,620
I don’t really enjoy it, although I don’t
mind it, either.

207
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,810
I do like feeling healthy and fit, but exercising
always feels more like work than something

208
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,660
fun.’

209
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,540
Okay, now it’s your turn.

210
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,110
Make a longer answer like the two you’ve
just seen.

211
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:55,120
Follow the same structure, and use the language
from the lesson if you can.

212
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,380
Don’t forget that you can write your answer
down if you want extra practice.

213
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,520
Also, it’s a good idea to practise your
answer several times, until it’s really

214
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,780
fluent and comfortable.

215
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:12,260
Then, if you’re really serious, don’t
just make one answer!

216
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,110
Make several answers, talking about different
sports.

217
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,680
Even better, make an answer from someone else’s
point of view.

218
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,300
If you practise like this, your English will
get better very fast!

219
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,930
Thanks for watching!

220
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,690
See you next time!
