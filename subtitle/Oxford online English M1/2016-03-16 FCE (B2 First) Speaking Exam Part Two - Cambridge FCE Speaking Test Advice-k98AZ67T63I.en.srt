1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,770
Hello.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:03,770
I'm Mia.

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,710
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:15,750
In this lesson, you can learn about how to
do the Cambridge FCE speaking exam part two.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,350
In this lesson, you can see what to expect
in part two of the speaking test and how to

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,750
improve your score.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,130
You'll see how the questions are structured,
and you can learn useful phrases that will

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:36,400
help you to compare photos and speculate on
what could be happening.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,570
We'll also look at sample questions and answers.

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:47,460
Part One: what to expect in part two of your
FCE Speaking Exam.

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,059
What happens in part two?

12
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:53,260
In part two, you'll be given two photographs.

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,660
You have to compare the two photographs and
answer a question about them.

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,610
You'll have about one minute for this.

15
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:08,689
Your partner will then be asked a short question
related to your photographs.

16
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:13,139
You need to manage your time carefully during
part two.

17
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:19,759
You only have around one minute to speak,
and you need to compare the photos and answer

18
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,619
the question.

19
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:26,840
There will be a prompt written underneath
the photos, to remind you of the question.

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,349
So you can look at this to help you remember.

21
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:38,350
Make sure you leave enough time to answer
the question after comparing the photos.

22
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:43,130
You don't need to speak to your partner in
this part of the exam.

23
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:50,390
However, after your partner has finished speaking,
you will be asked a short question that's

24
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,649
related to your partner's photos.

25
00:01:54,649 --> 00:02:02,099
It's important to listen carefully to what
your partner says when he or she is speaking,

26
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,569
because you don't want to repeat anything
they've said.

27
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:12,830
Listening may give you some good ideas on
how to respond to your question.

28
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,700
Part Two: how to compare photographs.

29
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:22,450
OK, now that you've seen what will happen
in this part of the exam, let's look at some

30
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,410
example photographs and how to compare them.

31
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,380
This will give you a good idea of what this
part of the test will look like.

32
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,640
Have a look at our first set of photographs.

33
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,130
They show people drinking.

34
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,990
It's a good idea to start your comparison
with a general statement about what is happening

35
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,530
in the first photograph.

36
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:52,870
For example, "In the first picture, I can
see a man sitting by himself in a cafe."

37
00:02:52,870 --> 00:03:00,540
Or, "Looking at the first photo, I can see
a man drinking coffee by himself in a cafe."

38
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,960
It is important to remember that you're not
describing the photos.

39
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,370
You're comparing them with each other.

40
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,990
After you've mentioned the first photo, you
need to directly compare that with the second

41
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,680
photo.

42
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,500
In this situation, you could say, "Whereas
in the second photo, I can see a group of

43
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,850
friends drinking in a restaurant," or, "But
in the second photo, there are friends drinking

44
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,000
together."

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,490
When you compare your photos, if you're not
sure what to compare, it's a good idea to

46
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,040
look at the obvious similarities between them
first.

47
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,550
For example, "In both pictures, we can see
people drinking."

48
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:55,010
Remember to use comparative adjectives and
adverbs when you compare the pictures.

49
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:02,850
For example, "The second photo shows a busier,
livelier environment than the first photo."

50
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:10,819
Some useful phrases and words you can use
to compare similarities are "in the same way,"

51
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,870
"similarly," "likewise," and "also."

52
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:20,989
For example, "The first photo shows a man
drinking coffee in an informal setting.

53
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:26,159
Similarly, the second photo was also taken
in a casual place."

54
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:32,849
Or, "In the first picture, we can see a man
relaxing and drinking coffee.

55
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:39,669
In the same way, the people in the second
picture also look very relaxed and happy."

56
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:44,800
It's important to remember, when you're comparing
photos, you're not just comparing the things

57
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,300
that are similar.

58
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,689
You should also look at the differences between
them.

59
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:58,039
Some useful expressions that compare and contrast
differences are "by contrast," "on the other

60
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:02,830
hand," "however," "whereas," and "while."

61
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,770
Look at the following examples.

62
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:10,659
"The man in the first picture is drinking
coffee, while the friends in the second picture

63
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:11,860
are drinking wine."

64
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,379
"The man in the first photo is sitting by
himself.

65
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:22,529
However, the second photo shows a group of
friends sitting together."

66
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:28,340
You could also say, "In the second picture,
I can see a group of friends enjoying the

67
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,340
company.

68
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,909
By contrast, the man in the first picture
seems happy on his own."

69
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:39,249
Many candidates focus too much on describing
the photos.

70
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:41,290
This is a mistake.

71
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,830
Focus on comparing the photos from the beginning
of your answer.

72
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:51,060
Use some of the key words and phrases we've
studied in this section.

73
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,669
This will make your answer more focused and
detailed, which will help you achieve a higher

74
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:59,669
score in your exam.

75
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:04,020
Part Three: what can I say about the photos?

76
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,120
So now you've compared the photos.

77
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,169
You might be thinking, "OK, what do I do next?

78
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,020
What else can I possibly say about these photos?"

79
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,509
The next step is easy.

80
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:22,210
After you've compared the photos, it's a good
idea to speculate about them.

81
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:28,430
This means saying what you think is happening
in the photos and why you think this.

82
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,240
Look at this example photo.

83
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,240
What could you say about this photo?

84
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,370
You could say, "The boy looks like he's enjoying
himself," or, "It seems like he's having a

85
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:46,850
good time," or, "He could be going to meet
some of his friends."

86
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:54,180
These phrases, "looks like," "seems like,"
and "appears," are very useful when you want

87
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,740
to talk about what could be happening in a
photo.

88
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,650
You can also use modal verbs, like "could"
or "might," to speculate.

89
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,879
Using this language shows the examiner that
you can speculate about something.

90
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:17,460
However, you can make your answer even stronger
by adding reasons why you think this.

91
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,099
Look at the examples again.

92
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:26,770
"The boy looks like he's enjoying himself
because he's outside with a football, and

93
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:33,180
it seems like he's having a good time, as
he's doing something fun on a beautiful day,

94
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,979
and he could be going to meet some of his
friends because you can't play football by

95
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,159
yourself."

96
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:45,900
These sentences are even better, as you've
shown the examiner that you can speculate

97
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,349
and also give your reasons behind your ideas.

98
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:55,830
This will help you give longer, more interesting
answers.

99
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,630
When you'd like to talk about what you think
could be happening in the photos, but you're

100
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:10,430
not 100% sure, you can use a phrase like,
"I guess," "I imagine," "I suppose," "perhaps,"

101
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,819
or "possibly."

102
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:19,319
For example, "I suppose it's a warm day, as
the boy is wearing a T-shirt," or, "I imagine

103
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,930
it's the summer holidays, because there's
a blue sky, and the boy isn't at school."

104
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,439
You could be wrong.

105
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:32,500
It might not be the summer holidays or a warm
day, but by using these phrases, whether you're

106
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,750
right or wrong doesn't matter.

107
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,180
You're only speculating.

108
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,039
There's no right or wrong answer.

109
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,190
It only matters that your answer is clear
and coherent.

110
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,030
Part Four: what makes a good answer.

111
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:55,250
By now, you should have a good idea of what
you can expect in the exam and how to talk

112
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,010
about the photographs you'll see.

113
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:04,140
Now we're going to look at some sample questions
and answers to review what you've seen so

114
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,140
far.

115
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,700
Please, remember that your answers need to
be around one minute long.

116
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,650
My sample answers are much shorter than this
because they're not complete answers.

117
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:19,190
OK, have a look at these photographs.

118
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,570
The examiner says, "Here are your photographs.

119
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,990
They show people painting.

120
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:31,480
I'd like you to compare the two photographs
and say which painting you like the most and

121
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
why.

122
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,050
All right?"

123
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,150
Now look at this answer.

124
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,390
"In the first photo, I can see a man painting
a picture.

125
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,560
He's a professional artist.

126
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,530
The painting is very big and has different
colors in it.

127
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,260
He's a very good artist.

128
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,450
The picture is beautiful."

129
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:54,490
This is an OK answer, but there's a problem.

130
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,880
Can you see the problem?

131
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,090
It's only describing one picture instead of
comparing them both.

132
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,260
Remember, this is a very common mistake.

133
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,620
Here's another example.

134
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,330
"In the first photo, I can see a man painting
a picture.

135
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,800
He's a professional artist, whereas the man
in the second photo isn't.

136
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,660
He's painting for a hobby or because he likes
it."

137
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,570
This is a better answer.

138
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:28,580
It's comparing both photos instead of describing,
and you can see here how the conjunctions,

139
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,130
"whereas" and "or," make the answer longer
and more fluent.

140
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:39,180
However, this answer still isn't showing speculation
about the photos.

141
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,820
How do you know the first man is a professional
artist?

142
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,950
How do you know the second man is painting
just as a hobby?

143
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,130
So how should it be done?

144
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,520
Let's look at this answer.

145
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:56,200
"It looks like the man in the first picture
is a professional artist because he's standing

146
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,910
in a studio, whereas the man in the second
photo is painting outside.

147
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:07,640
It seems like he's painting as a hobby because
I can see that his picture is more basic than

148
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,690
the first one."

149
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,530
This is much better.

150
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:18,110
You can see here how using expressions, like
"looks like" and "seems like," show that you're

151
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,440
speculating about the photos, as well as comparing
them.

152
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,760
This would get you a higher score in your
FCE speaking exam.

153
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,610
It's also very important to remember to answer
the question within your minute.

154
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:38,240
The question is always related to the photos
you're shown.

155
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,680
It's a good idea to link your answer to your
comparison.

156
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,140
Here's an example.

157
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:50,570
"It seems like he's painting as a hobby, as
I can see that his picture is more basic than

158
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,140
the first one.

159
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,950
However, I like this painting the most because
it's simple and bright.

160
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,930
It's a happy painting."

161
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:05,760
This answers the question very simply, but
still manages to answer the full question.

162
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,570
However, if you have a little more time, it's
a good idea to add more detail to your answer,

163
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,580
to make it even better.

164
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,950
Have a look at this answer.

165
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:22,920
"I like the second painting the most, because
although it's more simple, it's very bright

166
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,070
and colorful.

167
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:29,940
I like that he probably painted it while he
was relaxing outside, in contrast to the man

168
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,380
in the first photo, who I think paints for
his job.

169
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:39,640
In my opinion, it's a happier painting, and
I would enjoy seeing this kind of painting

170
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,130
on my wall."

171
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:47,570
You can see here how adding more adjectives
and opinions makes your answer more complex

172
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,790
and interesting.

173
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:56,230
This answer also links back to the points
you made when comparing the photos.

174
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,050
This helps to make your answer more coherent
and clear.

175
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:06,670
Now that you've seen these example questions
and answers and learned how to compare and

176
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:13,450
speculate, you should have a good idea of
how to do well in Part Two of your Cambridge

177
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,570
Speaking Exam -- good luck!

178
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,940
That's the end of the lesson.

179
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,500
