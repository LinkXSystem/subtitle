00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,160
Hi, I’m Mikey and welcome to Oxford Online
English!

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:12,190
In this lesson, you can learn how to use the
English modal verbs may, might, can and

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,190
could.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,370
You’ll learn how to use these modal verbs
to talk about possibilities in English.

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:23,910
Modal verbs are powerful, because you can
use them to express many different ideas and

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,240
complex nuances of meaning.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,430
However, they’re also difficult to use well.

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,380
Each modal verb can be used in many different
ways!

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,470
You can use might, could or may to say that
something is possible in the present or in

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,200
the future.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,210
For example:

12
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,609
They could be brothers—they look so alike!

13
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:56,210
I think it’s possible that they’re
brothers.

14
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,420
Where are my keys?

15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,970
They might still be in the car.

16
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,190
I think it’s possible that your keys
are still in the car.

17
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,930
It’s raining here, but it may be sunny there.

18
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,880
I think it’s possible that it’s sunny
there.

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,909
These sentences are all about the present.

20
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,140
There’s no difference between could, might
and may here.

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,330
You can use any of these three modal verbs
in any of these sentences—it doesn’t matter.

22
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:36,119
Could and might are more common than may,
but you can choose which modal verb you use.

23
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:43,259
Be careful with may be—two words, and maybe—one
word.

24
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:55,850
May be (two words) is a modal verb plus the
verb be; maybe (one word) is an adverb.

25
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,909
They aren’t the same!

26
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:02,960
You can also talk possibilities in the future:

27
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,750
It could cost more than you expect.

28
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,179
I think it’s possible that it will cost
more than you expect.

29
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:15,260
You might miss the train unless you leave
now.

30
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,700
I think it’s possible that you’ll
miss the train if you don’t leave now.

31
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,079
I may be around five minutes late.

32
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:26,069
I think it’s possible that I’ll be
a little late.

33
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:31,470
It doesn’t matter if you’re talking about
the present or the future; you can use these

34
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,599
modal verbs in the same way.

35
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:39,870
People will understand if you’re talking
about the present or the future from the context.

36
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,080
For example:

37
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,499
She might be there already.

38
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:45,669
She might be there tomorrow.

39
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:51,639
Here, the first sentence is about the present,
and the second is about the future.

40
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,569
You can understand this from the meaning,
not from the modal verb.

41
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:02,629
You can also make negatives by adding not
after the modal verb.

42
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:07,231
Use negatives to say that you think it’s
possible that something is not true, or that

43
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:12,120
something will not happen, in the present
or the future.

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,909
In this case, you can only use may or might.

45
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:20,739
You can’t use could to talk about negative
possibilities.

46
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:22,129
For example:

47
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:23,889
They might not be ready.

48
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:26,930
I think it’s possible that they aren’t
ready.

49
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:33,379
This could be in the present or in the future—you
can’t tell just from this sentence.

50
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,239
He may not be able to help you.

51
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,510
I think it’s possible that he won’t
be able to help you.

52
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,879
There’s no difference between using may
or might here, but remember that there’s

53
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,260
no way to use could in these sentences.

54
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,760
What about can?

55
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,020
We haven’t mentioned can until now, because
can behaves differently.

56
00:03:56,029 --> 00:04:00,480
Let’s see how!

57
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,010
Look at an example that you just saw:

58
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,439
She might be there tomorrow.

59
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,849
This is a specific possibility.

60
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:13,059
You’re talking about one person, one place
and one time.

61
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:18,359
Let’s add some more details to make it easier
to see this:

62
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,400
Sarah might be at the party tomorrow.

63
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,080
You can use might, may or could to express
specific possibilities.

64
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,039
You use can to express general possibilities.

65
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,810
You’ve seen what a specific possibility
is.

66
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,970
What does ‘general possibility’ mean?

67
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,270
Can you explain it?

68
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:46,050
A general possibility is something which is
true for many people, in many places, at many

69
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,389
times.

70
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:48,830
For example:

71
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,830
It can take two hours to get to the airport
if the traffic’s bad.

72
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,110
This possibility doesn’t apply to one person
at one time.

73
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,000
It applies to anyone who tries to get to the
airport when the traffic’s bad.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,180
Let’s look at some more examples:

75
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,840
It can be very wet and cold in spring here.

76
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,599
This is possible every year, not just
in one year.

77
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:18,879
He can be very difficult to deal with when
he’s in a bad mood.

78
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,620
This is possible every time he’s in
a bad mood, not just one time.

79
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,629
Moving countries can be a stressful experience.

80
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:32,830
It’s possible that moving countries
is stressful whoever you are, wherever you

81
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,930
move to and whenever you do it!

82
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,680
If you’re talking about general possibilities,
you can only use can.

83
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,150
You can’t use could, might or may.

84
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,199
General possibilities refer to both the present
and the future together.

85
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,229
For example, if you say:

86
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,909
It can be very wet and cold in spring here.

87
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:05,030
You mean that this is possible this year,
in the present, and next year, in the future,

88
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,340
and the year after that, and so on.

89
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:15,110
Also, general possibilities are only positive;
there’s no such thing as a negative general

90
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,110
possibility.

91
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,110
Let’s practise!

92
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,599
Look at four sentences.

93
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:25,449
For each one, decide if it expresses a general
possibility or a specific possibility.

94
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,350
Which modal verbs could you use in each case?

95
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,720
Pause the video and think about your answers.

96
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,920
If it’s difficult, review this part and
the previous part of the video.

97
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,020
Ready?

98
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,960
Let’s look at the answers.

99
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,490
In the first sentence, the word tomorrow makes
it specific.

100
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,150
Tomorrow is one day.

101
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:56,770
That means you can use could, might or may
in this sentence.

102
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:02,009
In the second sentence, in July in the south
is a general idea.

103
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:07,620
You’re talking about one place, but you’re
also talking about every year.

104
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,039
So, you should use can.

105
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,020
In the third sentence, you’re talking about
a general tendency which she has.

106
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,770
She can get angry any time when people don’t
listen to her, not just one time.

107
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,419
So, you need to use can.

108
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:29,650
The fourth sentence is talking about one reaction
to one thing.

109
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:35,639
The words when she finds out refer to one
piece of news, which she will find out at

110
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,819
a specific time in the future.

111
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:43,060
So, you need to use could, might or may.

112
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:49,240
Now, you’ve seen how to use might, may,
could and can to talk about possibility in

113
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,860
the present or the future.

114
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,040
But what about the past?

115
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,610
Let’s start with some examples.

116
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:06,319
Look at three sentences, and try to work out
how to talk about possibilities in the past:

117
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,100
Where is he?

118
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,800
I guess he might have missed the train.

119
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,939
I don’t know where the tickets are.

120
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:18,809
I may have left them in the hotel.

121
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:21,470
What was that noise?

122
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,599
I suppose it could have been the wind.

123
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:33,880
To talk about possibilities in the past, use
could, might or may, plus have, plus a past

124
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
participle.

125
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,149
Again, it doesn’t matter if you use could,
may or might here.

126
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:41,690
There’s no difference in meaning.

127
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,250
You can’t use can in these sentences.

128
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:50,580
There’s no way to use can to express possibility
in the past.

129
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,529
What do these sentences mean?

130
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:55,740
Can you explain what they’re saying in other
words?

131
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,329
The first sentence means that you think it’s
possible that he missed the train.

132
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:07,570
You’re waiting for him; you don’t know
where he is or why he’s late.

133
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,380
In the second sentence, you’re saying that
it’s possible that the tickets are in the

134
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,380
hotel.

135
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,810
You don’t know where the tickets are.

136
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,780
In the third sentence, you heard a noise and
you aren’t sure what it was.

137
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,370
You’re saying that it’s possible that
it was the wind.

138
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,460
You can also talk about negative possibilities
in the past, like this:

139
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,649
He might not have heard you.

140
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,360
It’s possible that he didn’t hear
you.

141
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,050
Their plane may not have arrived yet.

142
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,530
It’s possible that their plane hasn’t
arrived yet.

143
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:49,490
As before, you can only use may or might to
talk about negative possibilities.

144
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,959
You can’t use could in these sentences.

145
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,589
There’s another way in which could behaves
differently.

146
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:01,500
Let’s look.

147
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:07,080
In all the examples you saw in the last section,
positive and negative, you’re talking about

148
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:11,370
situations where you don’t know what happened
in the past.

149
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,540
For example, if you say their plane may not
have arrived yet, you don’t know if their

150
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,420
plane has arrived or not.

151
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,029
You aren’t sure.

152
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:22,250
What about this sentence?

153
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,370
You could have hurt yourself!

154
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,070
Be more careful next time!

155
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,720
This example is different.

156
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,310
Can you see how?

157
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:37,370
If you don’t know, here’s a clue: in this
sentence, do you know what happened, or not?

158
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:42,080
Did the person you’re talking to hurt themselves,
or not?

159
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,810
In this sentence, you know what happened:
the person didn’t hurt themselves.

160
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:52,209
You’re saying that getting hurt was a possibility,
but luckily it didn’t happen!

161
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:56,600
So, there are two kinds of possibility in
the past:

162
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,290
One: you don’t know what happened, and you’re
making a guess.

163
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,630
Two: you know what happened, and you’re
talking about a possibility which didn’t

164
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,630
occur.

165
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:11,470
In the first case, you can use any of the
three verbs: may, might or could.

166
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,730
In the second case, you can only use could.

167
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,900
You often need this when you’re talking
about something bad which didn’t happen.

168
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,430
Let’s see some more examples of this second
case:

169
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:26,740
They were very unlucky—they could easily
have won.

170
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:33,710
They didn’t win, but it was close, so
winning was a possibility.

171
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,899
She could have lost all of her money when
the company went under.

172
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:43,170
She didn’t lose all of her money, but
it was a possibility.

173
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,510
Of course, being in an accident was scary,
but it could have been much worse.

174
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:52,970
The accident wasn’t serious, but worse
results were a possibility.

175
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,020
In all of these sentences, you know what happened
in the past, and you’re talking about a

176
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,980
past possibility which didn’t actually happen.

177
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:07,089
Now, you’ve seen how to use the modal verbs
might, may, can and could to talk about possibilities

178
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:08,089
in English.

179
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:13,920
Let’s put everything you’ve learned together

180
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,680
Might, could or may can be used to talk about
specific possibilities in the present or the

181
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:20,699
future:

182
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,850
Take a jumper—it might be cold outside.

183
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,920
It could be a good game tomorrow.

184
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,170
You can use can to talk about general possibilities:

185
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,240
Using a credit card can be an expensive way
to buy things.

186
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:44,069
You can use could, may or might, plus have,
plus a past participle, to talk about possibilities

187
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:45,460
in the past:

188
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,959
They may have got lost.

189
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,170
I’ll call them and find out where they are.

190
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,750
You can use may or might to talk about negative
possibilities, meaning that there’s a possibility

191
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,889
that something won’t happen or didn’t
happen:

192
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:01,260
It might work, but it might not.

193
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,330
He may not have seen the message yet.

194
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:10,389
Finally, you can use could to talk about two
kinds of possibility in the past: situations

195
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:15,269
where you know what happened, and situations
where you don’t know what happened:

196
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:16,560
You could have missed the plane!

197
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,079
Don’t be late next time.

198
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,699
I’m not sure why he isn’t here.

199
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:24,300
I guess he could have missed the plane.

200
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,380
