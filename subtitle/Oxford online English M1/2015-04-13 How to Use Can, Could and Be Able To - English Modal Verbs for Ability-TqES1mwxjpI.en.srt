00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:02,870
Hello, I'm Oli.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,120
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,380
In this lesson, you can learn about using
modal verbs to express ability.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,710
If you don't know what modal verbs are, or
why you should care about them, watch this

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,640
lesson, which gives you an introduction to
the topic.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,149
So in this lesson, we're going to focus on
using the verbs 'can' and 'could' to talk

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,130
about ability.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,429
You will also learn about the verbs 'be able
to' and 'managed to'.

9
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:36,690
These verbs are not modal verbs, but we can't
use 'can' or 'could' in every situation to

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:43,940
talk about ability, so we sometimes need to
use a different, non-modal verb.

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,160
First of all, let's look at using 'can' and
'could' to talk about ability.

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,109
You can use 'can' to talk about abilities
in the present or the future.

13
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:57,450
For example: "She can speak Spanish very well."

14
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,710
Or: "Can you come with us on Saturday?"

15
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,229
You can also use 'could' to talk about general
abilities in the past.

16
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,790
For example: "I could run much faster when
I was younger."

17
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,930
'When I was younger' is a general ability,
so I could run faster any time I wanted.

18
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,500
"She could play the violin when she was a
child."

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,780
Again, this is a general ability about a longer
period in the past.

20
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,810
This is quite simple, and I'm sure you're
familiar with it.

21
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:38,030
However, there are many situations where you
can't use 'can' or 'could' to talk about ability,

22
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,950
and we need to use a different verb.

23
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,000
One of these verbs is 'be able to'.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,869
Generally, 'can' and 'be able to' have the
same meaning.

25
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:54,140
So, you can usually use either verb without
any difference in meaning: "She can speak

26
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,590
Spanish very well," or: "She's able to speak
Spanish very well."

27
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,890
These two sentences have the same meaning.

28
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:09,460
"I could run much faster when I was younger,"
or: "I was able to run much faster when I

29
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,540
was younger."

30
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,670
Again, there's no difference in meaning between
these two sentences.

31
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,610
However, you can't use 'can' or 'could' in
every verb tense.

32
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:25,660
If you want to use, for example, the present
perfect form, there's no form of 'can' or

33
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,000
'could' which you can use.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,220
So in these cases, you need to use a form
of 'be able to'.

35
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,550
For example: "He's been able to swim since
he was two years old."

36
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,080
There's no way to use 'can' or 'could' in
this sentence and keep the same meaning.

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,440
We have to use 'be able to'.

38
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,160
"I like being able to choose my own working
hours."

39
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,890
After the verb 'like', we need a verb with
'-ing', so we need to use 'be able to'.

40
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,980
Again, there's no way to use 'can' or 'could'
in this sentence.

41
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,100
There are many cases like this.

42
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,540
Generally, if you have a choice, it's better
to use 'can' or 'could', because it makes

43
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,620
your sentence simpler and shorter.

44
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,071
We sometimes choose to use 'be able to', even
when 'can' or 'could' are possible, because

45
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,100
it sounds more formal.

46
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:25,170
OK, now let's look at ability in the past:
'could' vs. 'be able to'.

47
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,410
This gets a little bit more complicated.

48
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:36,050
Let's look at an example sentence: "The traffic
was really bad, but we could catch our train."

49
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,050
Does it sound right to you?

50
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,090
What do you think?

51
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,070
If you said it sounds wrong, you're actually
correct; this sentence is not right, it's

52
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,630
not possible.

53
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,850
Do you know why?

54
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:55,470
The answer is this sentence is talking about
a specific ability at a specific moment in

55
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,070
the past.

56
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:04,010
In this case, you can't use 'could'; you need
to use a different verb.

57
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:09,460
You could say: "The traffic was really bad,
but we were able to catch our train."

58
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:15,650
Or: "The traffic was really bad, but we managed
to catch our train."

59
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,879
In both of these sentences, we're talking
about one moment, one train.

60
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:30,650
It's a specific situation; that means we can't
use 'could'; we must use 'be able to' or 'managed

61
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,449
to'.

62
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:34,069
Let's look at some more examples.

63
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:39,539
"It was hard work, but we managed to finish
everything on time."

64
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:44,120
That means we finished something specific,
at a specific moment.

65
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,949
"Our car broke down on the way, but luckily
I was able to fix it."

66
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:55,389
I fixed it at a specific moment; it wasn't
a general thing.

67
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:00,900
There's one more important point here, which
makes it even a little bit more complicated.

68
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:08,419
This difference between general and specific
situations only applies to positive sentences.

69
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:13,949
If your sentence is negative, there's no difference
between 'could' and 'be able to'.

70
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:19,889
It's like most other cases: you can choose
which verb to use and it doesn't matter.

71
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:24,669
"It was hard work, and we couldn't finish
everything on time."

72
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:31,190
Or: "It was hard work, and we weren't able
to finish everything on time."

73
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:37,210
Because these sentences are negative, it doesn't
matter if the situation is general or specific;

74
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,889
it's now possible to use both forms: 'couldn't'
or 'weren't able to'.

75
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:45,539
Again, there's no difference in meaning in
this case.

76
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:53,270
So, to review, 'can/could' or 'be able to'
generally have the same meaning, unless you're

77
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:59,759
talking about a specific situation in the
past, and the sentence is positive.

78
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,090
If you're not sure about this, remember you
can always use 'be able to' in every case

79
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,379
and never be wrong.

80
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:12,949
Next, let's look at 'could' in more detail.

81
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:14,090
'Could' has two meanings.

82
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,639
Look at two sentences: "I couldn't help you
because I had too much to do."

83
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,509
"I couldn't help you even if I wanted to."

84
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,560
In these two sentences, the verb 'could' is
used in different ways.

85
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,930
Can you see the difference?

86
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,919
Here's a question to check your understanding:
how would you use 'be able to' in these two

87
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,529
sentences?

88
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:42,129
If you want to think about your answer, pause
the video and think about it.

89
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:48,620
In the first sentence, "I couldn't help you
because I had too much to do," the meaning

90
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,030
is past.

91
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:56,180
If we use 'be able to', we would say: "I wasn't
able to help you because I had too much to

92
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,900
do."

93
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:04,849
In the second sentence, 'could' has a hypothetical
or conditional meaning.

94
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:12,919
To use 'be able to', we would say, "I wouldn't
be able to help you even if I wanted to."

95
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:19,139
So 'could' can have two different meanings;
a past meaning and a hypothetical meaning.

96
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:25,699
You need to use the context of the sentence
or the situation to understand what 'could'

97
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:26,729
means.

98
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:31,180
For example: "Why couldn't he do it last week?"

99
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,509
The time marker 'last week' shows you that
this sentence is past, and that 'could' has

100
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:37,120
a past meaning.

101
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,340
"We could work together, if you wanted."

102
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:48,240
Again, the end of the sentence with 'if' shows
you that 'could' has a hypothetical meaning.

103
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,539
OK, let's review the important points from
this lesson.

104
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:58,849
You can use 'can' or 'could' to talk about
abilities in the past, present or future.

105
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:03,969
'Can/could' and 'be able to' usually have
the same meaning.

106
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:09,219
Sometimes you need to use 'be able to', for
example if you need to use a verb with '-ing',

107
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:15,370
or if you need to use the present perfect
tense, or some other tense where 'can/could'

108
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,749
don't exist.

109
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:24,060
In the past, 'could' and 'was/were able to'
are sometimes different.

110
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,999
If you are talking about a specific situation,
and the sentence is positive, you can only

111
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:34,080
use 'was/were able to', or 'managed to'.

112
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,580
Finally, 'could' can have two different meanings.

113
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:45,930
It can have a past meaning, the same as 'was/were
able to', or it can have a hypothetical meaning,

114
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,700
like 'would be able to'.

115
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,280
OK, that's the end of the lesson.

116
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,080
I hope it was useful for you.

117
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,960
If you want to see the full version of this
lesson, you can check it out on our website.

118
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,520
The full lesson includes a text, so you can
read and review everything.

119
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,300
There's also a quiz to help you practise the
topic and check that you've understood everything.

120
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,840
OK, that's all.

121
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,290
Thanks again for watching, and I'll see you
next time.

122
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:12,880
Bye bye!
