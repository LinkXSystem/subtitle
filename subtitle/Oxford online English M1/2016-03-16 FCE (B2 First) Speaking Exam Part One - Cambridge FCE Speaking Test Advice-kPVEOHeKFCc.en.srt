00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:03,870
Hello, I'm Mia.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,740
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:15,370
In this lesson, you can learn about how to
do the Cambridge FCE Speaking Exam Part One.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:22,699
Even if you have a good level of English,
the FCE Speaking Test can be challenging.

5
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:29,470
In this lesson, you can see what to expect
in part one of the Speaking Test and how to

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,050
improve your score.

7
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:38,570
You'll see what kind of questions you'll be
asked, how you can answer them well, and also

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:45,140
some useful advice on how to feel more confident
during your exam.

9
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:52,120
Part One: what to expect in part one of your
FCE Speaking Exam.

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,760
What happens in part one?

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,910
Part one is simple.

12
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,870
It lasts for about two to three minutes.

13
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,720
In this part of the exam, the examiner will
ask you questions about yourself.

14
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,270
For example, "Where are you from?"

15
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,540
Or, "Tell me something about your family."

16
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,030
You could also be asked questions about your
opinions.

17
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:23,540
For example, "Tell us about a film you really
like," or, "What's your favorite part of the

18
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,590
day?"

19
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:32,870
Different topics you could be asked about
include your hometown, country, work and study,

20
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:42,280
sports and leisure, family and friends, travel
and holidays, hobbies and entertainment.

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,920
You'll normally be asked two or three questions.

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:53,190
This part of the test is a question-and-answer
between the examiner and the candidates.

23
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:59,420
You won't talk to the other candidate during
this section, although it's really good to

24
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,340
listen to their answers too.

25
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,640
The examiner may ask you the same question
as your partner, with a simple, "And what

26
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:18,240
do you think," or, "How about you," instead
of repeating the whole question again.

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,760
If you are listening, you can avoid repeating
the same answer as your partner and will show

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,450
that you are following the conversation.

29
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:34,590
Part Two: How to improve your score in the
FCE Speaking Exam part one.

30
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,140
So what does the examiner look for?

31
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,650
In this part of the test, the examiners will
look at three things: grammar and vocabulary:

32
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:52,370
whether you can use more complex words, phrases,
and sentence structures, and whether your

33
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:59,860
language is accurate and clear, discourse
management: whether you can build longer answers

34
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:08,760
with connections between your ideas, pronunciation:
how clearly you speak, and whether your stress

35
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,890
and intonation are correct and natural.

36
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:19,660
Let's look at what you can do to improve your
marks in grammar and vocabulary and discourse

37
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,250
management.

38
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,849
First, let's look at grammar and vocabulary.

39
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:32,860
You need to use a variety of grammatical structures,
especially some more difficult structures,

40
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,239
to demonstrate your level.

41
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:43,330
Look at the following answers to the question:
"Where would you like to go on holiday in

42
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,300
the future?"

43
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,370
"I would like to go to Paris.

44
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,790
It's a romantic city, and I want to see it."

45
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,900
This is a good answer.

46
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:01,040
It uses the correct tenses and gives more
information.

47
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:08,720
Now look at this answer: "If I had the opportunity,
I would like to travel to Paris because it

48
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,080
is such a romantic city and looks really beautiful."

49
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,449
This answer is even better.

50
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:18,449
Why?

51
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:23,560
Because it uses the second conditional, "If
I had," as well as the words for emphasis,

52
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:31,830
"so" and "really," and also the conjunctions,
"because" and "and."

53
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,660
These features make the answer longer, more
complex, and better connected.

54
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,030
This will give you higher marks in the exam.

55
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,460
You also need to show that you have a wide
vocabulary.

56
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,910
Try to use different phrases and adjectives,
so that you don't repeat yourself.

57
00:04:52,910 --> 00:05:01,020
For example, learn some more advanced vocabulary
related to common topics in part one, such

58
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:08,460
as phrasal verbs, idioms, or adjectives that
you can easily use in a sentence.

59
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,460
Then try to use them in your speaking exam.

60
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,470
This will improve your marks and impress your
examiner.

61
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:23,250
Look at these example answers: "I went to
the cinema, but it was empty."

62
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,320
"I went to the cinema, but it was deserted."

63
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:33,680
The second sentence uses a less-common adjective
and immediately demonstrates that you have

64
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,370
a bigger vocabulary.

65
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,350
Next, let's look at discourse management.

66
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:45,759
Remember, that means building longer, coherent,
and fluent answers.

67
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,430
How can you improve your discourse management
score during part one?

68
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:58,169
Make sure you use conjunctions, like "and,"
"or," or "but."

69
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:05,440
Try to also use more complex linking words,
like "although," "however," or "on the other

70
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
hand."

71
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,160
These can help you connect and contrast your
opinions, for a higher mark.

72
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,680
Look at the following sentences: "I'm going
to meet my friend later today.

73
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,890
We're going to go to a shopping center."

74
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:26,449
"I'm going to meet my friend later today,
and we're going to go to a shopping center

75
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:28,430
because it might rain.

76
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:34,020
On the other hand, if the weather is nice,
we might go to the park instead."

77
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:41,530
The second sentence uses the simple conjunctions,
"and," "because," and "on the other hand,"

78
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,889
to connect the ideas.

79
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:47,030
This sounds more fluid and natural.

80
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:53,169
This will give you a higher mark in your discourse
management score, as you will sound more like

81
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:56,380
a native speaker.

82
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,289
Another important part of discourse management
is fluency.

83
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:05,110
It is important to avoid hesitations where
you can.

84
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:12,340
One way to do this is to use an expression
to give yourself more time while you think.

85
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,570
For example, "That's a good question."

86
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,240
"Well, let me think."

87
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
"Let me see."

88
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,389
This will make you sound more natural and
avoid hesitations.

89
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:29,440
Part Three: How you can appear more confident.

90
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,300
Naturally, you might feel nervous before your
FCE speaking test.

91
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,169
This is normal, but it can also affect your
performance.

92
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:46,300
So let's look at some ways that you can feel
and appear more confident in the exam.

93
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,569
If you're confident and positive, you'll make
a good impression on the examiner and also

94
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:57,759
find it easier to talk naturally and fluently.

95
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:05,000
Warming up: it's a good idea to warm up before
your speaking exam, so that you're more relaxed

96
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,919
when you begin.

97
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:13,039
A good way to do this is to speak to the other
people waiting with you, in English.

98
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:19,190
This way, you are already used to speaking
in English when you begin the exam and don't

99
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,440
have to suddenly change languages.

100
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,740
Smile: when you meet your examiner, smile.

101
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,550
Be friendly.

102
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:36,050
If you smile, you immediately appear happy
and confident, even if you're extremely nervous.

103
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:42,110
If you're positive and friendly with the examiner,
they will respond well to you, and this will

104
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,470
help you feel more comfortable around them.

105
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,689
Remember to smile naturally.

106
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:51,489
You don't want to scare anyone.

107
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:55,459
Body language:your body language can say a
lot.

108
00:08:55,459 --> 00:09:01,160
Remember to sit up straight and look at your
examiner when you're speaking to them.

109
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:07,379
Making eye contact makes you appear more confident
and in control.

110
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:13,589
It's also a good idea to turn to your partner
and listen when they speak.

111
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:19,370
These simple things will improve your marks
in the exam because you are showing that you

112
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:27,730
have good communication skills and are interested
in what people have to say.

113
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,779
Try to speak naturally.

114
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:37,569
This is really important, as when you're nervous,
you might try to speak too quickly, which

115
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:43,540
can lead to mistakes and also make it difficult
to understand.

116
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:49,320
Make sure you speak naturally and clearly,
to avoid this.

117
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,199
This will also help you get higher marks on
your pronunciation, as you'll be understood

118
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,589
more easily.

119
00:09:57,589 --> 00:09:59,610
Be yourself.

120
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,279
My most important tip is to be yourself in
the exam.

121
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,929
It's okay to make jokes or use humor or express
your opinions.

122
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:16,269
Showing your personality, instead of trying
to be some kind of FCE robot, lets you express

123
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:21,610
yourself well in English, and the examiner
will see this.

124
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:28,129
Remember that in part one of the FCE Speaking
Test, the examiner will ask you about familiar

125
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:32,769
topics, for example, your home or family.

126
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:39,389
This will help you to relax and be yourself,
from the beginning of the exam.

127
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,390
Part Four: sample questions and answers.

128
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:51,089
OK, now that you know what's going to happen
in part one of your FCE Speaking Exam and

129
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:58,399
how to be more confident, going in, let's
look at some sample questions and answers.

130
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,269
These will help you see what makes a good
answer and also review the tips and points

131
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:08,290
we looked at earlier on in this video.

132
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,679
Our first question: "Where do you live?"

133
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,989
It is very likely you will be asked this question
at the beginning of your exam.

134
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:21,819
Look at the following answers: "I live in
Spain."

135
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:25,350
"I live in a pretty town in the south of Spain."

136
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:33,560
The second answer is better, as it is longer
and includes more details and description.

137
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:40,649
Remember that it is important to answer in
full sentences in the speaking exam, as this

138
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:45,429
will improve your marks and discourse management.

139
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:52,529
Here's another sample question: "Tell us about
a TV show you've seen recently."

140
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:58,029
A lot of the questions you may be asked are
likely to be very open questions, similar

141
00:11:58,029 --> 00:11:59,269
to this one.

142
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:05,601
These open questions are great because they
give you a good opportunity to express your

143
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:11,480
opinions and use some of your phrasal verbs
and adjectives.

144
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,670
Look at this answer: "Yesterday, I watched
a show about animals.

145
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,819
It was funny."

146
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:25,699
This is OK, but it's quite basic for FCE level,
and there aren't any details.

147
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:27,350
Here's another answer.

148
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,819
"Recently, I've been watching 'Making a Murderer.'

149
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:34,139
I'm interested in crime and psychology.

150
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:37,519
So I enjoy this TV show a lot."

151
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:44,299
You can see here how using more advanced vocabulary
and grammar can make your answer more interesting

152
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:46,079
and detailed.

153
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,679
This answer would help you get a higher score
on your speaking exam.

154
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,630
Now look at this question: "Are you interested
in sport?"

155
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:03,239
Again, this is a very open question, which
is good, as it lets you personalize your answer.

156
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,610
Look at this answer.

157
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,509
"Yes, I'm interested in sport."

158
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:11,290
What do you think?

159
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,609
It's not a great answer.

160
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:18,369
It's quite short and doesn't give any additional
information.

161
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:19,970
What about this one?

162
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,489
"Yes, I'm interested in sport.

163
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:24,819
I really like basketball and swimming.

164
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:28,569
In fact, I swim every day."

165
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:33,239
You can see here how giving a longer answer
gives more information.

166
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:40,329
However, this answer doesn't flow very well
and is still quite basic.

167
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:42,660
So how should it be done?

168
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,239
"Well, yes, I'm interested in sport.

169
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:52,129
I really like basketball and swimming because
they're great exercise, and you can practice

170
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,129
them outside.

171
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:58,989
In fact, I love swimming so much that I swim
every day."

172
00:13:58,989 --> 00:14:05,169
You can see here how using conjunctions makes
the answer sound more natural and allows you

173
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:08,480
to build longer answers.

174
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,089
You can also see how saying something simple,
like, "Well," at the beginning of your answer

175
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:21,249
gives you more time to think and produce a
better answer.

176
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:27,499
Now that you've seen some example questions
and answers, I hope you have a good idea of

177
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:34,420
what to expect in part one of your FCE Speaking
Exam.

178
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,669
That's the end of the lesson.

179
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:37,819
Thanks very much for watching!

180
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:40,399
