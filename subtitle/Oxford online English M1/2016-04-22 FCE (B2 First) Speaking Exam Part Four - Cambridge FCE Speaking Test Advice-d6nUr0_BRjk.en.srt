00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,100
Hello, I'm Mia.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,750
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:12,470
In this lesson, you can learn about how to
do the Cambridge FCE Speaking Exam part four.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:18,550
We'll look at what to expect in this part
of the test, what the examiners want to see,

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,840
sample questions and answers and how to improve
your score.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,590
Part one: what to expect in part four of the
FCE Speaking Exam.

7
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,950
So what happens in part four of the speaking
test?

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:40,239
The examiner will ask you open questions related
to the topics you discussed in part three

9
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,350
of the exam.

10
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:47,050
For example, if in part three you talked about
clothes, a typical part four question could

11
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,079
be, "Do you think it matters how people dress?

12
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,079
Why?

13
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,649
Why not?" or, "Some people say spending a
lot of money on clothes is a waste.

14
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,190
What's your opinion?"

15
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,640
You and your partner discuss these questions
together and express your opinions.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,270
The conversation will be between you and your
partner although the examiner might take part

17
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,759
in the discussion if you're going off topic
or running out of ideas.

18
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,659
This is the final part of the speaking exam
and will last about four to five minutes.

19
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:24,420
Part two: how to answer open questions.

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,530
What are open questions?

21
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:32,030
Open questions are very general questions
that don't need a specific answer.

22
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,170
They're great because you can answer them
in many different ways and they also give

23
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,579
you a great opportunity to express your opinion.

24
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:48,630
Let's look at some examples: "Would you prefer
to go on holiday abroad or in your own country?"

25
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,749
"What TV programs do you never watch?"

26
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:57,850
"What are the advantages and disadvantages
of wearing casual clothes?"

27
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:03,429
So how do you answer this type of question?

28
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:08,570
It's a good idea to begin with a phrase or
expression that tells the examiner what you're

29
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,009
about to say is your opinion.

30
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,310
For example, "In my opinion..."

31
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,310
"Personally..."

32
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,620
"For me, I prefer..."

33
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,890
Next, state your opinion.

34
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,560
What do you believe?

35
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,750
Which do you prefer?

36
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,069
Remember to give reasons for your opinions
so that you give more interesting, complex

37
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:30,069
answers.

38
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:31,400
Look at the following example.

39
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,860
"For me, I prefer not to watch horror TV programs,
I just don't like them."

40
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,730
This sentence states an opinion, but is very
basic.

41
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,780
Have a look again, "For me I prefer not to
watch horror TV programs because I'm easily

42
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,780
frightened.

43
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,000
I hate seeing blood," much more interesting.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,769
Not only does the reason make the answer more
complex and entertaining, it also adds a wider

45
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:03,530
range of vocabulary and grammar with the adjective
"frightened" and the conjunctions "because"

46
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,930
and "and."

47
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,379
This will give you a higher score in your
speaking exam.

48
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:12,079
Next, involve your partner.

49
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:16,879
The examiners want to see communication between
you and your partner.

50
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,579
Remember that part of your score depends on
how you communicate with your partner.

51
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:28,030
Asking your partner questions can help you
to improve this part of your score.

52
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,780
You can ask your partner simple questions
like, "What do you think?" or, "Do you agree?"

53
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,530
And, it's a good idea to ask your partner
specific questions if you can think of them.

54
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:47,090
For example, "For me I prefer not to watch
horror TV programs because I'm easily frightened

55
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,670
and hate seeing blood.

56
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,170
Does this affect you or do you like watching
horror?"

57
00:03:53,170 --> 00:04:00,079
It's a good idea to build a short conversation
with your partner that relates to the question.

58
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,790
Take short turns and discuss your ideas.

59
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,240
Balance giving your own opinions and asking
your partner questions so that he or she can

60
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,000
speak and take part in the conversation.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,700
Your goal is to develop your ideas and build
on your original answer.

62
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,700
However, make sure you don't go off topic.

63
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,470
Your answer needs to stay relevant.

64
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,640
What do you do if you really can't think of
anything to say?

65
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,970
One useful strategy is to use your own experiences
or your friends' experiences for ideas.

66
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:39,000
If you haven't got interesting answer to use,
imagine what your friends might say and use

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,840
that in your answer.

68
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,610
You can also invent answers to make them more
interesting.

69
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,280
Remember that the exam is for your English,
not your ideas, so it doesn't matter if your

70
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,570
opinions are true or correct.

71
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,130
Part three: sample questions and answers.

72
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:01,010
Now that you know what to expect in this part
of the exam, let's have a look at some sample

73
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,060
questions and see what makes a good answer.

74
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:12,320
Have a look at this question, "How important
do you think it is to take regular holidays?"

75
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,320
Now look at this sample answer, "In my opinion,
regular holidays are very important because

76
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
you need to relax."

77
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,550
This answer isn't that good.

78
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,130
Remember, you need to build longer answers
with more information.

79
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,140
Have a look again.

80
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:34,500
"In my opinion, regular holidays are important
because they give you the opportunity to relax

81
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,240
and maybe to experience different cultures
if you go abroad."

82
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,630
This is much better.

83
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,940
It's a longer answer which gives the examiner
more information and shows that you can build

84
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,330
better sentences.

85
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,780
However, there's still a problem.

86
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,850
Can you see what the problem is?

87
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,970
There's no interaction with your partner.

88
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,330
So what can you do to change this?

89
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,410
Have another look.

90
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:06,000
"In my opinion, regular holidays are important
because they give you the opportunity to relax

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,150
and maybe to experience different cultures
if you go abroad.

92
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,260
What about you?

93
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,980
Do you think seeing different countries and
cultures is important?"

94
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,690
This is a very good answer.

95
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:23,440
You can see here how you can ask your partner
questions which relate to your own answer,

96
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,420
making longer, better sentences.

97
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,830
This would give you a high score in your interactive
communication.

98
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,330
Okay, let's have a look at another sample
question.

99
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:40,500
"What are the advantages and disadvantages
of wearing casual clothes?"

100
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:47,770
Have a look at this sample answer, "Personally,
I like wearing a T-shirt and jeans when I'm

101
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,770
relaxing.

102
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,940
If I want to do something special, casual
clothes don't look good.

103
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,700
I might wear a dress instead."

104
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,040
This answer is okay.

105
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,190
It gives information and supporting reasons.

106
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:04,870
However, it doesn't really flow and the level
of grammar and vocabulary is more basic.

107
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,740
Also, there's no interaction with the other
candidate.

108
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,680
So how can we make it better?

109
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,250
Have another look, "Personally it depends
on what I'm doing.

110
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,640
Casual clothes have the advantage of being
more comfortable if I'm relaxing.

111
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,180
But if I'm doing something more special, like
going out with my friends, they don't look

112
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,460
as stylish.

113
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,610
So I'd wear a pretty dress or something like
that instead.

114
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,640
What about you?"

115
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,160
This is a good answer.

116
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,860
You can see here how adding conjunctions like
"so," "but," and examples like "going out

117
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,940
with my friends" make your answer more fluid
and natural.

118
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,690
This would give you a higher score in both
your discourse management and grammar vocabulary

119
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,690
marks.

120
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,070
Part four: final review.

121
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:56,770
Okay, now that we've looked at what you can
expect in part four of your FCE Speaking Exam,

122
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:02,380
let's quickly review the FCE Speaking Exam
and key points to remember.

123
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,530
The FCE Speaking Exam has four parts and lasts
for about 14 minutes.

124
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,250
In parts one and two, you speak on your own,
answering questions about yourself, and then

125
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,250
comparing two photos.

126
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,920
You will complete parts three and four with
a partner where the examiners want to see

127
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,330
you having a natural conversation.

128
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:27,210
You'll be marked on your vocabulary and grammar,
so try to use more advanced sentence structure

129
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,810
such as conditionals or relative clauses,
and learn some complex adjectives, phrasal

130
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:36,060
verbs, or idioms you can easily remember and
use.

131
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,430
You will also be marked on your discourse
management.

132
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:46,149
Remember that this means building longer,
better sentences, so it's a good idea to use

133
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:51,750
conjunctions to connect your ideas and add
reasons for your beliefs.

134
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,810
Explain why you believe in your opinion.

135
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:00,959
Interactive communication means that examiners
will look at how well you can have a natural

136
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,830
conversation with your partner.

137
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:09,990
Remember to listen to what your partner says,
respond to what they say and ask questions.

138
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:15,589
The examiners will also give you marks on
your pronunciation and a general mark for

139
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:21,379
global achievement which is based on their
general impression of your exam.

140
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:23,699
Remember to speak clearly and loudly.

141
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:27,339
Give your own opinions, be friendly, and smile.

142
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:32,779
Above all, try to relax and enjoy yourself
as much as possible.

143
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:37,730
Of course exams could be stressful, but if
you relax, you'll speak more naturally and

144
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:43,450
have a better chance to show the examiners
how good your English really is.

145
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,879
I hope you now have a good idea of what to
expect in your Cambridge FCE Speaking Exam

146
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,740
and how to impress your examiners.

147
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,740
Good luck!

148
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,110
That's the end of the lesson.

149
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,230
Thanks very much for watching.

150
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,350
