00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,300

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,860
He’s well-built, with broad shoulders.

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,720
He’s very muscular.

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,200
‘Well-built’ means big, but big because
of muscle, not fat.

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,350
The opposite of well-built is ‘skinny’.

15
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,060
You can say ‘He’s very muscular’ or
‘He’s very muscly’.

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,960
They have the same meaning.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,160
There are other ways to say the same thing;
for example, ‘He looks strong.’

18
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,620
She’s in good shape.

19
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,320
She has an athletic physique.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,200
‘She’s in good shape’ has the same meaning
as ‘She’s fit.’

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,229
‘Fit’ describes someone who exercises
regularly and is very strong.

22
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:25,980
Conversationally, in British English, ‘fit’
means ‘attractive’.

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,320
It can be used for men and women.

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,409
The word ‘physique’ means the shape and
condition of your body.

25
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:40,270
‘Physique’ is most often used with positive
adjectives to describe someone who is strong,

26
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,450
or who has an attractive body.

27
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,891
For example, the collocations ‘muscular
physique’ and ‘strong physique’ are

28
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:49,869
common.

29
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:53,850
He’s skinny.

30
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,740
He has a slight build.

31
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,270
What’s the opposite of ‘fat’?

32
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,990
Actually, there are several words.

33
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,279
‘Thin’ is the basic word.

34
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:08,030
‘Slim’ is similar; it means ‘thin and
attractive’.

35
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,920
‘Skinny’ is a more negative word.

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,940
It suggests that someone is *too* thin.

37
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,560
If you say that someone is skinny, it means
you think they should eat more.

38
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,000
Your ‘build’ is the shape of your body:
whether you’re broad or thin, whether you’re

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,480
muscular or not, and so on.

40
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,740
You can use many different adjectives with
‘build’.

41
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:37,960
Common ones are ‘medium build’, ‘slim
build’, ‘proportionate build’ and ‘stocky

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,440
build’.

43
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,560
‘Stocky’ means big or wide, usually with
muscle rather than fat.

44
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,510
He’s overweight.

45
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,180
He has a gut.

46
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,420
‘Overweight’ is a more indirect word than
‘fat’, although neither is polite if you

47
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,470
are talking directly to someone.

48
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,230
A gut means a big stomach.

49
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,870
You might use it to describe someone who has
a lot of extra weight on their stomach.

50
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:14,580
You could also say ‘He has a big belly’,
which has the same meaning.

51
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,460
He has chiselled features, with high cheekbones.

52
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,800
He has very well-defined facial features.

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,240
This is a chisel.

54
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,400
It’s a tool which is used to carve stone,
for example to make a sculpture or statue.

55
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,410
‘Chiselled features’ means that someone’s
facial features are very attractive and clearly-defined,

56
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,880
like a statue.

57
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,870
It’s generally used for men’s faces.

58
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,740
‘Well-defined’ is similar, but can
be used for men or women.

59
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:56,250
If your facial features are well-defined,
then your cheekbones, jaw, chin and so on

60
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,870
have a clear shape.

61
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:06,590
This has a positive meaning, although it doesn’t
necessarily mean ‘attractive’.

62
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,040
He has crow’s feet.

63
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,730
He has faint wrinkles in his forehead.

64
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,880
As you get older, you’ll get lines or wrinkles
in your face.

65
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,340
Crow’s feet are the patterns of wrinkles
you get in the corner of your eyes.

66
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:30,680
Wrinkles can be ‘faint’ – light and
difficult to see – or ‘deep’.

67
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,990
She has dimples when she smiles.

68
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,540
She has freckles on her nose and cheeks.

69
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,940
‘Dimples’ here means small holes in your
cheeks which appear when you smile.

70
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,100
Not everyone has them.

71
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,460
Although it’s not common, you can use the
word ‘dimple’ to refer to similar holes

72
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,250
in other places.

73
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,820
For example, some people have a dimple on
their chin.

74
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,040
Freckles are common among people with very
light skin.

75
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,120
Going out into the sun can make your skin more
freckled.

76
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,710
She has a round face, with a high forehead.

77
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,290
She has a double chin.

78
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,870
You can use many adjectives to describe the
shape of someone’s face, such as: round,

79
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,620
thin, symmetrical, long, or square.

80
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:34,610
If someone is overweight, they might have
a double chin.

81
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,320
He has a goatee.

82
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,920
He’s going grey.

83
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:47,320
‘Goatee’ is a common word; it’s a beard
which covers your chin and upper lip only.

84
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,120
You can also have a full beard, which covers
your whole face and neck.

85
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,540
There are many words for different styles
of beard, but most of them are not commonly

86
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,090
used, except by beard experts.

87
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,010
If you say ‘he’s going grey’, ‘going’
means ‘becoming’.

88
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:12,610
You can use ‘go’ in this way for changes
in someone’s hair; for example ‘go grey’

89
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,810
or ‘go bald’.

90
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,870
You can also use it if someone’s face changes
colour.

91
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:25,699
For example ‘She went bright red’ or ‘He
went pale when he heard the news’.

92
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:28,889
He has curly black hair.

93
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,740
She has thick shoulder-length curly hair.

94
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,260
‘Curly’ describes hair with tight curls.

95
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,060
What’s the opposite?

96
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,270
The opposite is ‘straight hair’.

97
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,180
In the middle, you can have ‘wavy hair.’

98
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:54,320
For length, you can say hair is long, short,
medium length, or shoulder length.

99
00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:00,840
For very long hair, you might say something
like ‘Her hair reached down to her waist’.

100
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,139
He’s bald, with a thick beard.

101
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,960
She has long blonde hair.

102
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:14,210
‘Bald’ only refers to people who have
lost their hair, usually because of aging.

103
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:20,640
If someone shaves their hair off, you can
say ‘He has a shaved head’.

104
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:27,580
Hair can be thick or thin; you can use these
adjectives for hair on your head, or for facial

105
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,190
hair: beards and moustaches.

106
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,820
When talking about hair, be careful with adjective
order.

107
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,920
Adjectives like ‘long’, ‘short’, ‘thick’
or ‘thin’ go before the colour.

108
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:45,000
So, you can have ‘long brown hair’, ‘thick
dark hair’, ‘short fair hair’, and so

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,800
on.

110
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,729
He has fair hair.

111
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:56,120
His hair is shaved short at the back and sides,
and swept to one side on top.

112
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,520
‘Fair hair’ is similar to ‘blond hair’,
but is has a wider meaning.

113
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,389
‘Fair’ just means ‘light’, so it could
include light brown hair or dark blond hair.

114
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:11,760
‘Sweep’ generally means to clean your
floor with a broom.

115
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,810
However, you can also use it for hair, especially
when you push your hair in one direction.

116
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,800
You can sweep your hair to one side, sweep
your hair into a ponytail, or sweep your hair

117
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,820
back.

118
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,440
That’s all for this lesson.

119
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:27,870
Thanks for watching!

120
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,660
See you next time!
