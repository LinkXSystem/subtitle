00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,570
Rheedan: Hello my name is Rheedan.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,000
Vicki: Hello, I'm Vicki.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,510
Rheedan: Welcome to Oxford Online English.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,320
In this lesson you can learn about how to
shop for clothing.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,710
Vicki: Have you bought clothing in English
before?

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,300
Rheedan: If not, we hope to change that with
this lesson.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,410
And if you have, we want to make the next
time even easier.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,230
Vicki: Shopping for clothing will give you
a good opportunity to practice your English.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,070
Rheedan: We'll start by showing you a sample
dialogue.

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,090
Vicki: Then we'll learn a few phrases that
will help you when you go shopping.

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,440
Rheedan: Hello, can I help you?

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,120
Vicki: No, thanks.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,490
I'm just browsing.

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,170
Rheedan: Okay.

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,020
Let me know if you need any help.

16
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,900
Vicki: Actually do you have any dresses in
stock?

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,300
Rheedan: Yes.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,720
Let me show you.

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,920
Vicki: I like this one.

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,060
Do you have it in another color?

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:07,260
Rheedan: Yes, this dress also comes in red,
blue, black, and green.

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,790
Vicki: I'd like to try the blue one, please.

23
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,510
Rheedan: Sure, the changing rooms are over
there.

24
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,470
Vicki: Can I try this in a smaller size?

25
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,600
Rheedan: Sorry, we don't have any in stock
left in that color.

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,200
Would you like to try another color?

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,240
Vicki: I really like the blue one.

28
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,390
Rheedan: We have a special offer, buy one
get one free.

29
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,780
Vicki: Really?

30
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,860
That's a bargain.

31
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,490
Rheedan: Yes, we have a lot of special deals
on our clothing.

32
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,530
Vicki: In that case, I'll take the red one
and the black one.

33
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,909
Rheedan: Would you like anything else?

34
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,720
Vicki: No, thanks.

35
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,010
I'll just get this.

36
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,159
Can I pay by card?

37
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,130
Rheedan: Of course, please enter your pin.

38
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,520
Vicki: What is my pin number?

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,770
Oh, yes.

40
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,860
Rheedan: Please wait one moment.

41
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,860
Sign here.

42
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,260
Vicki: Can I get a receipt?

43
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,440
Rheedan: Of course, here you go.

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,950
Vicki: Thank you.

45
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,060
Have a nice day.

46
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,980
Rheedan: Thanks for shopping with us.

47
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,409
Now, let's look at some of the words you'll
need when going clothing shopping.

48
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:26,030
Vicki: When you first enter the clothing store,
the shop assistant might greet you and ask

49
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,090
if you need any help.

50
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,849
If you are just looking around, you can say
that you are browsing.

51
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:38,469
'Browsing' means looking at many things in
a shop to see if there is something you want

52
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:39,469
to buy.

53
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:46,129
Rheedan: If you're looking for something in
particular, you can ask, "Do you sell jeans?"

54
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:48,700
"Do you have jeans?"

55
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,129
"I'm looking for jeans."

56
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,689
"Do you have jeans in stock?"

57
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:59,659
If the shop has the clothing you're looking
for, you will want to try it on before you

58
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:00,659
buy it.

59
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:06,029
You can try on the clothing in the changing
room, a room for trying on clothing.

60
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:12,319
Vicki: After you've tried on the clothing,
you might want to change the size or colour.

61
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,189
You can ask, "Do you have this is another
size?"

62
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:20,640
"Do you have this in a size eight?"

63
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,730
"Do you have this is another colour?"

64
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,230
"Do you have this in green?"

65
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,659
You've tried on the clothing, it's the right
size and the right colour, now you want to

66
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:36,769
know how much it costs.

67
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:43,379
If you're buying one item, you can ask, "How
much is this?"

68
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:49,659
If you're buying more than one item, you can
ask, "How much are these?"

69
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:55,859
If the clothing costs a lot of money, you
can say, "That's really expensive."

70
00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:04,529
If the clothing isn't expensive, you can say,
"That's really cheap," or, "That's a bargain."

71
00:04:04,529 --> 00:04:12,980
If you choose to buy the clothing, you can
say, "I'll take them," or, "I'll take it."

72
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,780
Rheedan: Once you've finished shopping and
are getting ready to pay, the shop assistant

73
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,560
might ask you, "Will there be anything else?"

74
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,960
"Can I help with anything else?"

75
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,110
They will ask if you want to pay with cash
or by card.

76
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,830
Usually they'll just say, "Cash or card?"

77
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:41,490
Vicki: You can answer, "I'll pay by card,"
or, "I'll pay by cash."

78
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,930
Don't forget to get a receipt.

79
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,300
Say, "Could I have a receipt please?"

80
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,540
I hope these phrases help you the next time
you're shopping.

81
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,740
Rheedan: That's the end of the lesson.

82
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,160
