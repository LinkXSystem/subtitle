00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,530
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,660
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,740
In this lesson, you can learn how to answer
IELTS academic writing task one questions.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:15,410
In task one of the academic IELTS writing
exam, you have to summarise and describe the

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,570
information given to you in some kind of chart.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:27,119
You might have to summarise and describe a
pie chart, a line graph, a bar chart, a table,

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,820
a diagram, or even a map.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,500
Are you watching on YouTube?

9
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:35,899
If so, you can find a link to our website
in the video description.

10
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:41,660
The lesson page on our website includes the
task as well as a model answer.

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,350
We recommend watching the video on our website
so you can refer to the task and the model

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,370
answer while you watch.

13
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,530
One more thing: do you want to watch this
video with subtitles?

14
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,829
You can!

15
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:59,359
Just click the ‘CC’ button in the bottom
right of your video player.

16
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,400
In this lesson, you’ll see a sample IELTS
academic writing task 1 question.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,190
You can learn how to approach these questions
and write your own answer.

18
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,540
You’ll also see some useful tips to help
you improve your IELTS writing score.

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:24,140
Let’s start by looking at our sample question:
So, what should you do first?

20
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,910
With all IELTS writing, you need to organise
your ideas before you start.

21
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,840
For a chart such as this one, think about
how to connect the data.

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,360
Often, IELTS academic task one questions contain
lots of data.

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,060
Many students try to present every piece of
information, like a big list, but this is

24
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,940
a mistake.

25
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,020
Do you know why?

26
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,359
If you do this, your writing will probably
be too long and repetitive.

27
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:57,670
You also won’t have much progression in
your writing, which is needed for C&C scores

28
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,740
of six or higher.

29
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,630
So, you need to connect and group the data,
but how?

30
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,390
There’s no general rule here, but here’s
a good starting point: look for *similarities*

31
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,280
and *contrasts*.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,300
In this question, you should look for similarities
and contrasts both within each chart, and

33
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,610
between the two charts.

34
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,050
Think about it now.

35
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,770
Look at the charts, and try to find similarities
and contrasts in the data.

36
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:29,260
You can see the full-sized chart on the webpage
for this lesson.

37
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,860
Don’t forget: if you’re watching on YouTube,
there’s a link in the video description.

38
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,020
Pause the video, and do it now!

39
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,310
Ready?

40
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,050
Here are some ideas.

41
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,550
In the first chart, the proportions for ‘living
with flatmates’ and ‘living with parents’

42
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:53,700
are similar, and they’re much larger than
the other two segments, which are similar

43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,430
to each other.

44
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,700
In the second chart, the proportions for ‘living
with flatmates’ and ‘living alone’ are

45
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,220
similar.

46
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,320
‘Living with a partner or spouse’ is much
larger than all the other groups.

47
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,820
Between the two charts, the proportions for
‘living alone’ are very similar.

48
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:21,890
The other segments are all quite different,
especially ‘living with a partner or spouse’.

49
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:28,180
Did you get these ideas, or did you have different
ideas for similarities and contrasts?

50
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,300
There’s more than one way to do this.

51
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,540
But, you should think about this point before
you start writing.

52
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,220
Try to make connections in your head, and
put the data you’re given into groups.

53
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:45,680
This will help you to link the data when you
write, which is necessary for higher scores.

54
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,980
What else should you do before you start writing?

55
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:55,990
One: for a chart, check whether it shows figures,
or percentages, or a mix.

56
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,330
You need different language to talk about
these things.

57
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:06,810
If the chart shows figures, you’ll need
to talk about numbers, figures, amounts, and

58
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,810
so on.

59
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:14,470
If the chart shows percentages, you’ll need
to talk about percentages and proportions.

60
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:20,700
Here, these are pie charts, so you need to
talk about percentages and proportions.

61
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:28,300
Two: check if the data relates to the past,
the present, the future, or a combination.

62
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,639
Sometimes, we see IELTS students who don’t
pay attention to this, and then they mix different

63
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,639
verb tenses in their answer.

64
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,289
This could hurt your score.

65
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:46,490
Decide what verb tenses you need (past or present or future or mixed) and try
to keep it in your head as you write.

66
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,960
Here, the charts are from 2015, so you’ll
need past verb forms.

67
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,940
Three: ask yourself if the charts refer to
a moment in time, or changes over time.

68
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,000
You’ll need different language in each case.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,199
Here, the charts refer to a moment in time.

70
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,280
This means you’ll need to use the verb ‘be’
a lot.

71
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,820
You won’t use verbs like ‘increase’
or ‘change’, like you would in some IELTS

72
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,260
task one questions.

73
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,750
Make sure you organise your ideas clearly
*before* you start writing.

74
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,919
Time spent planning will increase your chances
of writing a well-structured, complete task.

75
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,219
Now, you’re ready to write.

76
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:33,919
How should you start?

77
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,740
At the start of your answer, you should do
two things.

78
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,920
One: write a short paragraph – one or two
sentences – saying what the chart shows.

79
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:49,080
Two: write another short paragraph with an
overview.

80
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,060
This doesn’t have to be a separate paragraph;
you can put it together with the first paragraph

81
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,060
if you want.

82
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,740
It doesn’t matter.

83
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,080
Let’s look at these one by one.

84
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,919
For the first paragraph, you just need to
restate the information in the instructions,

85
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:11,169
*but* you should use paraphrase or different
structures to avoid too much repetition.

86
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:19,279
Look at the example from our model answer:
Often, IELTS students have problems with this.

87
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,289
This is because they try to follow the sentence
structure in the task, and just change the

88
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:25,700
words.

89
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,600
Paraphrase is useful, but you need to use
other skills, too.

90
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,199
For example, you can use different references.

91
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:40,580
The task refers to ‘two charts’ while
our model answer refers to ‘pie charts’.

92
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,070
You can put ideas in a different order.

93
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:49,409
The task says ‘living arrangements of two
different age groups’, but in our model

94
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:55,789
answer, we switch the order of these ideas,
as well as changing the words.

95
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:58,509
Sometimes, paraphrase is enough.

96
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:01,599
The task mentions ‘a certain country’.

97
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:07,159
In our model answer, we paraphrase this to
‘an unspecified country’.

98
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:14,449
Finally, you can avoid repetition by using
different levels of generality or specificity.

99
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:20,759
The task refers to ‘living arrangements’;
in our model answer, we list the four specific

100
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,969
categories.

101
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:26,520
You don’t need to change *everything* from
the task.

102
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,259
It’s fine to copy and repeat small chunks
of language.

103
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:33,979
Also, there are some things you have to repeat.

104
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:40,320
Here, there’s no way to change ‘in 2015’,
so we kept it the same.

105
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,060
One final point: it’s fine to copy any text
which appears on the chart itself.

106
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:52,300
This means you can – and should – copy
the categories, like ‘living alone’, ‘living

107
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,569
with parents’ and so on.

108
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:57,740
That gives you your first paragraph.

109
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,279
Next, you need to write the overview.

110
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,520
You can also put your overview paragraph at
the end, if you want.

111
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,409
For your overview, think about this: imagine
you want to tell someone about the chart,

112
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:13,470
but you can only say one or two sentences.

113
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,340
How would you do it?

114
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:22,759
Hopefully, this question is easier, because
you planned your answer, and found connections

115
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:28,650
between different points, and looked
for contrasts and similarities.

116
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,680
You did that, didn’t you?

117
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,310
You can use that here!

118
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:38,750
Your goal in the overview is to take the most
important points from the chart, without going

119
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,020
into detail.

120
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,810
If you want to try, then pause the video and
write your own overview sentence.

121
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,490
We’ll show you our example in a few seconds.

122
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,490
Did you do it?

123
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:59,330
Here’s our model sentence:
Our model overview is two sentences.

124
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,850
An overview should be one or two sentences
long.

125
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:08,410
If your overview is longer, it’s probable
that you’re either including too much detail,

126
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:13,040
or separating ideas which should be combined
into one sentence.

127
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,900
Don’t mention any specific numbers or statistics
in the overview.

128
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,220
Include big-picture details only.

129
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,640
Here, you can see two ideas.

130
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,500
One was comparing the two charts, and highlighting
that the trends are different in each one.

131
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,740
The second idea highlights the most popular
living arrangement in each group.

132
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,020
Like many things here, there isn’t just
one way to write an overview.

133
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:46,220
However, someone who reads your overview should
have a general idea of what the charts will

134
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,220
show.

135
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:54,260
Now, let’s see some skills you need to write
the rest of your answer.

136
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:00,010
After your overview, you’ll write one or
more paragraphs, explaining the contents of

137
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,930
the charts in more detail.

138
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:08,890
In this and the next three sections, you’ll
see some common problems which IELTS students

139
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,180
have, and how you can avoid them.

140
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,440
First, it’s easy for IELTS task one answers
to become repetitive.

141
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,240
Look at a sentence:
Looks fine, right?

142
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Let’s add another one.

143
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,360
Hmm…

144
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,520
Not sure this is going well.

145
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,300
Let’s add one more.

146
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,330
Do you see the problem?

147
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:43,000
If you write like this, your writing becomes
repetitive, and starts to feel like a list.

148
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,930
Even if you change some words, like using
‘approximately’ instead of ‘about’,

149
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:54,640
or ‘proportion’ instead of ‘percentage’,
it won’t solve the problem.

150
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,820
So, what should you do?

151
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:04,260
There’s more than one idea here, but first,
you need to try to use varied sentence structures.

152
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,600
Look at the first sentence you saw before.

153
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,020
Here’s a challenge: how many ways can you
think of to say the same idea, without changing

154
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,920
the meaning, or losing any detail?

155
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,620
Pause the video, and try to write this idea
in at least three different ways.

156
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,970
Do it now!

157
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,970
Could you do it?

158
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,010
Here are some possibilities.

159
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:34,100
‘Around 20% of 25-34-year-olds lived alone.’

160
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:41,180
‘Among 25-34-year-olds, around 20% of people
lived alone.’

161
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:48,360
‘In the 25-34 age group, about 20% opted
to live alone.’

162
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:57,220
‘Approximately one fifth of those aged 25-34
lived by themselves.’

163
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,690
What about your ideas?

164
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,240
Were they similar to these, or different?

165
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,290
So, what’s going on here?

166
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:11,670
First, you can simply change the order of
the ideas, as in sentence one.

167
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:18,120
You can use an adverbial, like ‘among 25-34-year-olds’
in sentence two.

168
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,110
You can use different words to refer to the
same thing.

169
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:27,680
For example, instead of ’25-34-year-olds’,
sentence three refers to ‘the 25-34 age

170
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,660
group’.

171
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:35,580
Instead of ‘around 20 per cent’, sentence
four refers to ‘approximately one fifth’.

172
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:41,980
Sentences three and four also change the words
‘lived alone’, either by adding an idea

173
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:48,120
– ‘opted to live alone’ in sentence
three – or by paraphrasing – ‘lived

174
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,360
by themselves’ in sentence four.

175
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,560
Be careful with this, because when you change
the words, it’s easy to change the meaning.

176
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:03,100
Make sure that your words have the same meaning
as whatever you’re referring to.

177
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,310
Learning to vary your sentence structure is
vital if you want to get higher scores for

178
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,010
C&C and grammar.

179
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,110
However, there are other key skills you need.

180
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,610
Let’s look at another!

181
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,230
Look at two sentences.

182
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:25,100
These sentences are fine, *but* if you write
your whole answer like this, it will probably

183
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,500
get overlong and repetitive.

184
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:33,770
Also, to get higher grammar scores, you need
to use a range of complex sentence structures.

185
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:38,490
So, you should try to combine ideas where
you can.

186
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:44,860
For example:
You can also combine contrasting ideas, using

187
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,650
conjunctions like ‘while’, ‘whereas’,
‘although’ and so on.

188
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,760
Here’s a task for you.

189
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,140
Look at the two charts, and find two contrasting
data points.

190
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:03,150
Write *one* sentence describing them both,
linking the two ideas with a conjunction.

191
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:08,260
Pause the video and try it now!

192
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,330
Did you do it?

193
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,960
Let’s look at one example:

194
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:18,710
‘Among 35-44-year-olds, almost half lived
with their partner or spouse, while a much

195
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:24,860
smaller proportion lived with their parents
(around 10-15%).’

196
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,440
Of course, there are many possibilities here.

197
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,120
But, you should be thinking about this all
the way through your answer.

198
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,820
Look through the model answer.

199
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,180
Try to find where we’ve combined two or
more ideas in one sentence.

200
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,110
Take note of different ways to combine similar
or different ideas, and try to use them in

201
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,900
your writing.

202
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:53,060
Let’s move on and look at one more key skill.

203
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,340
Look at these three sentences.

204
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:03,380
‘The number of 35-44-year-olds living with
their parents was quite high – around 50.’

205
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:10,010
‘The percentage of 35-44-year-olds living
with flatmates decreased dramatically compared

206
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,300
to the younger age group.’

207
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:20,150
‘Just over a quarter of 35-44-year-olds
lived by themselves.’

208
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,550
What do you think?

209
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,820
Good sentences, or not?

210
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,350
All three sentences have problems.

211
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,350
Can you find them?

212
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,730
You’ll need to look at the charts, too.

213
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:36,160
Pause the video and think about it if you
want.

214
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,160
Any ideas?

215
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,830
Let’s look together.

216
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,100
All three sentences have issues with precision
of language.

217
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,700
We see these problems often in our students’
IELTS writing.

218
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,950
The first sentence refers to ‘number’
and ‘around 50’.

219
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,570
This is too loose.

220
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:58,030
First, the pie charts don’t give you *numbers*,
in the sense of quantities.

221
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:03,320
It’s a percentage, so you should use the
word ‘percentage’ or ‘proportion’.

222
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,060
Secondly, what does ‘50’
mean?

223
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,800
50 what?

224
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:13,430
If you mention a number, you should add the
units, in this case, ‘per cent’.

225
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,840
The second sentence has two problems.

226
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:22,200
First, it doesn’t make sense to say that
the percentage ‘decreased’.

227
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:28,280
‘Decrease’, ‘increase’ and similar
verbs are used when things change over time,

228
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,140
but these pie charts refer to one moment.

229
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:38,630
Secondly, ‘dramatically’ suggests a very
large difference or change, but in this case,

230
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:43,930
the difference between the two percentages
was not that great.

231
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:49,480
IELTS students often try to use words like
this to increase their vocabulary score.

232
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,340
However, it’s more important that your words
fit the data accurately.

233
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:03,820
Here’s a better version of sentence two:
What about the third sentence?

234
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,459
Very simple: the information is incorrect.

235
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:12,980
The pie chart shows that just *under* a quarter
of this age group lived alone.

236
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,569
When you’re under time pressure, it’s
easy to make mistakes like this.

237
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:22,350
However, mistakes with the data will limit
your TA score to six, so it’s important

238
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:26,500
to make sure you get every detail accurate.

239
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,340
Don’t forget to practise this further by
visiting the full version of this lesson on

240
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,509

241
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:35,300
You could also try writing your own answer
for this task.

242
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,370
Good luck if you have an IELTS exam coming
up soon!

243
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,299
Thanks for watching!

244
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:40,870
See you next time!
