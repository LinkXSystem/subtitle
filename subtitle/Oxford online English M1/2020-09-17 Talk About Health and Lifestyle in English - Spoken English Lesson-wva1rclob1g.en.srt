00:00:01,189 --> 00:00:03,560
Hi, I’m Stephanie.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,310
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,990
In this lesson, you can learn to talk about
lifestyle and health in English.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,820
Are you in good shape?

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,080
Do you have a balanced diet?

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,160
Is your work-life balance healthy?

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,580
You’ll learn how to discuss these and other
questions in this class.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:28,700
Before we start, you should take a look at
our website: Oxford Online English dot com.

Of course you can also take classes from one
of our teachers if you need more help with

13
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,260
your English.

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,700
Oxford Online English dot com.

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,420
What’s in this box?

16
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:57,899
It’s so heavy!

17
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,329
I ordered some kettlebells.

18
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:01,989
Kettlebells?

19
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:03,260
What for?

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,090
I’ve decided to start working out.

21
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,090
You?

22
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,020
I never imagined you being a fitness enthusiast.

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,740
I’m not, but I realised the other day that
I’m incredibly out of shape.

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,760
I was running to catch the bus, and I was
so out of breath.

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,210
I didn’t even run that far!

26
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,380
I think my lifestyle has got more and more
sedentary, plus I’m getting a bit flabby.

27
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,530
Well, good for you!

28
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,260
So, what’s your workout routine going to
be?

29
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,310
I’m not sure.

30
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,880
I want to do a little bit of weight training,
and maybe some running, and just get a bit

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,190
fitter generally.

32
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,150
It’s difficult at the moment, though.

33
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,730
I tried to run 1k yesterday, and I just couldn’t.

34
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,860
Don’t give up!

35
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,470
Doing anything is better than doing nothing.

36
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,740
If you keep trying, it’ll get easier.

37
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,700
You think?

38
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,600
Sure.

39
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,580
When I started running, it was really difficult,
but after a month, I could do 5k.

40
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,180
Not fast, but still, I could do it.

41
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,100
Oh?

42
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,760
5k?

43
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,620
That seems impossible right now.

44
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,060
I guess it’s something to aim for, though.

45
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,600
Go for it!

46
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,540
In the dialogue, you heard some words relating
to fitness and exercise.

47
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,700
We have a challenge for you.

48
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,830
Look at definitions of three words.

49
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,380
Can you remember the words and phrases which
match these definitions?

50
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:34,440
If you want, you can go back and review the
dialogue, and try to find them.

51
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,380
Here are the answers.

52
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,420
‘Work out’ can include many different
types of exercise, but it’s mostly used

53
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,260
for focused training, for example using weights
or doing aerobics.

54
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,770
Generally, when you use the verb ‘work out’,
you mean that you follow a routine of different

55
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,700
exercises.

56
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,450
Nowadays, many of us have *sedentary* lifestyles.

57
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,080
‘Sedentary’ is in the same word family
as the verb ‘sit’.

58
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,580
If you’re sedentary, you spend most of your
time sitting down.

59
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:17,290
If someone doesn’t do much exercise, you
can describe them as ‘unfit’, ‘out of

60
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,250
shape’ or ‘in bad shape’.

61
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:25,120
Be careful: you can use these to describe
yourself, but they could be rude if you use

62
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,070
them to describe someone else.

63
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:34,120
All these words have direct opposites: unfit,
fit; out of shape, in shape; in bad shape,

64
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,520
in good shape.

65
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,160
What about you?

66
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,980
Do you work out?

67
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,640
What do you do?

68
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,760
What can you do to avoid being sedentary if
you have an office job?

69
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,240
What’s the best exercise for someone who’s
out of shape?

70
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,920
Think about how to answer these questions.

71
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,680
Pause the video and try to answer them out
loud.

72
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,780
Ready?

73
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,100
Let’s look at our next point.

74
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,240
I’m hungry.

75
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,720
Shall we order?

76
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,730
Pizza?

77
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,540
No, not for me.

78
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,540
I’m on a diet.

79
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,540
Really?

80
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,540
How come?

81
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,819
I’ve just been eating really badly lately.

82
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:17,980
I’m not trying to lose weight; I just want
to eat more healthily.

83
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,660
It’s nothing drastic; I’m just trying
to stay off junk food, fried food, get my

84
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,300
five a day, and so on.

85
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,880
Yeah, I should probably think about that,
too.

86
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,340
I eat a lot of takeaways and packaged food,
and I definitely don’t eat enough fruit

87
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,680
and vegetables.

88
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,330
I doubt it’s good for me.

89
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,870
I can never stick to a diet, though.

90
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,250
I know what you mean.

91
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,080
I think it’s better to make small changes.

92
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,170
That way, you don’t have to think about
it too much.

93
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,210
True, but I have such a sweet tooth.

94
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:53,300
I find it really hard to resist anything sweet:
cakes, chocolate, biscuits…

95
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,720
If someone offers something like that to me,
I can’t say no.

96
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Another tip that someone told me which works
well: plan your meals in advance.

97
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,100
It works for me, at least.

98
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,540
That’s a good idea.

99
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,690
Let’s look at some sentences you heard.

100
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,910
Can you remember or guess the missing words?

101
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,169
Think about it for a moment!

102
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:18,600
Could you do it?

103
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,900
Let’s check.

104
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,880
Next, what do these key words and phrases
mean?

105
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,580
If you’re overweight, you might try to lose
weight.

106
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,620
The opposite is ‘put on weight’, meaning
to get heavier or fatter.

107
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,000
You can also say ‘gain weight’.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,420
‘Stay off’ means something like ‘avoid’.

109
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,419
It’s often used to talk about bad habits
that you’re trying to give up.

110
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:54,240
So, you might say ‘I’m trying to stay
off sweet food’, or ‘I’m trying to stay

111
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,140
off cigarettes’, or ‘I’m trying to stay
off Netflix’.

112
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,320
‘Five a day’ refers to eating fruit and
vegetables.

113
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:09,000
In many countries, health advice is to eat
at least five portions of fruit and vegetables

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
a day.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,720
It’s often used with the verb ‘get’,
as in ‘I don’t always get my five a day’,

116
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,480
meaning that I don’t always eat enough fruit
and vegetables.

117
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,820
If you stick to something, you continue doing
it.

118
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,430
It’s often used to talk about good habits.

119
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:32,500
So, if you stick to a diet or an exercise
routine, then you do it regularly and don’t

120
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,040
give up.

121
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,320
Finally, if you have a sweet tooth, you…

122
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,800
Wait, can you guess?

123
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,020
What do you think this means?

124
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,800
It means you like sweet food very much.

125
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,479
There are many other useful words and phrases
in the dialogue, so we recommend watching

126
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,620
it again and finding vocabulary you could
use.

127
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,400
Can you use the language from the dialogue
to talk about your diet and eating habits?

128
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,060
Try it!

129
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,900
Beer?

130
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,880
Oh, no thanks.

131
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,400
I’m trying to cut down.

132
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,260
Really?

133
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,800
I didn’t think you were a big drinker.

134
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,350
I’m not, but I’m trying to quit smoking.

135
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,770
I’ve tried five times, and this time I’m
determined to make it stick.

136
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:29,920
I associate smoking with drinking, so I feel
like it’s easier not to drink, too.

137
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
That makes sense.

138
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,199
I’ve heard a lot of people say similar things.

139
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,669
So, how’s it going?

140
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:37,580
It’s been two weeks, which is pretty good.

141
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,389
I still get cravings but they’re not as
strong as they were.

142
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:43,850
I feel much better already, though.

143
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,260
I guess I’m lucky that I’ve never been
tempted by smoking.

144
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,060
Coffee is my vice.

145
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,640
I’ve tried to cut down, but I could never
give it up completely.

146
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,360
Well, coffee’s not so bad, in moderation.

147
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Yeah…

148
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,920
Does six cups a day count as ‘moderation’?

149
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,200
Hmm…

150
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,210
In the dialogue, we were talking about bad
habits.

151
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,620
Let’s look at some key language which you
heard.

152
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,960
Imagine you want to explain these words to
someone who doesn’t know them.

153
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,380
Could you do it?

154
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,620
What would you say?

155
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,069
Pause the video and try it now.

156
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:27,569
Explain these words in English, and give examples.

157
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:28,569
Could you do it?

158
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:30,889
Let’s check together.

159
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,600
‘Cut down’ means to do something less
than before.

160
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,420
For example, if you cut down on sugar, then
you try to eat less.

161
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,720
It doesn’t mean you give it up completely.

162
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,020
‘A big drinker’ means someone who drinks
a lot of alcohol.

163
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,230
You can use ‘big’ in this way with other
things, too.

164
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,339
For example: ‘a big smoker’ or ‘a big
eater’.

165
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,100
A ‘craving’ is a very strong desire for
something.

166
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,110
It’s often used to talk about addictions.

167
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:09,820
For example, if you smoke, and then you stop,
you’ll probably feel cravings – a strong

168
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,180
urge to smoke.

169
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,740
A ‘vice’ is a bad habit.

170
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:20,760
If you say ‘coffee is my vice’, you mean
that you probably drink too much coffee.

171
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:26,410
‘Vice’ literally means something immoral,
so it has a strong meaning, but it’s often

172
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,540
used ironically or in a slightly joking way.

173
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,840
Finally, if you do something in moderation,
you don’t do it too much.

174
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:44,150
For example, if you drink coffee in moderation,
maybe you drink one or two cups a day.

175
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,260
Could you use this language to talk about
your life?

176
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,020
Do you have any bad habits?

177
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,540
Are you trying to cut down on anything at
the moment?

178
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,750
Pause the video and try to make two or three
sentences – or more if you can! – and

179
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,920
say them out loud.

180
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,890
When you’re making
an answer like this, don’t forget to repeat

181
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,680
it several times, until you can speak fluently.

182
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,740
OK?

183
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:15,120
Let’s look at one more topic.

184
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,520
You seem a bit down.

185
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,100
Everything OK?

186
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Urgh…

187
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,690
I have too much work!

188
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,180
You always say that.

189
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,890
Yes, but I’m really under a lot of pressure
right now.

190
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,140
I feel stressed all the time, and I have no
time for myself.

191
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,470
That doesn’t sound healthy.

192
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,230
You can’t just work all day every day.

193
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,040
You’ll burn out eventually.

194
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,420
I know, but what can I do?

195
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,630
Every week there are deadlines, calls, meetings,
problems…

196
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,839
It never stops.

197
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,520
I don’t know, but I think work-life balance
is really important.

198
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:54,250
Since I moved companies two years ago, I make
a lot less money, but I’m much happier.

199
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,160
I don’t regret it.

200
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,370
You only get one life; you can’t spend it
all in the office.

201
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,149
You think I need to change jobs?

202
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:07,250
I don’t know, but I think you need to have
time and energy for your personal life.

203
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,210
Otherwise, it’s difficult to feel good about
life.

204
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:17,370
Let’s start with an important point which
English learners often make mistakes with;

205
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,600
look at one of the first phrases from the
dialogue.

206
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,660
Now, look at another sentence.

207
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,540
What’s the difference?

208
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,060
‘A lot’ is just a fact.

209
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,279
If you have a lot of work, you have a large
quantity of work.

210
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,760
Pretty simple.

211
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,529
‘Too much’ is different, because it also
expresses an opinion.

212
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:47,529
If you have too much work, then you have a
lot of work, *and* you aren’t happy about

213
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:48,899
it.

214
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:54,720
Maybe it’s making you stressed, or you don’t
have time for anything else…

215
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,350
This is true generally.

216
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:04,770
Whenever you use the word ‘too’, you’re
expressing a negative opinion about something.

217
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:10,480
Remember this; although it might seem like
a small difference, it’s important.

218
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,339
So, let’s think about some questions.

219
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,700
Think about how you could answer these.

220
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,740
Pause the video if you need some time to think.

221
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:30,390
Of course, there are many possible answers,
but let’s see one example for each.

222
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,960
Do you have a good work-life balance?

223
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,220
Yes, pretty good in general.

224
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,100
I work hard, but I make sure I stop at six
o’clock at the latest, and I don’t take

225
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,589
work home with me or work at the weekends.

226
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:49,440
If you work too hard, you’ll feel stressed
and miserable, and you won’t have time or

227
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,330
energy for other important parts of your life.

228
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:59,529
I think it’s good to have a fixed routine,
so you start and finish, and take breaks,

229
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,510
at the same time every day.

230
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,800
Also, it’s important to say ‘no’ to
other people sometimes, so that you don’t

231
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,680
have too much to do.

232
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,120
What about you?

233
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,240
Were your answers similar?

234
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,220
If you want, you can share your answers to
these questions in the comments.

235
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,140
That’s the end.

236
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,690
Thanks for watching!

237
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,300
See you next time!
