00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,290
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,290
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,870
In this lesson, you can learn about the IELTS
speaking exam part three.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,090
The IELTS speaking test has three parts.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,930
In this class, you can learn in more detail
about part three of the speaking exam, and

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,720
how to get a better score.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,650
First, let’s review what happens in part
three of the IELTS speaking test.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,680
The examiner will ask you some open-ended
questions about a topic.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,899
The topic is often related to what you spoke
about in part two of the exam.

10
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:41,020
For example, if your topic in part two was
“Talk about a sport you enjoy playing,”

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,890
the topic in part three will almost certainly
be about sports.

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,329
In part three, the examiners want to see if
you can express your opinions clearly.

13
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,199
They also want to see if you can talk about
more abstract topics, not just about you and

14
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,720
your own life.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,460
Also, in part three, the examiner can respond
to what you say and take the conversation

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,140
in different directions.

17
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,340
That means it’s more like a natural conversation
than the other parts of the IELTS speaking

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,350
exam.

19
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,130
The other parts follow a script.

20
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,990
The questions in part three are generally
quite simple.

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,909
However, you need to be careful; just because
the questions are simple, that doesn’t mean

22
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:27,020
your answers should be simple.

23
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,259
The questions give you an opportunity to speak.

24
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:32,820
You need to use that opportunity.

25
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,780
So how can you do that?

26
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,730
Well, let’s take some sample questions on
the topic of sports:

27
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,909
"Do you think that children do less sport
and exercise than in the past?"

28
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,399
Let’s see how you can answer this question
effectively.

29
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,440
Part one: support your opinions.

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,799
The worst answer in part three is a very short
answer.

31
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,060
Don’t say something like,

32
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,030
"Yes, I agree."

33
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,150
It's not enough just to give your opinion;
you also need to support your ideas.

34
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,509
How can you do this?

35
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:11,650
Well, first, try to give a reason.

36
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,010
For example:

37
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,489
"Yes, I agree.

38
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:19,830
Children have more homework and are under
more pressure at school, so they have less

39
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,319
time to play sports or do something outside."

40
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,850
Secondly, try to add an example from your
life.

41
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,620
For example:

42
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,270
"Yes, I agree.

43
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,670
Children have more homework and are under
more pressure at school, so they have less

44
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,780
time to play sports or do something outside.

45
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:43,599
For example, when I was younger, I played
outside with my friends every day after school.

46
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,880
Nowadays, I never see children playing outside."

47
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,349
But, you say, what if I can’t think of a
reason?

48
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:53,410
What if I don't have an example?

49
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,120
No problem—just add one or the other.

50
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,810
But, you say, what if I can’t think of examples
from my life or any reasons?

51
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,930
No problem—just make one up!

52
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,250
For example:

53
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,680
"My friend Sam and his wife have an 8-year-old
daughter.

54
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,360
She has to do around two hours of homework
every day after school.

55
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,640
Of course, this means she’s too tired to
go outside or do anything in the evening.

56
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,420
When I was eight years old, I hardly had any
homework."

57
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,640
Good answer, right?

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,739
But guess what—I don’t have a friend called
Sam!

59
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:32,239
I just made it all up.

60
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,220
It’s a complete lie, and that doesn’t
matter at all.

61
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,610
The examiner doesn’t care if you’re telling
the truth or not.

62
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,610
Using an imaginary friend as an example can
be a very useful.

63
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,790
Here's another trick:

64
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:51,900
"In a recent survey, researchers discovered
that children 30 years ago did five hours

65
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,080
of exercise or physical activity every week.

66
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,760
Now, the average is just one hour of activity
a week."

67
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,689
Again, there was no survey.

68
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:03,120
I just made it up.

69
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,140
I'm lying!

70
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,090
And again: no one cares.

71
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,020
You can do this too.

72
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:15,090
The examiner is not going to stop the exam
to check your research on the Internet.

73
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,090
They don't care.

74
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:23,300
However, remember that this is only for emergencies,
if you can’t think of anything to say—it's

75
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,259
difficult to think of things like this.

76
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,090
It’s always better to use real examples
if you can.

77
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,350
Now it’s your turn.

78
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,070
Think about the question:

79
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:40,280
"Do you think that children do less sport
and exercise than in the past?"

80
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,090
First of all, do you agree or not?

81
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,660
Secondly, why do you agree or disagree?

82
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:54,150
Thirdly, can you think of examples from your
life, or from people you know?

83
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,250
Think about how you would answer this question.

84
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,440
Okay, part two: speculate—talk about possibilities.

85
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:09,110
You can make your answers better in part three
of your IELTS speaking test by speculating.

86
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,650
What's speculating?

87
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,050
What does speculate mean?

88
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,610
Speculating means talking about something
you aren’t sure about.

89
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,270
For example, for our sample question, if you
answer:

90
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:28,750
"Children definitely do less sport and exercise
nowadays, but I’m not sure why that is.

91
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,229
Maybe it’s because they spend more time
online, playing video games and so on."

92
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:37,240
By saying “I’m not sure why that is.

93
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,479
Maybe it’s because…”

94
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,430
By doing this, you are speculating.

95
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,020
You’re talking about something which you
don’t know about, and you’re saying what

96
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,419
could be true.

97
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:50,990
You’re talking about possibilities.

98
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,870
Speculating is a really useful tool.

99
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,960
It lets you extend your answer.

100
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,450
It lets you use advanced language.

101
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:02,039
It also lets you talk about something you
don’t know about.

102
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:07,160
Many students complain that they don’t know
what to say in the IELTS speaking test.

103
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,680
Here's a solution; here's an answer.

104
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,320
You can talk about ideas and things you don’t
know about; you don’t just have to talk

105
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,690
about facts.

106
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,169
So, how can you speculate?

107
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:23,389
There are many simple phrases and structures
you can use.

108
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:28,889
First, use a verb like 'might', 'may', or
'could'.

109
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,060
For example:

110
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,389
"I think children might have less free time
than in the past."

111
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:40,639
"Parents may not be willing to let children
play outside nowadays, especially in big cities."

112
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:47,770
Secondly, you can use a phrase like 'it’s
possible that…' or 'one possible reason

113
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,890
is that…'

114
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,280
For example:

115
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,530
"It’s possible that there aren’t so many
parks and other places where children can

116
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,120
play sport."

117
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,570
Or:
"One possible reason is that parents aren’t

118
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:07,230
interested in sport, so they don’t encourage
their children to play sport and be active."

119
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,300
Thirdly, you can use an if-sentence.

120
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,560
For example,

121
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,270
"If children have more homework nowadays,
of course it’ll be more difficult for them

122
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,120
to play sport."

123
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,580
"Obviously, if children spend lots of time
in front of a screen, they won’t go outside

124
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,460
and do something active."

125
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,690
Speculate as much as possible during part
three of the IELTS speaking exam.

126
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:35,699
It will help you to give longer answers and
get a better score.

127
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,270
Part three: how the other side of the argument.

128
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,139
A lot of IELTS advice sounds the same.

129
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:43,770
“Develop your answers.”

130
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,770
“Add details.”

131
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,690
“Make your answers longer.”

132
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,470
Okay, but how?

133
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:54,400
Here’s the simplest way: don’t just give
your opinion; discuss the opposite opinion

134
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
too.

135
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,819
Let’s stay with our sample question and
answer.

136
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:04,860
To review, you want to agree with the idea
that children do less sport now than before.

137
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,360
You start your answer, you give reasons and
examples, and you speculate.

138
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,120
Next, discuss the other side of the argument.

139
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,930
For example:

140
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,970
"… On the other hand, many of my friends’
children are very active, often more active

141
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,750
than their parents.

142
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,759
It isn’t true that all children are less
active than in the past."

143
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,390
"… However, spending time online can also
help to get children interested in new sports

144
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,469
and activities.

145
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:39,219
It’s much easier to find sports clubs and
activities in your local area nowadays, thanks

146
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,810
to technology."

147
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:46,220
This lets you use linking words like 'on the
other hand' or 'however', and again, this

148
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,500
is all making your answer longer and more
detailed.

149
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,149
We haven’t finished yet, but let’s review
these three points, because they’re all

150
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:56,149
connected.

151
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:01,850
In part three of the IELTS speaking test,
you can improve your answer by: adding reasons

152
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:09,940
to support your opinions; using examples from
your own life; speculating (= talking about

153
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,959
possibilities, and things you aren’t sure
about); and, discussing the other side of

154
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,390
the argument.

155
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,830
If you do all this, you can turn a bad answer:

156
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,750
"Yes, I agree."

157
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,790
Into this:

158
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,920
"Yes, I agree.

159
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,620
Children have more homework and are under
more pressure at school, so they have less

160
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,740
time to play sports or do something outside.

161
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,130
For example, when I was younger, I played
outside with my friends every day after school.

162
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,110
Nowadays, I never see children playing outside.

163
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,190
I’m not sure why that is.

164
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,060
Maybe it’s because they spend more time
online, playing video games and so on.

165
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,620
However, spending time online can also help
to get children interested in new sports and

166
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,620
activities.

167
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,010
It’s much easier to find sports clubs and
activities in your local area now, thanks

168
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,670
to technology."

169
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:05,920
You can see how following a few simple steps
can help you to extend and develop your answer

170
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,079
into something really good.

171
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,480
If you can produce answers like this in part
three of your IELTS speaking exam, you’ll

172
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,940
get a good score.

173
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,089
Okay, I know what you’re thinking.

174
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:20,339
Firstly, you’re thinking: “Well, that’s
easy for you, Mr Native Speaker!

175
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,630
But how can I do it?”

176
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,170
I disagree—I think you can do it.

177
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,430
Here’s why:

178
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:35,320
Most of the IELTS students I meet are around
bands 5-6-7 and their target is maybe 6, 6.5,

179
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,519
7, rarely higher.

180
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,570
If you're at this level, you have the language
to do something like this.

181
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,430
Go back, read the answer again.

182
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,940
It isn’t that complicated.

183
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,440
I don’t use advanced vocabulary or very
complicated grammar.

184
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,860
You can do it!

185
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,399
Maybe with some mistakes, but if you can understand
this video, you can make an answer like this.

186
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,329
It just takes practice.

187
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:03,959
Secondly, maybe you’re thinking: “Thanks
very much, Oli.

188
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,300
Now I know how to answer one question.

189
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,300
How does that help me?

190
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,089
They’re going to ask me different questions
in my exam.”

191
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:16,390
You can use these ideas to answer any question
in part three of the IELTS speaking test.

192
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,810
You can’t possibly prepare for every question
they might ask you.

193
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:25,510
But you can remember to think of reasons,
think of examples, and so on.

194
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,029
This will make your answers better.

195
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:31,640
Next, let’s look at some different advice
for part three:

196
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Number four: use filler phrases to give yourself
thinking time.

197
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,950
Your answers in part three will often be longer
and more complicated compared to part one

198
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:50,280
or part two, so trying to give an answer like
this without thinking could be difficult.

199
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,860
If you start speaking without thinking first,
your answer might be disorganized and difficult

200
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,590
to follow.

201
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,079
So what should you do?

202
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:05,610
If you need a few seconds to think and organize
your thoughts, use a filler phrase.

203
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,990
For example:

204
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,350
"Let me think about that for a second."

205
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,339
"That’s an interesting question."

206
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:15,610
"What can I say about that?"

207
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:22,019
You can also use filler phrases in the middle
of your answer, if you need to pause and think.

208
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,590
For example,

209
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,580
"What else can I say?"

210
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,980
"Let me see—can I think of an example?"

211
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,600
"What other reasons could there be for this?"

212
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,670
Filler phrases are natural—native speakers
use them, so you can use them, too.

213
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:44,389
It's much better to use a filler phrase than
just to sit there in silence.

214
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:49,150
Using filler phrases like this shows the examiner
that you’re really thinking about the question,

215
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,910
and that you have more to say.

216
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,740
On the other hand, don’t use filler phrases
too much.

217
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,589
You can’t use them for every question or
all the time.

218
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:04,920
Save them for the more complicated questions,
when you really need some extra thinking time.

219
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,370
Filler phrases can give you more thinking
time, but what if you really can’t think

220
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,540
of anything to say?

221
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,370
Okay, let's look.

222
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,839
Part five: be honest.

223
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,930
I know we said before that it’s OK to lie
or make up examples, but what if you really

224
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,240
can’t think of anything, even a lie, even
a fake story?

225
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,950
If you really have no ideas about something,
say so.

226
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,090
For example, the examiner asks you:

227
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:36,720
"Do you think that children do less sport
and exercise than in the past?"

228
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,339
You could say:

229
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,260
"I really have no idea.

230
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,269
I don’t have children, and none of my friends
do either.

231
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:47,560
I’m afraid it’s just not a topic I can
say much about."

232
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,079
Be careful: you shouldn’t do this unless
it’s absolutely necessary.

233
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,610
You also need to give a reason why you don’t
have anything to say.

234
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,720
You need to make it clear to the examiner
that it’s not just your English skills which

235
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,209
are stopping you from giving a full answer.

236
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:08,720
Secondly, if you do this, you can only really
do it once.

237
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,300
Finally, even if you do this, you should still
try to speculate.

238
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,930
For example:

239
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,860
"I really have no idea.

240
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,050
I don’t have children, and none of my friends
do either.

241
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:25,269
I’m afraid it’s just not a topic I can
say much about.

242
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:30,810
I suppose that children might be less active
than in the past, because they spend more

243
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:35,860
time online and playing video games and things
like that."

244
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:41,000
You need to put thought into your answer,
and try to add details, even if your answer

245
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,560
is basically “I don’t know.”

246
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,380
Otherwise, it could affect your IELTS score.

247
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:51,950
However, this can save you if you get a question
which you really don’t know how to answer.

248
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:56,449
It won’t affect your score if you make your
reasons clear, and if you put some thought

249
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:58,610
into your answer.

250
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,220
The examiner wants you to speak.

251
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,600
By saying something like this to the examiner,
you’re saying, “I can’t say much about

252
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,310
this, so give me a different question or topic.”

253
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,389
Being honest like this is much better than
trying to answer the question when you have

254
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:16,910
no idea what to say.

255
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,860
Just remember, this is something you can only
use if it's really necessary.

256
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,350
Okay, our last point:

257
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,230
Part six: interact with the examiner.

258
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:33,320
Part three of the IELTS speaking test is different,
because it’s the first time in the speaking

259
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,300
exam that the examiner can actually talk to
you.

260
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,959
In parts one and two, the examiner is reading
a script.

261
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:44,360
He or she has very little freedom to respond
to what you say.

262
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,290
However, part three is different.

263
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:53,360
The examiner can respond to what you say,
and take part in the conversation more.

264
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,430
What does this mean for you?

265
00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:00,360
During part three of the IELTS speaking exam,
you need to listen to what the examiner says,

266
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,520
and think about what he or she wants you to
do.

267
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,329
For example:

268
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:11,590
Is the examiner responding to something you
said, or asking a new question?

269
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:17,019
Is the examiner asking for more details about
something you said?

270
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:22,829
Is the examiner asking you to give your opinion,
or respond to a different opinion?

271
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:27,250
This also means that you shouldn’t expect
to just speak for as long as you want.

272
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,190
The examiner can—and will—jump into the
conversation to ask extra questions, or to

273
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,750
change the direction a little bit.

274
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,970
You need to be flexible in part three.

275
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:42,480
In parts one and two, you’re given questions
and you can answer without being interrupted,

276
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,199
you can say what you want.

277
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:47,120
In part three, you need to interact with the
examiner.

278
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,930
It should be more like a natural conversation,
rather than a question-answer format.

279
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,070
Okay, that’s the end of the lesson on part
three.

280
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,029
I hope all this IELTS advice was useful.

281
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:02,440
If you’ve watched all of our videos on the
IELTS speaking exam, you should now have a

282
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,589
good idea of what to expect and what to do
in the IELTS speaking test.

283
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,589
Good luck if you have an exam coming up!

284
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:13,630

But for today, thanks very much for watching,
see you next time!
