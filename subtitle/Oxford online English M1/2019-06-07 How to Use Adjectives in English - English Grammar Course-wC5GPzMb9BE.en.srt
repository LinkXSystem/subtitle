00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,650
Hi, I’m Daniel.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,640
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,160
In this lesson, you can learn about using
adjectives in English.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,350
You’ll see basic information about English
adjectives, what they do, and how you can

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,350
use them.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,840
Then, you’ll see some more details about
different types of adjectives and what they

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,500
mean.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:29,460

English in online classes.

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:49,140
But now, let’s get back to the lesson.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,220
First, a question: what do adjectives do?

15
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:00,820
Adjectives describe nouns—they add information
to a noun or noun phrase.

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,360
For example: ‘The sea was blue and clear.’

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,300
The adjectives—‘blue’ and ‘clear’—add
information to the noun—‘sea’.

18
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,680
Adjectives can be used in many ways, but there
are two common patterns.

19
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:27,030
First, you can put adjectives directly before
the noun they describe, like this: ‘red

20
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,040
high-heeled shoes’.

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,740
‘A reliable friend.’

22
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:38,640
‘He gave me an expensive Italian leather
wallet.’

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,720
Secondly, you can use a linking verb plus
an adjective after a noun, like this: ‘She

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
felt happy.’

25
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,460
‘It’s sunny.’

26
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,960
‘He seems quiet today.’

27
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,680
By the way, what are ‘linking verbs’?

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,760
Linking verbs add information to a subject.

29
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:06,680
Common linking verbs include ‘be’, ‘seem’,
‘become’, ‘feel’ and ‘appear’,

30
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,700
although there are many others.

31
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,320
You don’t need to worry about this right
now.

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,010
Remember the basic point: adjectives can go
before a noun, or after it.

33
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:24,360
This will become more important later in the
lesson—keep watching to find out why!

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,810
Here’s another question for you: how can
you find the adjectives in a sentence?

35
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,480
What do adjectives look like?

36
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,980
There’s no simple answer to this question.

37
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,749
With all parts of speech, it’s better to
look at full sentences and think about context

38
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:44,780
and meaning.

39
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,700
Let’s do a quick test!

40
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,209
Here are five sentences.

41
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,510
Can you find the adjective or adjectives in
each one?

42
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,380
Pause the video if you need more time to think.

43
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,400
You’ll see the answers in a few seconds.

44
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:03,239
Ready?

45
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,280
Here are the answers.

46
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,709
You can see a few useful points here.

47
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,180
Firstly, adjectives don’t look similar to
each other.

48
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,800
Adjectives can have many different endings,
and they can even end with -ly, like many

49
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,310
adverbs do.

50
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,689
Secondly, adjectives also have different forms.

51
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:35,620
For example, many adjectives have comparative
forms, like ‘good-better’, or superlative

52
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,140
forms, like ‘hard-hardest’.

53
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:46,400
Thirdly, some adjectives are compound, meaning
they’re made from two or more other words.

54
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,520
This is common with numbers, as in ‘a 25-year-old
man’.

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,020
Now, you know some of the basics about adjectives
and how to use them.

56
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:04,380
Let’s go into more detail about different
types of adjectives.

57
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,740
Look at four sentences.

58
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,860
Two are right, and two are wrong.

59
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,069
Can you see which sentences are correct?

60
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:17,940
Do you know why the other two sentences are
incorrect?

61
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,240
Pause the video if you need more time to think
about it.

62
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,360
Ready?

63
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,740
Let’s look together.

64
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,980
Sentences one and four are correct.

65
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,800
Two and three are incorrect.

66
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,400
Did you get the right answers?

67
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,200
And, can you explain why sentences two and
three are incorrect?

68
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,880
To explain this, you need to know about an
important idea: gradability.

69
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,170
Some adjectives are gradable.

70
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,680
That means they can have different levels.

71
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,230
For example, ‘nice’ and ‘interesting’
are gradable.

72
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,920
Something can be more interesting, or less
interesting.

73
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,440
There are different levels of ‘interesting’.

74
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,300
Some adjectives are ungradable.

75
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,310
That means that they’re binary—either
‘yes’ or ‘no’.

76
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,790
For example, ‘unique’ is ungradable.

77
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,810
Either something is unique, or it isn’t.

78
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,350
You can’t have different levels of uniqueness.

79
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,240
It’s a yes-or-no property.

80
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,580
Ungradable adjectives have two types.

81
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:37,200
Firstly, there are words with a strong meaning,
like ‘delicious’, ‘exhausted’ or ‘furious’.

82
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,890
Secondly, there are words with an absolute
meaning, like ‘unique’, ‘true’ or

83
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,890
‘possible’.

84
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:49,680
When we talk about ungradable adjectives,
we mean both of these types.

85
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,440
What does this mean for you?

86
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,330
Well, there are two important rules you should
know.

87
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,770
First, you can’t make comparatives
from ungradable adjectives.

88
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,530
You can’t say ‘more delicious’.

89
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,670
You can’t say ‘truer’ or ‘most possible’.

90
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:13,900
Secondly, if you want to emphasise an adjective
by adding a word like ‘very’, ‘really’

91
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:19,150
or ‘absolutely’ before it, you need to
use different words for gradable and ungradable

92
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,520
adjectives.

93
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,480
‘Very’ is used with gradable adjectives.

94
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,460
So, you can say ‘very beautiful’, ‘very
cold’ or ‘very funny’, but you can’t

95
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,780
say ‘very gorgeous’, ‘very freezing’
or ‘very hilarious’.

96
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:42,200
You can’t say ‘very freezing’, but what
*can* you say?

97
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:49,070
With ungradable adjectives, use ‘absolutely’;
you can say ‘absolutely freezing’, ‘absolutely

98
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,710
exhausted’ or ‘absolutely unique’.

99
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,080
What if you’re not sure?

100
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,990
Use ‘really’, which can be used with both
gradable and ungradable adjectives.

101
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,050
So, you can say ‘really cold’ or ‘really
freezing’.

102
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,080
They’re both fine!

103
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,640
Understanding the difference between gradable
and ungradable adjectives is important if

104
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,460
you want to use adjectives correctly in English.

105
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,980
There’s also one more important point you
should know.

106
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,540
Let’s look!

107
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,420
You heard in part one that adjectives can
go before the noun, or after the noun if you

108
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,220
use a linking verb.

109
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,990
So, are these sentences correct, or not?

110
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:44,220
As always, pause the video if you want to
think about it for longer.

111
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,140
Ready?

112
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,800
Here’s the answer.

113
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,200
All three sentences are incorrect; none of
them are possible.

114
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,270
Do you know why?

115
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,050
Many adjectives can be used either before
or after the noun they describe.

116
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,320
For example, you can say ‘the car is new’
or ‘the new car’.

117
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,520
Both are possible, and it doesn’t change
the meaning.

118
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:15,020
However, some adjectives can only be used
in one position: either before or after the

119
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,020
noun.

120
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,890
That’s the problem with the three sentences
you saw just now.

121
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,840
‘Asleep’ can only be used after the noun
it describes.

122
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:32,419
You can say ‘The cat is asleep on the wall’,
but you can’t say ‘an asleep cat’.

123
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:38,539
‘Main’ and ‘elder’ are examples of
adjectives which can *only* go before the

124
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,539
noun.

125
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:46,040
So, you could say ‘This is the main problem’
or ‘He is my elder brother.’

126
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,960
Now, let’s do a test.

127
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,400
Look at six adjectives:

128
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,180
Here’s the question: can these adjectives

129
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,300
be used before the noun, after the noun, or
in both positions?

130
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:05,350
To do this, try making sentences with the
six adjectives, or go to an online dictionary,

131
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:12,620
such as the Cambridge dictionary or Longman,
and find example sentences.

132
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,570
When you make sentences, try saying them out
loud.

133
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,899
Use your instinct.

134
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:19,639
Does it sound strange or wrong?

135
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,910
It probably is.

136
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,430
Pause the video and do the test.

137
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:28,140
You’ll see the answers in a few seconds!

138
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,220
Ready?

139
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,160
Let’s check together.

140
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,879
‘Alone’ can only be used after the noun
it describes.

141
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,340
For example: ‘He was alone for most of the
summer.’

142
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,460
‘Ill’ is also generally used after the
noun it describes.

143
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,540
For example: ‘I didn’t work yesterday
because my daughter was ill.’

144
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,930
‘Complete’ can be used in both positions.

145
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,190
For example: ‘It was a complete disaster!’

146
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:02,840
Or, ‘The first stage of the work is now
complete.’

147
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,120
‘Only’ is used before the noun.

148
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,240
For example: ‘The only way to do it is to
do it yourself.’

149
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,579
‘Unhappy’ can be used in both positions.

150
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:20,839
For example: ‘They had an unhappy marriage,’
or ‘He didn’t enjoy the last year of school

151
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,860
and was often unhappy.’

152
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,660
Finally, ‘afraid’ is only used after the
noun.

153
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,000
For example: ‘I was afraid of the dark when
I was a child.’

154
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,490
So, you’re probably thinking: how do I know?

155
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:42,690
How do I know whether an adjective can be
used before or after a noun?

156
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,779
It’s a good question.

157
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,240
Unfortunately, there isn’t a simple answer.

158
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,060
Dictionaries don’t usually include this
information.

159
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:57,519
However, we have good news!

160
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,240
Most adjectives can be used in both positions.

161
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,399
Also, for most adjectives which can’t, you
already know the answer.

162
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,390
For example, remember the sentence, ‘The
problem is main’?

163
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,640
Most of you knew that this sentence sounded
wrong.

164
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,709
Your instincts can be helpful!

165
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,940
Anyhow, now you know about gradability and
adjective position.

166
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:26,819
There’s a reason we’ve shown you these
two topics, because our last idea depends

167
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:31,939
on these points.

168
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:36,610
You know that adjectives can be gradable or
ungradable, or that they can go before or

169
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:42,309
after the noun, but in some cases, the same
adjective can be used in different ways with

170
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:44,300
different meanings.

171
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:50,380
For example, look at these two sentences:
‘She handled the situation in a very professional

172
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,380
way.’

173
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,839
‘She’s a professional tennis player.’

174
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,860
Both these sentences use the adjective ‘professional’,
but in different ways.

175
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,339
Can you see the difference?

176
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:09,000
In the first sentence, ‘professional’
is used as a gradable adjective, and it means

177
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,759
something like ‘effective’ or ‘competent’.

178
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:19,250
In the second sentence, ‘professional’
is ungradable: it means that playing tennis

179
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,959
is her job, and she makes money from it.

180
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:29,460
Let’s do another example: ‘Jerome was
present at the meeting.’

181
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:36,180
‘The present situation looks more hopeful
than it has for several months.’

182
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,110
What about here?

183
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:44,410
Can you explain the difference between these
two uses of ‘present’?

184
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:49,180
In the first sentence, ‘present’ is used
after the noun, with a linking verb.

185
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,649
It means that Jerome was there.

186
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:57,320
In the second sentence, ‘present’ is used
before the noun, and it means ‘relating

187
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,880
to now’.

188
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,440
So, in this case, the adjective has different
meanings in different positions.

189
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,400
To be clear, this isn’t flexible.

190
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,369
You can’t choose to use ‘present’ before
a noun to mean ‘there’.

191
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:18,339
If you use ‘present’ before a noun, then
it means ‘relating to now’.

192
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,610
So, what should you take away from this?

193
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,730
What do you need to focus on?

194
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:31,050
We aren’t showing you these points because
you need to learn lists of all the gradable

195
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,420
and ungradable adjectives.

196
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:40,740
This lesson gives you tools to help you understand
adjectives more deeply.

197
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:47,319
The most important point is that adjectives
don’t follow one simple set of rules.

198
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:53,980
Like with all vocabulary, you need to use
context to understand what an adjective means

199
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,369
in a sentence.

200
00:13:55,369 --> 00:14:01,050
Next—and this is also a general point—one
word doesn’t have one meaning.

201
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:06,209
With adjectives, whether a word is gradable
or not can make a difference.

202
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:09,269
Where an adjective is used can make a difference.

203
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:12,980
You can’t simply rely on a dictionary or
a translator.

204
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,890
Again, you need to understand the context
to understand the words.

205
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:23,119
Do you find anything especially confusing
about using English adjectives and adverbs?

206
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:25,290
We’re sure you aren’t alone!

207
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,649
Share your ideas in the comments, and maybe
you’ll get some help.

208
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:31,430
Thanks for watching!

209
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,220
See you next time!
