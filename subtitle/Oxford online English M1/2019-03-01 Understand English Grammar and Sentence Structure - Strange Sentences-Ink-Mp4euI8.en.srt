00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,730
Hi, I’m Marie.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,900
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,370
In this lesson, you’re going to see nine
strange sentences.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,309
Have you seen the nine sentences yet?

5
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,620
If not, look below the video and read them.

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,160
What do you think?

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,760
Which ones are correct?

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,680
Actually, all nine sentences are correct.

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,500
But, we’re sure at least some of these sentences
look weird to you.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,550
In this video, we’ll analyse each of these
sentences, so that you can understand how

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,520
they work.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,640
Look at our first three sentences: ‘Have
you ever had to have a tooth extracted?’

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,880
‘I would have had to stay longer if I hadn’t
had to go to have my car repaired.’

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:55,870
‘All the medicine he had had had had little
effect.’

15
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,930
What connects these three sentences?

16
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,890
All three sentences play with different ways
to use ‘have’.

17
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:10,410
‘Have’ can be a main verb which describes
a state, like ‘I have a new computer,’

18
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:16,840
or which describes an action, like ‘I’m
having lunch right now.’

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:24,760
‘Have’ can also be an auxiliary verb,
which is used in perfect verb forms.

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,800
There’s the verb ‘have to’, which you
use to talk about obligations and rules.

21
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,920
Finally, there are some fixed phrases with
‘have’, like ‘have something done’,

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,460
which you use when you pay someone else to
do something for you.

23
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:46,780
For example, you could say, ‘I had my hair
cut yesterday,’ meaning that you paid someone

24
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,420
else to cut your hair.

25
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:55,340
When you use many of these forms of ‘have’
in one sentence, you can get strange results,

26
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,160
like: ‘Have you ever had to have a tooth
extracted?’

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,920
Here, you use ‘have’ in three different
ways.

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,459
The first ‘have’ is an auxiliary verb,
because the question is present perfect.

29
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:17,370
The second ‘have’ is part of the verb
‘have to’, to talk about an obligation.

30
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,500
Finally, the third ‘have’ is part of the
phrase ‘have a tooth extracted’.

31
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,599
What does this mean?

32
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,560
Do you remember?

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,349
It means that you’re paying someone else
to do something for you.

34
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:36,389
Here, it means that you’re paying a dentist
to pull your tooth out; you’re not trying

35
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,489
to do it yourself.

36
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:43,900
So, can you explain the meaning of the full
sentence?

37
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,360
The question is asking about your past experience,
and whether you’ve ever needed to go to

38
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,400
the dentist’s to have a tooth pulled out.

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,519
Does this make sense now?

40
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,900
If not, remember that you can always go back
and review parts of the video which are difficult

41
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,989
for you.

42
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:05,989
Let’s look at our next sentence: ‘I would
have had to stay longer if I hadn’t had

43
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,090
to go to have my car repaired.’

44
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,180
Can you work out what’s going on here?

45
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:19,549
Here’s a clue: it’s similar to the last
sentence you saw, but a little more complicated.

46
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:22,049
The first ‘have’ is an auxiliary.

47
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,709
You use ‘have’ after ‘would’ to show
that you’re talking about the past.

48
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:32,329
In this case, you’re talking about the imaginary
past: something which didn’t really happen.

49
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:38,560
Then, you use ‘have to’ to talk about
an obligation.

50
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,939
The third ‘have’, after ‘if’, is another
auxiliary.

51
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:47,779
Again, you use ‘have’ here to show that
you’re talking about the past, in this case

52
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,760
the imaginary past.

53
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,579
There’s another ‘have to’, again expressing
an obligation.

54
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:01,669
The final ‘have’ is part of the phrase
‘have my car repaired’, meaning that you’re

55
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:05,450
paying someone else to repair your car for
you.

56
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:12,320
Now, you should be able to explain the overall
meaning of the sentence; can you do it?

57
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,340
The sentence means that you needed to take
your car to be repaired, but if you hadn’t

58
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,180
needed to do this, you would have needed to
stay longer at the meeting or event or whatever

59
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,240
you’re talking about.

60
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,030
What about our last sentence?

61
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,280
‘All the medicine he had had had had little
effect.’

62
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,449
This one is a little different.

63
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:35,710
Can you see what’s happening here?

64
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:42,030
Two of the ‘hads’ are auxiliary verbs,
and two are main verbs.

65
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,169
This sentence is talking about sometime in
the past, and it says that all of the medicine

66
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:51,330
he had taken before that time hadn’t worked.

67
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:56,650
The sentence uses two meanings of ‘have’:
‘have medicine’, meaning to take medicine,

68
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:02,470
and ‘have an effect’, which is a fixed
collocation, like ‘have a result’ or ‘have

69
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,710
an influence’.

70
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,710
This sentence looks very confusing when it’s
written down, but in speech it hopefully sounds

71
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,710
more logical.

72
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:15,460
Let's try once more: ‘All the medicine he h/ə/d
had || h/ə/d had little effect.’

73
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,550
The two auxiliary verbs are pronounced weakly,
meaning that the ‘h’ sound either partly

74
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:27,419
or completely disappears, and the vowel sound
is reduced to a schwa: /ə/.

75
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:34,349
The main verbs have their full pronunciation,
with /h/ and a full vowel sound: /hæd/.

76
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:40,319
Also, this sentence is very grammatically
simple; there’s a subject: ‘all the medicine

77
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,530
he had had’, a verb, ‘had had’, and
a complement: ‘little effect’.

78
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,419
You can hear that there’s a short pause
between the subject and the verb.

79
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:55,580
This helps to make all of the ‘hads’ clear
to your listener.

80
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,560
This is an important point, especially for
your listening: ‘have’ as an auxiliary

81
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,289
verb needs to be reduced and pronounced weakly
in most cases, while ‘have’ in main verbs

82
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:09,740
keeps its full pronunciation.

83
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,580
And if you’re thinking, ‘pronounced weakly’?

84
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,250
What is he talking about?

85
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,200
Learn about weak forms; there’s at least
one video on our channel which will explain

86
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,419
this to you, and it’s a really useful topic
to study.

87
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:29,760
Okay, let’s move on and look at our next
group of sentences.

88
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:36,680
Let’s read the sentences together: ‘The
party was almost over at around ten thirty.’

89
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,520
‘The cat jumped out from behind the sofa.’

90
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,460
‘She gets in in the morning.’

91
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,680
Before we look at these, we want to ask you
a question.

92
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,120
What do prepositions do?

93
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,419
Prepositions can do many things.

94
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:59,900
They can be used to express time, like ‘It
starts at eight o’clock.’

95
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:05,849
They can be used to express where something
is; for example, ‘It’s in the cupboard,

96
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:08,039
on the bottom shelf.’

97
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,420
They can express motion, as in, ‘She walked
towards the lake.’

98
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:19,120
Prepositions can be used in combination with
nouns, verbs, or adjectives; they can also

99
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,660
be used in phrasal verbs, like ‘get up’.

100
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,340
Finally, prepositions can also function as
adjectives in some cases.

101
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:32,810
For example, the preposition ‘over’ can
be used to mean ‘finished’.

102
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,569
Like you saw with the different meanings of
‘have’, when you combine all of these

103
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:41,310
different ways to use prepositions in one
sentence, you can get some strange-looking

104
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,320
results.

105
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,479
Let’s look at our first sentence: ‘The
party was almost over at around ten thirty.’

106
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,270
This sentence contains three prepositions
all together.

107
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,990
What are they all doing?

108
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,199
The first, ‘over’, technically isn’t
a preposition; it’s an adjective which describes

109
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,490
the noun ‘party’, and it means ‘finished’.

110
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:10,389
Then, you have two prepositions describing
when the party finished: ‘at around ten

111
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,810
thirty’.

112
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,080
The second sentence is similar.

113
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,830
The word ‘out’ is technically an adverb;
it adds information to the verb ‘jumped’;

114
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,780
then, you have two prepositions in a row.

115
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:29,090
Let’s look: ‘The cat jumped out from behind
the sofa.’

116
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,220
Can you explain what the prepositions are
doing here?

117
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:38,240
‘Out’—which, remember, is an adverb—goes
with the verb ‘jump’.

118
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,200
The cat jumped out, meaning that the cat wasn’t
visible before it jumped.

119
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,830
Then, the two prepositions describe the movement
and position of the cat.

120
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,450
They tell you where the cat was before it
jumped out: it was behind the sofa.

121
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:59,100
Overall, the sentence means that the cat was
hidden behind the sofa, and then it jumped

122
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,220
out and you saw it.

123
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:07,430
Finally, let’s look at our last sentence,
which is possibly the most confusing!

124
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,040
She gets in in the morning.

125
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,900
Can you see what’s happening here?

126
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,210
Although it looks strange to have the word
‘in’ twice in a row, it’s both logical

127
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,960
and quite common in English.

128
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,580
Like the other sentences in this section,
one of the ‘ins’ isn’t actually a preposition.

129
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,970
The first ‘in’ is an adverb, and it’s
part of the phrasal verb ‘get in’, meaning

130
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,160
to arrive.

131
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,880
Then, the second ‘in’ is a preposition
of time: it tells you when she arrives.

132
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,270
So, the meaning of this sentence is: ‘She
arrives in the morning.’

133
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,560
There’s something which connects all of
the sentences you’ve seen.

134
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,250
These sentences can be confusing because the
same word in English can do many different

135
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,250
jobs.

136
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,370
For example, ‘have’ can be a main verb
or an auxiliary verb.

137
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,950
‘In’ can be an adverb or a preposition.

138
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:08,090
If you understand parts of speech and how
these sentences are constructed, you’ll

139
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:12,840
see that all of these sentences follow the
rules, even if they look weird!

140
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:19,380
Next, let’s look at our last group of sentences.

141
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,860
Let’s read the sentences together: ‘That
said, that article that I read argues that

142
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,000
that interpretation is incorrect.'

143
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,060
‘If it’s like that, then that’s it.’

144
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,860
‘There are their bags, over there.’

145
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,900
Again, these sentences are confusing because
the same word, like ‘that’ or ‘there’,

146
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,260
can do more than one job.

147
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:48,320
Also, in one sentence, you have to deal with
homophones—words which have the same pronunciation,

148
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,160
but a different meaning.

149
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Let’s start with a question: what does ‘that’
mean?

150
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,540
How many ways can you think of to use ‘that’?

151
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,360
First, ‘that’ can be used as a determiner,
like ‘this’ or ‘these’.

152
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:09,040
You can use ‘that’ to point to one thing
which is distant from you.

153
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,310
You can use ‘that’ as a conjunction, for
example, ‘She told me that I had a nice

154
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,310
voice.’

155
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:21,620
‘That’ can be a relative pronoun, similar
to ‘who’ or ‘which’.

156
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,970
Finally, ‘that’ is used in many fixed
phrases, like ‘that’s it’, which means

157
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,070
that something is finished.

158
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,390
With this information, can you understand
what’s happening in our sentences?

159
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,430
If not, don’t worry; we’ll look together!

160
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:42,130
Look at the first sentence: ‘That said,
that article that I read argues that that

161
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,640
interpretation is incorrect.’

162
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,750
First, you have ‘that said’, which is
a linking phrase.

163
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,950
‘That said’ introduces a contrasting idea.

164
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:57,830
It’s similar to words like ‘however’,
although it’s more colloquial.

165
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,520
The second ‘that’ goes with the word ‘article’.

166
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,600
It means that you referred to this article
before.

167
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,970
The third ‘that’ is a relative pronoun.

168
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:12,630
It has the same meaning as ‘which’, and
you could also use ‘which’ in this sentence

169
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,580
without changing the meaning.

170
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,880
Then, the fourth ‘that’ is a conjunction
which goes with the verb ‘argue’.

171
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,320
It’s not necessary; you could leave it out
of the sentence and it would still be correct.

172
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,660
Finally, the fifth ‘that’ specifies the
word ‘interpretation’.

173
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,670
Like ‘that article’, this means that you’ve
mentioned this before, and now you’re referring

174
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,490
back to it.

175
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,560
For this sentence, pronunciation is also very
important if you’re reading it aloud.

176
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:50,000
‘That’ used as a relative pronoun or a
conjunction is often pronounced weakly: /ðət/.

177
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:55,200
When you use ‘that’ as a determiner, or
in phrases like ‘that said’, it has its

178
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,320
full pronunciation: /ðæt/.

179
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,250
Listen and try to hear the difference: /ðæt/
said, /ðæt/ article /ðət/ I read argues

180
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,500
/ðət/ /ðæt/ interpretation is incorrect.

181
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,020
Using the weak and strong pronunciations correctly
helps your listener to understand the grammatical

182
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,860
structure of the sentence.

183
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,710
What about our second sentence?

184
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:23,240
Let’s read it together: ‘If it’s like
that, then that’s it.’

185
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,830
This sentence is hard to understand not only
because of the different uses of ‘that’,

186
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,130
but because it has no context.

187
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:36,650
First, let’s try to understand the end of
the sentence: ‘that’s it’.

188
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,820
Have you seen this phrase before?

189
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,540
Do you know what it means?

190
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,430
‘That’s it’ means something is finished.

191
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,620
For example, imagine you’re ordering some
food in a café.

192
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,930
You order some sandwiches, some muffins, some
coffee, and so on.

193
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,710
The server asks you, “Would you like anything
else?”

194
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:01,480
You answer, “No thanks; that’s it,”
meaning that you’ve finished your order.

195
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:07,060
The first ‘that’ in this sentence refers
to something which has been mentioned before,

196
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,710
but without context there’s no way to know
what it means.

197
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,790
Let’s try to give the sentence some context.

198
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,760
Imagine you have a car, and your car breaks
down.

199
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,250
You have to take it to the garage to have
it repaired.

200
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:27,120
They call you and tell you that the car needs
a new engine, and that the new engine will

201
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,300
cost more than the car is worth.

202
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,700
What would you do in this situation?

203
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,280
Would you pay for the new engine?

204
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,260
Probably not.

205
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:42,880
You might say, “If it’s like that, then
that’s it,” meaning that if the situation

206
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,600
is like this, then your car is junk, and there’s
no point trying to repair it.

207
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,790
So, this sentence is probably quite pessimistic.

208
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,420
It’s the kind of thing you might say to
admit defeat.

209
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:02,240
You’re saying, ‘If that’s the way things
are, then there’s no point trying any more.’

210
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,160
What about our last sentence?

211
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,510
This one is slightly different: ‘There are
their bags, over there.’

212
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,000
There are two points to think about here.

213
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,590
First, ‘there’ has more than one meaning.

214
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:20,300
‘There’ can be used to say that something
exists, as in, ‘There’s a snake in the

215
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,530
toilet!’

216
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:26,730
‘There’ can also refer to a place which
is distant from you.

217
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,910
Secondly, words can have the same pronunciation
but different spellings and different meanings,

218
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:37,990
like ‘there’ T-H-E-R-E and ‘their’
T-H-E-I-R.

219
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:43,200
In this sentence, the first ‘there’ is
used to say that something exists.

220
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,320
The second ‘there’ is used to refer to
a place.

221
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,050
‘Over there’ means a place which you can
see, but which is not close to you.

222
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,590
‘Their bags’ explains who the bags belong
to.

223
00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:00,390
So, this sentence could be an answer to the
question, ‘Where are their bags?’

224
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:05,550
They’ve lost their bags, and someone wants
to know where they are.

225
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:10,530
You see them somewhere, so you answer, ‘There
are their bags,’ and then you point to the

226
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,320
bags as you say, ‘over there.’

227
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,600
What about you?

228
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,830
Can you think of any examples of weird sentences
which you find really confusing?

229
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,770
Let us know in the comments!

230
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,610
Thanks for watching!

231
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,360
See you next time!
