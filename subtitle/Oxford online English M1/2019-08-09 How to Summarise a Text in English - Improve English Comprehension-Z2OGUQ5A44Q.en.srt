00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,380
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,650
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,660
In this lesson, you can learn how to read
and summarise a text.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,040
Summarising a text is a vital skill for your
English reading.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,580
If you can’t make a short, clear summary
of the main ideas of a text, then you almost

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,940
certainly haven’t understood it fully.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:27,100
Understanding what you read in English isn’t
just about the words; it’s about understanding

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:33,520
the ideas, how they’re organised, and which
ideas are more or less important.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,440
Here, you’ll see some strategies you can
use to improve your English reading, read

10
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:42,500
faster, and improve your reading comprehension.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,749

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,090
In this lesson, we’ll work with a sample
text.

19
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,859
You’ll see it in the video, but you can
also find it on the full version of this lesson,

20
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:13,530
which is on our website.

21
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,670
You can find a link in the video description.

22
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,039
We recommend reading it before you continue
watching.

23
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:29,780
Now, let’s look at the most important reading
strategy you need to use.

24
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,499
To understand and summarise a text, you need
to find the main idea.

25
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:40,649
Every coherent text has one central idea,
which connects the different parts of the

26
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:41,979
text.

27
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:44,380
You need to know what this is.

28
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:50,679
But, every text is different, and there isn’t
one way to find the main idea.

29
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:54,300
Instead, you need to look at the whole thing.

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,899
Here are some things you should look at:

31
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:01,319
One: is there a title or headings?

32
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,939
These will often highlight the most important
points.

33
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:08,310
Two: what is the first sentence about?

34
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:14,670
Often, the first sentence of a text or paragraph
will summarise the main ideas.

35
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,319
Three: what does most of the text talk about?

36
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,360
Look at each sentence and paragraph.

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,599
Is there a single topic which connects them?

38
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,319
Look at our sample text and think about these
questions.

39
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:34,290
Pause the video if you need more reading time,
and remember that you can also read it on

40
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,430
our website—just follow the link in the
video description.

41
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:46,400
So, what do you think the main idea of our
sample text is?

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,420
We’ll show you three possible summaries.

43
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:55,379
Which do you think is best?

44
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,720
What do you think?

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,599
The best is number three.

46
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,379
Let’s see why.

47
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,010
First, you should look at the title.

48
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,870
The title tells you that the text will be
about Guugu Yimithirr, but it also mentions

49
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,750
that this language is ‘unusual’.

50
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,140
You should immediately focus on this word,
because it shows that this language is different

51
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,480
in some way.

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,170
Also, ‘unusual’ could mean many things.

53
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,820
What does it mean here?

54
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,380
Unusual how?

55
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,000
Second, what’s the first sentence about?

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,950
Here, it gives background information.

57
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,019
It doesn’t help you to find the main idea.

58
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,180
That’s OK—in this case, the background
information is helpful, because most people

59
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,170
don’t know what Guugu Yimithirr is.

60
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,810
Third, what does most of the text talk about?

61
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,540
Apart from the first sentence, every sentence
is about the same topic: the fact that Guugu

62
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,320
Yimithirr uses compass directions—north,
south, east, west—for all directions, because

63
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,900
there are no words for ‘left’, ‘right’,
and so on.

64
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,500
This answers the question you found in the
title: why is this language unusual?

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,280
Now you have a reason.

66
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,080
However, analysing the text in this way is
complex, and there are other sub-skills you

67
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
might need.

68
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:25,160
Let’s look at an important example.

69
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:32,360
To summarise a text, you need to find which
ideas are general, and which are details or

70
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
examples.

71
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,690
The general ideas will give you the overall
meaning.

72
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,770
If you confuse general ideas and details,
you might misunderstand the overall meaning

73
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,090
what you’re reading.

74
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,090
Unfortunately, there are no clear markers
which show you what’s general or not.

75
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,530
A single sentence might mix general ideas
and details together.

76
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,190
You need to use context and other clues to
work out which ideas are general and which

77
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,260
are details.

78
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,220
Look at five extracts from our sample text.

79
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,220
What do you think?

80
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,640
Are these general ideas, or details?

81
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,840
Which do you need to understand in order to
find the overall meaning?

82
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,760
Sentences one, three and four are general.

83
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,200
Two and five are details.

84
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,860
One is general because it introduces the topic
by giving background information.

85
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,170
This is like a topic sentence, which tells
you what the rest of the text will be about.

86
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,630
Two is a detail.

87
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:45,860
It’s more background information; you don’t
need it to understand the overall meaning.

88
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,930
Three is a general, important idea.

89
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:55,020
This sentence highlights the unusual feature
of the Guugu Yimithirr language.

90
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,960
The rest of the text expands on the idea introduced
in this sentence.

91
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,090
We said that four is general; however, it’s
kind of in the middle.

92
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,420
It explains the exact meaning of ‘lacking
egocentric directions’ which is referred

93
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,600
to in sentence three.

94
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,570
Technically, this sentence isn’t necessary
to understand the main idea.

95
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,290
On the other hand, most people—including
educated native English speakers—wouldn’t

96
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,700
know what ‘egocentric directions’ are.

97
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:32,020
This sentence explains it, and so it *is*
important for understanding the whole text.

98
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,610
Five is a detail.

99
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,910
It adds an example of how Guugu Yimithirr
speakers talk about position and direction,

100
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,210
but it isn’t necessary to understand the
main idea.

101
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,360
So, what do you need to focus on here?

102
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,870
First, it’s a good idea to skim a text first,
reading fast and trying to understand the

103
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,320
overall idea in a simple way.

104
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,900
In order to separate general ideas from details,
you need some context.

105
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,710
Until you’ve read the whole thing, you won’t
have this.

106
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:12,180
Second, look for linking phrases like ‘for
example’, ‘for instance’, ‘specifically’

107
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,020
or ‘in particular.’

108
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:20,120
Linking phrases like these show you that what
follows is an explanation of a more general

109
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,880
idea that was mentioned before.

110
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,090
Third, remember that one sentence can contain
both general ideas and details mixed together.

111
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:34,210
For example, this sentence contains both a
detail—about the word ‘kangaroo’—and

112
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,870
a general point.

113
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,910
Now, why not do some more practice?

114
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,710
Look at the rest of our sample text.

115
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,460
Which ideas are general?

116
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,180
Which ideas are details?

117
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,080
Pause the video and try it now, if you want.

118
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,770
Did you do it?

119
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:03,340
Here’s a shorter version, with all examples
and details removed.

120
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,280
If you can do this, you’ll be able to read
much faster.

121
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,530
Why?

122
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:13,490
Because you only need to focus on the general
ideas to understand the overall meaning.

123
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:19,650
Here, you only need to understand 76 words,
instead of 230.

124
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,210
This saves you time, which could be helpful
if you are under time pressure, like in an

125
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,050
IELTS reading exam.

126
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:31,360
There’s another related, skill which can
help you to understand a text.

127
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,720
Let’s look!

128
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,209
If you’re a non-native speaker reading in
English, you’ll probably have this problem

129
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:44,750
often: there are words which you don’t understand.

130
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,180
Maybe there are several words which you don’t
know.

131
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,389
Don’t panic!

132
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:53,769
This makes things more difficult, but there
are strategies you can use.

133
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:58,279
First, look for proper nouns, which start
with a capital letter.

134
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:03,160
Sometimes, we see that students think they
don’t understand a word, but they don’t

135
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,580
realise that the ‘word’ is actually a
proper noun, like a person’s name, or a

136
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,490
place name.

137
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,769
Can you find three examples of proper nouns
in our text?

138
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:18,839
Pause the video if you want time to think
about it.

139
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:26,360
You could say ‘Guugu Yimithirr’, ‘Queensland’,
‘Hopevale’, ‘English’ or ‘Brisbane’.

140
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:34,550
Generally, if a proper noun is important or
not widely-understood, it will be explained.

141
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:39,959
For example, ‘Guugu Yimithirr’ is obviously
important, and it’s explained in the first

142
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,050
sentence.

143
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:47,670
If a proper noun isn’t explained, you can
usually ignore it, or try to work out the

144
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,689
meaning from the context.

145
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:55,699
For example, look at the first sentence.

146
00:09:55,699 --> 00:10:00,649
Even if you’ve never heard of Queensland
or Hopevale, you can work out that they’re

147
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:02,310
place names.

148
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:07,480
Next, look for words that tell you that an
idea is important.

149
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:14,079
You could look for words like ‘important’,
‘notable’, ‘significant’ or ‘essential’.

150
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,829
For example, you saw this sentence.

151
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:23,750
The word ‘notable’ highlights something
important about the language.

152
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,930
This means you should focus on this sentence.

153
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,600
If you’re under time pressure, you should
spend extra time on this sentence.

154
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,499
Also, look for words which were also used
in the title, or possibly which appeared in

155
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:41,170
the first sentence or paragraph.

156
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:48,050
Remember that writers might use paraphrase,
so you might not find the exact same words.

157
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,649
There was a key word from the title used in
the text.

158
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,310
Do you know where?

159
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:58,220
Pause the video if you want time to find it!

160
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:04,050
The word ‘unusual’ appears in this sentence.

161
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,779
You heard before that ‘unusual’ is a key
word in the title.

162
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:12,360
So, when you see it, you should pay extra
attention to this sentence.

163
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,329
In fact, this sentence gives you one of the
key general ideas.

164
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:23,860
Depending on your situation, you might have
different options to deal with unknown words.

165
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:29,560
If you have unlimited time, unlimited patience
and access to a dictionary, then you can check

166
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,080
the meaning of every word.

167
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,079
However, this strategy is not possible in
most cases.

168
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,949
No one really has unlimited time or unlimited
patience.

169
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:47,529
Plus, there are often restrictions; if you’re
taking an exam, you’ll have a time limit

170
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:52,160
and you probably won’t be able to use a
dictionary.

171
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,430
This is why it’s important to focus on the
general ideas, and then find key words within

172
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,430
them.

173
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,230
If there are 50 words you don’t know, that’s
difficult to deal with.

174
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:07,339
However, if you can focus on a smaller number
of more important sentences, there will be

175
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:09,970
fewer unknown words.

176
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,810
At this point, you should know how to read
and summarise a text in English.

177
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,470
We have a challenge for you!

178
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,870
On the full version of this lesson, which
is on our website, you’ll find a second

179
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,850
text to practise with.

180
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,600
If you’re watching on YouTube, you can find
a link in the video description.

181
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,089
Can you write a summary of the second text?

182
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:37,470
Your summary should be maximum two sentences,
or ideally just one.

183
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,040
Use the reading techniques you saw in this
lesson.

184
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,220
Post your suggestion in the comments, and
read other people’s ideas.

185
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,459
Thanks for watching!

186
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:47,190
See you next time!
