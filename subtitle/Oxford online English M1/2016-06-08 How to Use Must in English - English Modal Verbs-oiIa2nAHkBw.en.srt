00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,630
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,060
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,990
In this lesson, you can learn about the verb
'must'.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,870
'Must' can have many different meanings in
English.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:20,100
In this video, you can learn about the different
meanings of 'must', and how to use 'must'

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,780
in English.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,930
Part one, using 'must' to talk about obligations.

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:32,410
First, you can use must to talk about obligations
and rules.

9
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,500
For example:

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,390
"I must remember to call her—it’s her
birthday."

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,390
This is an obligation.

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,090
It’s very important to me.

13
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:48,420
"All passengers must hold a valid ticket."

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,650
This is a rule.

15
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,790
You can't choose to travel without a ticket.

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,829
These are things that it is necessary or important
to do.

17
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:02,190
If you must do something, you have no choice.

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,280
When you use must for obligations, it can
mean that the obligation is important to you

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,600
personally.

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,850
It’s not just a rule that someone else made;
using 'must' means that something matters

21
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,350
to you.

22
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,300
For example:

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:24,930
"You must be here on time, otherwise we’ll
miss the start."

24
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,470
Using 'must' shows that you care about whatever
you’re going to see.

25
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,800
Maybe you’re going to see a concert that
you’ve been looking forward to for ages,

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,360
and you’ll be really unhappy if you miss
even a minute of it.

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,900
"I must finish this work today."

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:52,220
Again, this means that I feel strongly about
this.

29
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,670
Maybe I promised someone that I would finish
it by today, and it’s important to me that

30
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,970
I keep my promise.

31
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:07,340
When talking about rules, we mostly use 'must'
in formal or written English.

32
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,459
For example:

33
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,329
"All candidates must show valid ID."

34
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:20,159
This is a rule probably in an examination
hall, which of course is a formal setting.

35
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,629
"Employees must wash their hands before working
with food."

36
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:29,239
This could be from a sign in a restaurant
or café.

37
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:35,260
Again, this is more likely to be written than
spoken.

38
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:41,620
In informal English, we mostly use the verb
'have to' to talk about rules and obligations.

39
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,950
To review, you can use 'must' to express an
obligation if the obligation is important

40
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:53,469
to you personally, or if you want to sound
more formal.

41
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:58,079
Part two, using 'must' to talk about prohibition.

42
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:03,939
You can use 'mustn’t' to say that something
is not allowed or forbidden.

43
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:09,549
This is the opposite of using must to talk
about obligations or rules, and is similar

44
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:11,590
in meaning.

45
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,189
Look at some examples:

46
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:17,609
"You mustn’t smoke here."

47
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:22,349
That means smoking is forbidden; it’s against
the rules to smoke here.

48
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:25,959
"Mobile phones must not be used while the
plane is flying."

49
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,409
Again, this means that it’s forbidden to
use phones.

50
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:38,129
'Must' expresses the idea that you don’t
have a choice.

51
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:44,709
If you mustn’t smoke here, then it’s not
OK to smoke, and you don’t have a choice.

52
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:50,829
'Mustn’t' with this meaning is similar to
'can’t'.

53
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:56,959
With obligations and rules, we mostly use
'must' in formal or written English, and 'have

54
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,829
to' in informal English, as we said before.

55
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:06,139
However, you can use 'mustn’t' in both formal
and informal English.

56
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:11,019
Part three: using 'must' to give strong advice.

57
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:17,720
'Must' can be used to give someone advice
or a recommendation.

58
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
For example:

59
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,410
"You must read this book—it’s amazing!"

60
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,849
"If you go to Paris, you must take a walk
by the river at night."

61
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:33,270
"We must hire some new staff as soon as possible."

62
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,570
In these examples, ''must' has a strong meaning.

63
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,570
If I say:

64
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,680
"You must read this book—it’s amazing!"

65
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,940
I don’t mean that you have an obligation
to read it.

66
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,770
I mean that I really, really recommend this
book.

67
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,090
In the same way, if I say:

68
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,520
"If you go to Paris, you must take a walk
by the river at night."

69
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,900
This is advice or a recommendation.

70
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,569
It doesn’t mean that it’s a rule or an
obligation.

71
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:09,669
Sometimes, the meaning of 'must' depends on
the context.

72
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:10,960
For example:

73
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,650
"We must hire some new staff as soon as possible."

74
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:21,759
'Must' here could mean that hiring new staff
is necessary, and it’s an obligation, or

75
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,169
it could be a strong recommendation.

76
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:30,189
How do you know what 'must' means in a sentence
like this?

77
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:35,560
In a sentence like this, in a lesson, where
there’s no context, you can’t say exactly

78
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,550
what 'must' means.

79
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:43,569
In real life, the meaning would depend on
the context: who’s speaking, what the situation

80
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:46,810
is, and so on.

81
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,360
When you use 'must' in this way, you can’t
use the negative.

82
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,990
There’s no way to use 'mustn’t' to give
advice or make recommendations.

83
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,419
Only the positive form—'must'—can have
this meaning.

84
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:05,031
Part four: using 'must' to talk about logical
necessity.

85
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:12,490
Finally, 'must' can be used to make deductions.

86
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,360
What are deductions?

87
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,379
Well, look at some examples, and then I’ll
explain what this means:

88
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,979
"They must be rich.

89
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:25,030
Their house is huge!"

90
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:32,639
"It must be a difficult exam—only 10% of
candidates pass."

91
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,240
"It must have rained last night."

92
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,470
Take the first sentence:

93
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,310
"They must be rich.

94
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,090
Their house is huge!"

95
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,080
Do we know they’re rich?

96
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,229
No, we don’t know for a fact.

97
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:52,139
But, we do know that they have a huge house.

98
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,680
Huge houses cost a lot of money.

99
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,560
Therefore, they must be rich.

100
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,960
We’re sure that they’re rich, because
otherwise they couldn’t afford such a big

101
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,710
house.

102
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,470
Compare:

103
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,189
"They must be rich."

104
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:10,900
"They’re rich."

105
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,460
What’s the difference?

106
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,610
"They’re rich" is a fact.

107
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,760
We know they’re rich.

108
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:25,520
Maybe you’re their accountant, and you know
all about their financial situation.

109
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,190
Maybe they told you how much money they have
directly.

110
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:34,499
Anyway, however you know, you know they’re
rich.

111
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:38,490
"They must be rich" is a deduction.

112
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,710
You don’t actually know they’re rich.

113
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:47,050
You know something else; you know that they
have a huge house and this makes you sure

114
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,000
that they’re rich.

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,059
Okay, let’s look at another example:

116
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:59,590
"It must be a difficult exam—only 10% of
candidates pass."

117
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,779
Again, using 'must' expresses a deduction.

118
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,699
If you say this, you haven’t actually taken
the exam.

119
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:11,669
You don’t know for yourself that it’s
difficult.

120
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:19,669
However, you do know something else: you know
that only 10% of candidates pass, and this

121
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:24,409
makes you sure that it’s a difficult exam.

122
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:25,900
In our last example:

123
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,770
"It must have rained last night."

124
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,490
Did you see it rain?

125
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,240
No, you didn’t.

126
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,479
But, you’re sure it rained.

127
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,479
How?

128
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,909
Probably, you can see that the ground is wet.

129
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:46,790
You didn’t see or hear the rain, but you
can make a deduction from what you see.

130
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,440
What you see makes you sure that it rained
last night.

131
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,440
You can also use 'must not' with this meaning,
but you can’t use the short form 'mustn’t'

132
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,980
in standard English to express the idea of
deduction.

133
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,660
'Mustn’t' is only used to say that something
is forbidden.

134
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:09,230
Okay, that's a strange point, so let's look
at our next topic, which is negatives--part

135
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,230
five.

136
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,980
It’s important to remember that when you
use 'must' with different meanings, the negative

137
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,760
(or opposite) word is also different.

138
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,100
Okay, let's look at this.

139
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:29,270
So, if 'must' is used for obligation, the
opposite would be 'mustn't', or maybe 'can't'.

140
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:35,500
The opposite of 'mustn't' for prohibition
would be 'must' or maybe 'have to'.

141
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,580
The opposite of 'must' for strong advice is
'shouldn't'.

142
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,470
And for making deductions, the opposite of
'must' would be 'can't', 'couldn't', or maybe

143
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,300
'must not'.

144
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,560
For example:

145
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,060
"Passengers must place bags above the seats."

146
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,480
Here, 'must' expresses an obligation.

147
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,310
The opposite would be:

148
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,190
"Passengers must not place their bags above
the seats."

149
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:08,089
Or, if you wanted to explain this rule in
spoken English, you might say:

150
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:12,230
"You can’t put your bag above your seat."

151
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,230
Another example:

152
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,230
"You mustn’t say anything to her."

153
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,730
Here, 'must' expresses prohibition.

154
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,910
The opposite is:

155
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,660
"You must say something to her."

156
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,680
Or:

157
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,370
"You have to say something to her."

158
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,570
Finally, if you say:

159
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,190
"He must be awake.

160
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,800
It’s two o’clock in the afternoon!"

161
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,410
Here, 'must' expresses a deduction.

162
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,779
The opposite could be:

163
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:42,860
"He can’t be awake.

164
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,310
He never gets up before the late afternoon."

165
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,410
Or perhaps:

166
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,440
"He must not be awake.

167
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,620
He never wakes up early."

168
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,550
It’s important to remember that these opposites
are not all the same!

169
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:04,180
For example, if you use 'must' to express
prohibition, the possible opposites are 'must'

170
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,920
and 'have to'.

171
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,019
This doesn’t mean 'must' and 'have to' have
the same meaning.

172
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,410
Modal verbs are complicated.

173
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:16,270
For now, you need to remember one important
point:

174
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,380
Different meanings of 'must' have different
negatives.

175
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,560
OK?

176
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,740
Good!

177
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,329
Let’s look at one more point.

178
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:28,180
Part six: past forms.

179
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,930
Like with negatives, if you want to use must
to talk about the past, the past form depends

180
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,360
on the meaning of 'must'.

181
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,579
Often, you need to use a different verb.

182
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:41,779
Take a look:

183
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:49,019
So, 'must' for obligation, the past form is
'have to'.

184
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,759
'Mustn't' for prohibition, the past form is
'couldn't'.

185
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:58,990
'Must' for strong advice or recommendations,
the past form is 'should have'.

186
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:04,160
And for making deductions, the past form is
'must have'.

187
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,710
Using 'must' with a past meaning is only possible
if you are using 'must' to make deductions.

188
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:14,480
In all other cases, you need to use a different
verb to talk about the past.

189
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,550
Let’s look at some examples:

190
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,380
"We must be there at 9.00 tomorrow."

191
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,500
This is an obligation.

192
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,170
In the past, you'd say, "We had to be there
at 9.00 yesterday."

193
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,779
"We mustn’t smoke in the restaurant."

194
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:33,170
That's prohibition.

195
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,190
The past: "We couldn’t smoke in the restaurant."

196
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:42,250
"You must try the stew—it’s delicious!"

197
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,560
This is advice.

198
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,120
The past form: "You should have tried the
stew—it was delicious!"

199
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,500
"They must be on the subway—I can’t get
through on the phone."

200
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,029
That's a deduction.

201
00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:00,930
The past form: "They must have been on the
subway—I couldn’t get through on the phone."

202
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,550
You can see how you need to use different
verbs to talk about the past, depending on

203
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,160
the meaning of 'must'.

204
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,310
Okay, finally, let's do a review.

205
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,520
Let’s review what we’ve studied in this
lesson.

206
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,790
'Must' can be used to express obligation and
prohibition, to give strong advice, and to

207
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,050
make deductions.

208
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,030
In some cases, 'must' is similar to other
verbs.

209
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:32,089
For example, 'must' used to express prohibition
is similar to 'can’t'.

210
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:35,860
However, remember that similar does not mean
the same!

211
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:43,410
'Must' is unique, and no verb is ever exactly
the same as 'must'.

212
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,490
Different meanings of 'must' have different
negative and past forms.

213
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:53,000
In other words, the way you use 'must' depends
on the meaning of 'must'.

214
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,330
You can’t just use 'must' in the same way
in every sentence; you need to think about

215
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,740
what 'must' means in each case.

216
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,370
