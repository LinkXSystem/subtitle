00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:02,620
Hi, I’m Kasia.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,940
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,920
This is a ‘5 levels’ lesson.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,760
The lesson has five parts.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,000
Each section will give you a challenge.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Each section is designed to be more difficult
than the previous ones.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,600
You’ll probably find different parts easier
or more difficult.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,779
This will help you to understand where you
have problems; in each section, we’ll give

9
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:34,499
you an idea of what you need to know in order
to understand the challenge fully.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,640
Level one is beginner, so if you’re not
a beginner, you should skip to level two.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,600
Ready?

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,480
Let’s go!

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,620
Look at five sentences.

14
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,239
Complete each sentence with either ‘to’
or ‘for’.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Pause the video and do it now!

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,400
Ready?

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,679
Let’s look at the answers.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,220
‘To’ and ‘for’ both have many different
uses in English.

19
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,659
Some are simple.

20
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,840
You use ‘to’ to talk about going somewhere.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:23,100
For example ‘go to the shop’, ‘go to
London’, ‘go to China’, and so on.

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,980
There’s one common exception: you say ‘go
home’, without ‘to’.

23
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,039
Use ‘for’ when you do something for someone
else.

24
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:40,969
For example, you can hold something for someone,
carry something for someone, buy something

25
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:44,119
for someone, and so on.

26
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:51,460
Use ‘to’ when you’re talking about an
end point in time or space.

27
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,000
In these cases, you often use ‘from… to…’

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,700
For example ‘I’ll be here from Monday
to Friday.’

29
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,960
‘The new road runs from the capital city
to the south coast.’

30
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:14,790
You can also use ‘to’ with verbs of giving,
like in sentence four.

31
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:20,470
However, with these verbs, it’s common to
use a structure without ‘to’.

32
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:29,770
For example, with ‘give’, you can give
someone something, or give something to someone.

33
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,040
Both structures are possible, but the first
is more common.

34
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,349
So, you can say: ‘Give the bottle to me.’

35
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:45,549
Or: ‘Give me the bottle.’

36
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:49,360
Both are possible, but the second is more
common.

37
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,620
These are some of the most common ways to
use ‘to’ and ‘for’.

38
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:03,340
Let’s move on to level two, where you’ll
see another important use of these two prepositions.

39
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,420
Here are your sentences for level two.

40
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:14,250
In each sentence, you need to choose ‘to’
or ‘for’.

41
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,280
Pause the video, and think about your answers.

42
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,280
Are you ready?

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,930
Here are the answers.

44
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,900
You can use ‘to’ and ‘for’ to give
a reason for doing something, or to explain

45
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,120
the function of something.

46
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,829
In sentences one and two, you’re talking
about your reason for doing something.

47
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:41,160
Why did you stop on the way home?

48
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,640
To get a coffee.

49
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,079
Or, for a coffee.

50
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,940
Look at two more examples: ‘We need to go
to the shop to buy some batteries.’

51
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,900
‘We need to go to the shop for some batteries.’

52
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,360
Again, you’re talking about *why* you’re
going to the shop.

53
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:11,470
In this case, you can use ‘to’ plus an
infinitive verb, or ‘for’ plus a noun.

54
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:17,500
In sentences three and four, you’re talking
about the function of something.

55
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,410
What does this little metal thing do?

56
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,850
It’s used to open bottles, *or* for opening
bottles.

57
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:31,390
Look at two more examples like this: ‘She
developed a tool to analyse data collected

58
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,920
at different times and places.’

59
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:41,640
‘She developed a tool for analysing data
collected at different times and places.’

60
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,220
So, we’re talking about ‘reason’ and
‘function’.

61
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,720
Are these ideas the same?

62
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,940
No – they’re different.

63
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,280
Let’s see how.

64
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,280
‘Reason’ tells you why someone does something.

65
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:05,080
Here, you can use ‘to’ plus an infinitive
or ‘for’ plus a noun.

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,610
*Don’t* use ‘for’ plus an -ing verb.

67
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:16,180
‘Function’ tells you what something is
used for, for example a tool.

68
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:25,970
Here, you can use three structures: ‘to’
plus infinitive verb, ‘for’ plus -ing

69
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,870
or ‘for’ plus noun.

70
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,521
If you’re not sure whether to use ‘to’
or ‘for’ in sentences like this, what

71
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:36,630
can you do?

72
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:42,520
If you’re not sure whether a sentence is
about reason or function, then try to use

73
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,580
‘to’ plus infinitive if you can, because
you can use this in both cases.

74
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,310
Review this section if you need to, and think
more about the difference between reason and

75
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,310
function.

76
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:02,050
It’s a common mistake to use ‘for’ plus
-ing when talking about reason, for example

77
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,680
‘We stopped on the way home for getting
a coffee.’

78
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,220
Remember, this is not correct!

79
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,460
But, it’s a common mistake.

80
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,350
Let’s move on to level three, where you’ll
see more mistakes which English learners often

81
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:23,090
make with ‘to’ and ‘for’.

82
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,030
Level three is a little different.

83
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,380
Four sentences are incorrect; only one is
correct.

84
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,920
You have two jobs.

85
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,810
First, find the correct sentence.

86
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,090
Second, correct the mistakes in the other
four sentences.

87
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,690
Got it?

88
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,860
Pause the video, and find your answers.

89
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,680
Take as long as you need!

90
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,180
Could you do it?

91
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,660
Which sentence do you think is correct?

92
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,140
Let’s see.

93
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:06,880
‘To’ and ‘for’ are used after many
verbs, adjectives and nouns.

94
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,560
Many of these are fixed phrases, meaning you
just need to remember them as you learn.

95
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,890
‘Good for your health’ is one expression
like this.

96
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:25,920
You can also say ‘good for you’, which
has the same meaning, and is more natural-sounding,

97
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,570
especially in conversational English.

98
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:36,270
So, you could say ‘Jogging two or three
times a week is good for you.’

99
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:42,660
There are some verbs like ‘phone’, ‘call’,
‘ask’ or ‘answer’ which are used with

100
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:51,340
‘to’ or a similar idea in many other languages,
but not in English.

101
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,590
Is this true for your language?

102
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,950
Do you say ‘phone to someone’ or ‘phone
someone?’

103
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:05,670
If in your language, you say ‘phone to someone’,
you need to be careful with mistakes like

104
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,490
in sentence two!

105
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:17,300
In English, you phone *someone*, call *someone*,
ask *someone* and answer *someone*, without

106
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,720
‘to’.

107
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,000
What about sentence three?

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,290
You heard about this in level two.

109
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:29,280
This sentence expresses reason – why did
you go to the post office?

110
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,620
To express reason, don’t use ‘for’ plus
an -ing verb.

111
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,879
Here, because there’s a verb – ‘send’
– you need to use ‘to’ plus an infinitive

112
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,400
verb.

113
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,839
Sentence four has the same problem.

114
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,919
You’re talking about reason – why are
you taking a break? – and there’s a verb

115
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,919
– ‘eat’.

116
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,180
So, you can only use ‘to’ plus infinitive.

117
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,260
Sentence five is correct.

118
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,480
Do you find it strange?

119
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,800
Normally, you use ‘to’ to talk about the
destination, or end point of a journey.

120
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:13,360
However, with verbs like ‘leave’, ‘depart’
or ‘set out’, you use ‘for’ instead.

121
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,420
Remember: there’s a lot of information and
different topics in this lesson.

122
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:24,980
If you want more examples, go to a good online
dictionary; we recommend Lexico, which you

123
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,810
can find at www dot lexico dot com.

124
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:36,380
Look up ‘to’ or ‘for’ and you can
find many examples of the different ways to

125
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,160
use these two prepositions.

126
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,040
This time, there are two gaps in each sentence.

127
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:50,160
Put either ‘to’ or ‘for’ in each gap.

128
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,400
Do you have the answers?

129
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,820
No?

130
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:55,920
Pause the video and think about your answers!

131
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,200
Don’t just wait for us to tell you!

132
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,780
Ready now?

133
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,430
OK, here are the answers.

134
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:12,560
With some verbs, nouns and adjectives, it’s
possible to use *either* ‘to’ or ‘for’

135
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,350
to express different ideas.

136
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:23,029
This means you can sometimes use *both* ‘to’
and ‘for’ after a verb, such as ‘wait’.

137
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:31,430
You can wait for something, wait for someone,
or wait to do something.

138
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:40,110
If you combine these, you can also wait *for*
something *to* happen, or wait *for* someone

139
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,320
*to* do something.

140
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,730
While it’s possible to use both ‘to’
and ‘for’ here, and with other words too,

141
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,310
the order is not flexible.

142
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,620
You wait *for* someone *to do* something.

143
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,860
You can’t put the ‘to’ phrase before
the ‘for’ phrase.

144
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,779
In sentence two, you *could* change the order
of the ‘to’ and ‘for’ phrases, but

145
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,850
in the other four sentences, you can’t.

146
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:15,280
In such cases, you need to learn the exact
patterns which can follow each verb, noun

147
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:23,230
or adjective: for example ‘apologise to
someone’, ‘apologise for something’

148
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,920
and ‘apologise to someone for something’.

149
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,870
This is more of a vocabulary problem than
a grammar one.

150
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:37,000
If you have problems with this, then learning
grammar rules isn’t the best solution.

151
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,540
Learn and practise specific phrases, and try
to use them in natural speech or writing,

152
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:50,070
like you would with other new vocabulary.

153
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,389
Are you ready for the toughest challenge?

154
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:59,759
Let’s see the sentences
Each sentence has three spaces.

155
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,180
In each space, you can put ‘to’, ‘for’
or nothing.

156
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,579
You should put ‘to’ or ‘for’ if possible.

157
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:13,700
Pause the video and think about your answers
now.

158
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:21,200
We tried to make these sentences as challenging
as we could, so take your time!

159
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,380
Ready?

160
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,510
Let’s look together.

161
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:30,309
In this lesson, you’ve seen different ways
to use ‘to’ and ‘for’.

162
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:35,399
There are other meanings of ‘to’ and ‘for’
which we haven’t covered.

163
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:41,510
Here’s a test: can you remember three different
ways to use ‘to’ and three different ways

164
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,370
to use ‘for’?

165
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:49,269
Pause the video for a few seconds and think
about it.

166
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,630
Could you do it?

167
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,639
If not, don’t worry.

168
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,380
You don’t need to memorise every single
way to use ‘to’ and ‘for’.

169
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:03,740
However, you should understand that if you’re
asking questions like ‘how do I use ‘to’

170
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:10,410
and ‘for’’? or ‘what’s the difference
between ‘to’ and ‘for’’? then you’re

171
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,059
not asking one question.

172
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:19,850
There are many ways to use ‘to’ and ‘for’,
and many differences between them.

173
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,209
In level five, you needed to combine different
uses of ‘to’ and ‘for’ in a single

174
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:26,209
sentence.

175
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:31,279
This is common in real-world English use;
you may need to use ‘to’ and/or ‘for’

176
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,500
in different ways in the same sentence.

177
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,100
This is where things get complicated.

178
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,080
So, what can you do?

179
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,860
Here are two tips.

180
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:49,121
One: learn about using ‘to’ and ‘for’
to talk about purpose and function, which

181
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:52,230
we covered in levels two and three.

182
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,690
This causes the most problems for English
learners.

183
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:02,579
Two: if you find it difficult to use ‘to’
and ‘for’, try to find the reason why.

184
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:06,700
Which meaning of ‘to’ or ‘for’ is
giving you problems?

185
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,220
Do you just need to learn more fixed phrases
using ‘to’ and ‘for’?

186
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,699
Are you having problems because you’re trying
to translate a structure from your language

187
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,440
directly into English?

188
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,380
Remember that English might use different
structures to your native language.

189
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:29,720
Before we finish, a question: what difficulties
do you have with ‘to’ and ‘for’?

190
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,709
Can you think of any other common ways to
use ‘to’ and ‘for’ that we haven’t

191
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:36,180
mentioned in this video?

192
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,300
That’s it.

193
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,940
Thanks for watching!

194
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:40,110
See you next time!
