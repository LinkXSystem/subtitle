00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,010
Hi, I’m Stephanie.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,509
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:09,510
In this lesson, you can learn about English
modal verbs.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,250
What are modal verbs?

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,250
What do they do?

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,570
Why do you need them?

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,670
You’ll see answers to all these questions
in this class.

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,980
Before we start, you should check out our
website: Oxford Online English dot com.

whatever else you want!

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,580
Let’s get back to our topic with some basic
points you should know to use modal verbs

13
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,899
correctly.

14
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,120
Shall we start?

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,659
Yeah, we probably should!

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,160
So, can you tell me something about modal
verbs?

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,020
Sure.

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,420
What would you like to know?

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,639
I must know everything about them!

20
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:54,499
That might take a long time!

21
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:56,789
You’ll help me, though, right?

22
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,510
Of course, even though it may be challenging.

23
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,489
There are nine modal verbs in English.

24
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:06,420
You just heard a dialogue with nine lines.

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,869
Each line contains one modal verb.

26
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,890
Can you name the nine modal verbs in English?

27
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:18,890
Maybe you know them already, but if not, you
can go back and try to find them in the dialogue.

28
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:30,060
The nine modal verbs are: can, could, may,
might, will, would, shall, should and must.

29
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,240
What do modal verbs do, and how are they different
from other verbs?

30
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,430
Also, why are they so important?

31
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,820
Modal verbs add information to other verbs.

32
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,030
That’s their job.

33
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,190
They can add ideas like possibility, uncertainty,
or obligation to another verb.

34
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,530
Grammatically, modal verbs follow their own
rules.

35
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,700
Let’s see what this means.

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,420
Rule number one: a modal verb is followed
by an infinitive verb, without ‘to’.

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,140
For example: ‘She can speak fluent Spanish.’

38
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,720
‘We shouldn’t do anything until we know
more.’

39
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,660
‘They won’t be here before ten.’

40
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,220
You can’t put a noun after a modal verb,
or an -ing verb, or anything else, only an

41
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,530
infinitive verb without ‘to’.

42
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,120
Rule number two: modal verbs can’t be used
in different times or tenses.

43
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,980
Modal verbs don’t have past, perfect or
future tenses like regular verbs do.

44
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,600
There are some cases where this isn’t 100%
true.

45
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,470
For example, ‘could’ is the past tense
of ‘can’ in some cases.

46
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,700
‘Would’ sometimes acts like a past version
of ‘will’.

47
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,150
However, ‘could’ can also have a present
or future meaning.

48
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,270
It’s better to think about each modal verb
individually.

49
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,230
Rule number three: modal verbs are *auxiliary*
verbs.

50
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,010
That means you make negatives by adding ‘not’
to the end of the verb.

51
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,230
For example: can, can’t.

52
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,200
Would, wouldn’t.

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,640
Might, might not.

54
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,060
Negative modal verbs are often contracted,
although ‘might not’ and ‘may not’

55
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,220
are usually written fully, without contractions.

56
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:25,780
For ‘will’ and ‘shall’, the spelling
changes in the negative: will, won’t; shall,

57
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,700
shan’t.

58
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,800
To make a question, move the modal verb before
the subject.

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,560
For example: ‘Should I tell him?’

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,920
‘What would you do?’

61
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,560
What about the other question: why are modal
verbs important?

62
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,000
Modal verbs can express many basic concepts
which you will need regularly, in any situation.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,460
Modal verbs are used to express obligation,
give advice, talk about possibility and probability,

64
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,220
ask for permission, and more.

65
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:07,400
Next, let’s look at the meanings which modal
verbs can express in more detail.

66
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,360
Can I ask you something?

67
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,400
Sure.

68
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,600
I’m thinking I might ask for a transfer
to the Singapore office.

69
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,730
I’ve always wanted to live abroad, and I
think now’s the right time.

70
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,730
What do you think?

71
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,670
I think if you’ve thought about it, then
you should try it.

72
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,780
Better to regret something you did than something
you didn’t do; that’s my view.

73
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,680
Hmm…

74
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,220
Will they agree, though?

75
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,640
You don’t know till you ask!

76
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,930
Anyway, I’m sure they’ll agree; you have
a good track record here, and if you come

77
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,920
back later you’ll have a lot of valuable
experience.

78
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,450
So, they should say yes.

79
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,130
I’m just worried, because I know that Olga
asked for a transfer to Canada, and they wouldn’t

80
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,130
let her…

81
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,360
That’s a totally different situation.

82
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,220
Olga’s a tax specialist; she’s irreplaceable.

83
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,230
I wanted to ask one more thing: will you write
a reference for me?

84
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,230
No problem!

85
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,620
I’d be happy to.

86
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,310
There’s one more thing you must do before
you apply.

87
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,590
What’s that?

88
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,420
Talk to the Singapore office.

89
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,260
I can put you in contact if you need.

90
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,290
That’s great!

91
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,610
Thanks so much for helping me out.

92
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,440
You can use modal verbs to express nine fundamental
ideas.

93
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,700
Maybe you’re thinking: “That’s nice
and easy!

94
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:22,410
There are nine modal verbs, and nine meanings,
so each verb must have one meaning, right?”

95
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,410
Nope!

96
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,590
Unfortunately, it’s more complicated than
that.

97
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,540
First, the nine meanings are broad.

98
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,510
Each contains several smaller ideas.

99
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,860
Secondly, every modal verb can have more than
one meaning.

100
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,070
Anyway, we’ll worry about that later!

101
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:46,220
For now, let’s look at the nine fundamental
ideas which modal verbs can express.

102
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,640
Asking permission.

103
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,660
Expressing possibility or impossibility, when
you think something could be true or not.

104
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,980
Giving advice or suggestions.

105
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:06,160
Expressing certainty or uncertainty, when
you’re sure something is true or not.

106
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,940
Expressing probability, when you think one
result is more likely than another

107
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,140
Expressing willingness or refusal, for example
when someone lets or doesn’t let someone

108
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,780
else do something.

109
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,520
Making a request or an offer.

110
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,480
Expressing an obligation, when it’s necessary
to do something.

111
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Expressing ability, when someone has the capacity
to do something, or not.

112
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,680
In the dialogue, there’s at least one example
of each of these nine basic meanings.

113
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,110
Can you find them?

114
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,140
If you want a challenge, go back and listen
to the dialogue again.

115
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:52,200
Try to find one sentence with a modal verb
which expresses each of the nine basic meanings.

116
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,820
Let’s look together.

117
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,360
Here are nine sentences from the dialogue.

118
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,860
The first sentence is asking permission.

119
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,220
You use ‘can’ to ask ‘Is this OK?’

120
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,060
Sentence two is talking about possibility.

121
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,400
You’re saying that something is possible,
but not certain.

122
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,000
The third sentence is giving advice.

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,780
Number four is expressing certainty.

124
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,990
You’re sure that something is true now,
or that something will happen in the future.

125
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,449
In case you’re wondering, possibility and
certainty are closely related.

126
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:35,040
We’re separating them, but you could also
see them as two sides of the same idea.

127
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,650
However, probability, as in sentence five,
is different.

128
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:46,500
Here’s a question: what’s the difference
between probability and possibility?

129
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,280
Probability has different levels.

130
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,880
Something can be 90% probable, or 50% or 20%,
or whatever.

131
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,620
Possibility is binary: either something is
possible, or it isn’t.

132
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,660
It doesn’t make sense to say that something
is 50% possible.

133
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:10,070
This might sound abstract, but it’s relevant
to using modal verbs.

134
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,570
Here, ‘should’ expresses probability.

135
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:19,000
The sentence ‘They should say yes’ means
that it’s more likely they’ll say ‘yes’

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,160
than ‘no’.

137
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,020
The sixth sentence expresses refusal.

138
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:29,479
‘Wouldn’t’ here has a similar meaning
to ‘refused to’.

139
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:35,080
Number seven is a request, when you ask someone
to do something for you.

140
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,020
The eighth sentence expresses an obligation.

141
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,820
‘Must’ here means that it’s necessary
to do something.

142
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,600
Finally, the ninth sentence expresses ability.

143
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,440
So, there’s a lot of information here!

144
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,699
What should you take away?

145
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,660
Let’s look at two key points.

146
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,420
First, not every modal verb was used in these
nine sentences.

147
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,379
There’s no ‘could’, no ‘shall’ and
no ‘may’.

148
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:05,829
What does this tell you?

149
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:11,750
It shows you what we told you before: every
modal verb can have more than one meaning.

150
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:18,040
Also, it shows you that every idea, like obligation,
certainty, and so on, can be expressed by

151
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,319
more than one modal verb.

152
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:26,329
Let’s look at this point in more detail.

153
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:27,930
Can you look at something for me?

154
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,420
Sure.

155
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,160
What’s up?

156
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,360
It’s my laptop.

157
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,279
It’s acting weirdly.

158
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,269
I know you’re good with these things, so…

159
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,930
What’s the problem exactly?

160
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,220
It keeps freezing, and I can’t do anything
for a while.

161
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,440
Sometimes it’s just a few seconds, but sometimes
it goes on for half an hour.

162
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,380
It’s really annoying!

163
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,620
Older laptops can get like that sometimes.

164
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,459
But I only bought it six months ago!

165
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,170
Do you have an antivirus program?

166
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,660
Yes, and I do scans regularly.

167
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,050
It can’t be a virus.

168
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,949
I’m not so good with technology, but I am
pretty security conscious.

169
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:00,949
Hmm…

170
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:03,369
That’s probably not the problem, then.

171
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,959
Can I take it for an hour or so?

172
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,310
I’ll need your login password, too.

173
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,300
That way I can take a proper look.

174
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,399
OK, here.

175
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,589
Thank you so much!

176
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:18,149
In this dialogue, there were five different
sentences using the modal verb ‘can’.

177
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:21,080
Do you remember them?

178
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,040
Here they are.

179
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,200
In each sentence, ‘can’ has a different
meaning.

180
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,760
Think about the nine basic meanings of modal
verbs, which you saw in section two.

181
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:36,379
Can you explain the meaning of ‘can’ in
each of these sentences?

182
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,800
Can you see how they’re different?

183
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,360
‘Can you look at something for me?’ is
a request.

184
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,940
‘I can’t do anything for a while’ expresses
ability.

185
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,600
‘Older laptops can get like that sometimes’
expresses a general possibility.

186
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,400
It’s like saying ‘It’s common for older
laptops to get like that.’

187
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,490
‘It can’t be a virus’ expresses certainty.

188
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,980
It’s like saying ‘I’m sure it isn’t
a virus.’

189
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:15,379
‘Can I take it for an hour or so?’ is
asking permission to do something.

190
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:17,620
This is just one modal verb.

191
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,750
‘Can’ is an extreme example, because most
modal verbs don’t have five different meanings.

192
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:28,440
Actually, ‘can’ has a sixth meaning—it
can be used to make an offer, as in ‘Can

193
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,960
I help you with anything?’

194
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,290
However, every modal verb has at least two
different meanings, and most have three or

195
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,290
four.

196
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,069
So, what’s the point here?

197
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:45,379
Point one: *really* don’t try to understand
modal verbs by translating them into your

198
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:46,749
language.

199
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:52,019
Of course, this is true generally, but it’s
especially important with modal verbs, because

200
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,089
they don’t translate cleanly between languages.

201
00:11:55,089 --> 00:12:00,930
If you think that ‘can’ in English translates
to one verb in your language, you’ll create

202
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,940
problems for yourself.

203
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,920
Point two: to understand a modal verb in a
sentence, you need to understand the context.

204
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:14,339
Again, this is general advice, but again it’s
especially important with modal verbs.

205
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:19,400
The meaning of a modal verb can be completely
different in different contexts.

206
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,749
Point three: the different meanings of a modal
verb are unconnected.

207
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:30,740
Look at two sentences with ‘must’: ‘It
must be late—it’s dark outside.’

208
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,160
‘You must read this article.

209
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,199
It’s so interesting!’

210
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:40,620
What does ‘must’ mean in these two sentences?

211
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,400
In the first sentence, ‘must’ expresses
certainty.

212
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,160
You’re saying ‘I’m sure it’s late,
because it’s dark outside.’

213
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,129
In the second sentence, ‘must’ expresses
strong advice.

214
00:12:56,129 --> 00:13:02,449
Most English learners will first learn ‘must’
to express obligation, in sentences like ‘Employees

215
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,320
must keep records of all expenses.’

216
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,980
Often, they’ll think about ‘must’ by
translating it into their language.

217
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:16,149
Then, when they see the word ‘must’, they
think about the verb in their language.

218
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:21,300
If you do this, you might think that other
meanings of ‘must’ are somehow connected

219
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,279
to the idea of obligation, or whatever you
learned first.

220
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,620
But, there’s no connection.

221
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,740
It’s just coincidence that you use the word
‘must’ in these three sentences.

222
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,940
The meaning is completely different in each
case.

223
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,060
There’s no connection except that the word
is the same.

224
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:47,720
Now, let’s look at one more thing you should
know about modal verbs.

225
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,149
What time are we supposed to be there?

226
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:54,110
Ten, I think, but I think we ought to aim
to arrive at least fifteen minutes before.

227
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,440
So, that means we have to leave here at…
what?

228
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,320
Nine?

229
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,720
We’d better leave earlier, I think.

230
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,920
There’s a metro strike tomorrow, so the
traffic will be terrible.

231
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,500
Are we going to drive, or take a taxi?

232
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,900
I’m not sure we’ll be able to find a taxi,
so I think driving is best.

233
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,720
In the dialogue, you heard several examples
of semi-modal verbs.

234
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,079
Do you know what these are?

235
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,100
Here are the sentences you heard.

236
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,260
So, what are semi-modal verbs?

237
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,400
Semi-modals have some of the features of modal
verbs, but not all.

238
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,460
Most importantly, semi-modal verbs do the
same thing as modal verbs.

239
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,579
They add information to other verbs.

240
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:44,619
They can express many of the same ideas, like
obligation or giving advice.

241
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:48,879
They don’t follow all the grammar rules
of regular modal verbs.

242
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,470
For example, ‘have to’ is a semi-modal,
and you can use it in different tenses: it

243
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:59,420
has a past tense, ‘had to’; you can use
it in the present perfect, ‘I have had to…’

244
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,350
and so on.

245
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,350
Often, modals and semi-modals can be used
with the same meaning.

246
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,640
Look at two sentences: ‘It’ll rain this
afternoon.’

247
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,420
‘It’s going to rain this afternoon.’

248
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:20,819
Here, you use ‘going to’, which is a semi-modal,
to express certainty, in the same way that

249
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,119
you can use ‘will’.

250
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:26,399
It doesn’t matter which verb you use in
this case.

251
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,019
However, in some cases, semi-modal verbs have
their own specific meaning.

252
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:38,449
For example, ‘supposed to’ is similar
to ‘should’, but not the same.

253
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:43,980
Look at two sentences: ‘We’re supposed
to be there at ten.’

254
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,059
‘We should be there at ten.’

255
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:51,790
The basic meaning is similar, but not the
same.

256
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,959
If you use ‘should’, you’re saying that
*you* think this is important.

257
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:03,020
If you use ‘supposed to’, you mean that
*other people* think that this is important.

258
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,259
‘We’re supposed to be there at ten’,
suggests that someone else has told you to

259
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,280
be there at ten, and maybe it’s not so important
to you.

260
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,360
Maybe you’re thinking at this point: how
many semi-modal verbs are there?

261
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,980
Can you give us a list?

262
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:24,800
Not really, because it’s not entirely clear
what makes something a semi-modal verb.

263
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,220
Many textbooks will say that ‘need’ or
‘dare’ are semi-modals, but they’re

264
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,519
rarely used in this way in modern English.

265
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,459
The most common semi-modals are all in the
dialogue at the beginning of this section.

266
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:43,730
If you understand how to use these six semi-modals,
you are doing well!

267
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:49,230
Finally, a question: which modal verb is most
difficult for you to understand and use in

268
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,680
English?

269
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,070
Why do you think that is?

270
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,339
Please share your thoughts in the comments!

271
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:56,649
Thanks for watching!

272
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:57,190
See you next time!
