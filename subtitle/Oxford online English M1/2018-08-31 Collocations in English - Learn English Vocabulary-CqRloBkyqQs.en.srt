00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,090
Hi, I’m Kasia.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,580
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,800
In this lesson, you can learn about collocations
in English.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,930
But, what are collocations?

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,170
Why can’t you say, There was hard traffic
on the way to the centre?

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,890
Because of collocation.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,900
Can you say totally exhausted?

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,990
Yes, you can,

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,750
What about totally freezing?

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,230
No, you can’t.

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,820
Why not?

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,820
Collocation!

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,989
Why do you apply for a job, but you apply
to a company?

14
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,249
Can you guess?

15
00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:36,280
Er…

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,179
Of course, the answer is ‘collocation.’

17
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:44,030
But what does this mean?

18
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,690
Collocation means that some words fit together,
and other words don’t.

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,239
Look at a sentence you heard before:

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,949
There was hard traffic on the way to the centre.

21
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,300
Is this correct or not?

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,299
It’s not correct.

23
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:07,350
If you said this, everybody would understand
what you meant, but native English speakers

24
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,710
would never use the words hard traffic together.

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,820
Do you know the correct way to say it?

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,310
You could say heavy traffic, bad traffic,
terrible traffic, and there are other possibilities.

27
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,260
What’s the point here?

28
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,289
The point is that some words fit together,
and some words don’t.

29
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:31,409
There isn’t any logic to it.

30
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,520
This makes collocations difficult.

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,659
If you don’t know that heavy traffic is
the correct collocation, it’s hard to guess.

32
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,689
You either know it, or you don’t.

33
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:49,439
In this lesson, you’ll learn about common
collocations in English, how to learn and

34
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,979
remember collocations, and why you should
focus on collocations as part of your English

35
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,069
study.

36
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:04,369
You almost certainly know many collocations
in English already.

37
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:12,310
The most common collocations in English are
with everyday verbs like do, make, get, give,

38
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,250
have, and so on.

39
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,020
Each of these verbs has tens of possible collocations.

40
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,950
Here’s a challenge for you.

41
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,730
You’re going to hear a dialogue.

42
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,890
In the dialogue, there are ten collocations
with these five verbs.

43
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,690
Listen and write down the ten collocations.

44
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,900
Can you do me a favour?

45
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,700
I’ve just got in!

46
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,380
Can’t I have a break for five minutes?

47
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,900
But I have a big problem!

48
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,600
Amanda’s arriving in fifteen minutes, and
my car won’t start.

49
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,660
Can you give me a lift to the station?

50
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,880
Ok, fine.

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,960
Give me a minute to get ready.

52
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,590
So, where’s Amanda?

53
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,890
Shouldn’t she be here already?

54
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,090
I think I made a mistake…

55
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,090
Oh?

56
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,050
I got confused and mixed up the dates.

57
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,660
She’s coming tomorrow.

58
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,200
Well, at least you already made the beds.

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,430
Can you give me a lift tomorrow?

60
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,900
Please?

61
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,200
Work is busy tomorrow, but I’ll do my best.

62
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,500
How was that?

63
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,090
Could you write down the ten collocations?

64
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,120
If you want, you can go back and listen to
the dialogue a second time.

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,920
Here are the ten collocations you heard:

66
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,480
do someone a favour
do (your) best

67
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,570
make a mistake
make the beds

68
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:43,300
get in
get confused

69
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,100
give someone a lift
give (me) a minute

70
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,970
have a break
have a (big) problem

71
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,250
You can see how common collocations are.

72
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,430
They’re everywhere in spoken English!

73
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,060
All the collocations you saw are based on
verbs.

74
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,310
However, collocations can be based on any
part of speech.

75
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:15,780
For example, there are adjective-noun collocations,
like a great achievement or a long journey.

76
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:23,960
There are adverb-adjective collocations, like
terribly hot or extremely significant.

77
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:31,990
There are noun-noun collocations, like a slice
of cake or a pile of laundry.

78
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,080
There are more.

79
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,030
The point is that collocations are everywhere.

80
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:43,830
To speak English naturally and fluently, you
need to pay attention to them.

81
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,160
So, what should you do?

82
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:55,510
The best way to find and learn collocations
is to do regular reading and listening practice

83
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,240
in English.

84
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,400
As you read or listen, pay attention to collocations.

85
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,630
If you’re reading something, you can try
to underline the collocations you find.

86
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,460
Remember that just because you know the words,
it doesn’t mean you know the collocation!

87
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,790
For example, you might see collocations like:

88
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,240
He went bald when he was in his twenties.

89
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,650
It’s a big decision, but we have to do something.

90
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,900
It was a little expensive, but still good
value.

91
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,900
You might think, “I know the words, so there’s
nothing to learn here,” but this could be

92
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,700
a mistake.

93
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,800
Think about the collocation big decision.

94
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,500
If you don’t know the collocation, you might
say something else, like large decision or

95
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,010
heavy decision.

96
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,420
However, these don’t work.

97
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,330
You need to know the collocation: big decision.

98
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:01,290
The collocation is almost like a separate
word that you need to learn and remember.

99
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,530
Let’s practice!

100
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,990
Look at a short text.

101
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,090
There are ten collocations in the text.

102
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,270
The collocations are of different types.

103
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,310
Can you find the ten collocations?

104
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,620
Pause the video, read the text, and try to
find them.

105
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,419
Start again when you’re ready.

106
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,190
Ready?

107
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,740
Let’s look.

108
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,610
One quick point: maybe some of you have different
answers.

109
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,680
Maybe some of you think there are more than
ten collocations in the text.

110
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
You could be right.

111
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,810
There isn’t a clear line between what is
a collocation and what isn’t.

112
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,940
For example, is very patient a collocation?

113
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,590
You could say that it is, or that it isn’t.

114
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,110
It isn’t clear.

115
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,669
Don’t worry about this point.

116
00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:00,570
It doesn’t make any difference to how you
should study and use collocations.

117
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:06,180
So, now you’ve found ten collocations in
your text.

118
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,200
You could find more collocations using a dictionary.

119
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,780
For example, there are two collocations in
the text with the word friend: become friends

120
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,710
and one of my closest friends.

121
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,610
Can you find two more?

122
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,300
Use your favourite dictionary, preferably
a monolingual dictionary.

123
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,090
Look up the word friend, and write down two
more collocations.

124
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,240
Pause the video and do it now!

125
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,590
Ready?

126
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,190
What did you get?

127
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:49,130
There are many, many possible answers, but
maybe you wrote down something like:

128
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,090
make friends (with someone)
a good friend

129
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:58,710
(your) best friend
Or: a true friend

130
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,520
Let’s do one more.

131
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,050
In the text, you saw the collocation demanding
job.

132
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,580
What else can be demanding?

133
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,760
Pause the video, look up demanding in your
dictionary, and write down two more possible

134
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,500
collocations.

135
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,240
Ready?

136
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,490
What did you get this time?

137
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,030
Here are three suggestions:

138
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,160
a demanding person
a demanding period

139
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,790
a demanding situation

140
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,899
Again, there are other possibilities.

141
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:39,740
So, when you’re reading or listening in
English, try to notice the collocations you

142
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,069
see or hear.

143
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:46,819
You can then use your dictionary to look up
related collocations.

144
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:51,680
However, you’ll very quickly have a lot
of collocations!

145
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,559
How can you remember them all?

146
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:01,850
Learning and remembering collocations is the
same as learning any other vocabulary.

147
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,630
That means you should:

148
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:09,730
One: Learn vocabulary from real-life sources,
for example from reading articles, listening

149
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,680
to songs, or having conversations with your
friends.

150
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,399
Don’t learn vocabulary by making big lists
of words from the dictionary.

151
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,339
Two: learn and review vocabulary in full sentences.

152
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:29,149
If you want to remember the collocation keep
in touch with someone, don’t just write

153
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:34,949
down the phrase; write down a full sentence
which is meaningful for you.

154
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:40,040
For example: I use Whatsapp to keep in touch
with my friends overseas.

155
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,149
Three: you need a system to review vocabulary
regularly.

156
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:50,720
The best way to do this is to use a flashcard
app like Quizlet or Anki.

157
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:57,529
Finally, like any vocabulary, you need to
use it, otherwise it won’t stick in your

158
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:58,610
head.

159
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,170
How can you do that?

160
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:07,369
Here’s one suggestion: when you learn collocations,
put them in groups by topic.

161
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:14,209
For example, collocations to describe a person,
collocations to describe a city, collocations

162
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:17,920
to talk about relationships, and so on.

163
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,429
When you have ten or more collocations in
a group, write a short text, and try to use

164
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:27,899
all of the collocations as you write.

165
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,370
For example, if you’ve found ten collocations
to describe a city, you could write a short

166
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,829
paragraph about your hometown using the collocations
you’ve learned.

167
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:40,769
It might look something like this:

168
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:45,459
Athens is a sprawling city with a rich history.

169
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:51,550
The old centre is full of steep, narrow streets
and archaeological monuments.

170
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,950
It has a lively atmosphere, especially at
night.

171
00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:02,790
You can get around by metro, which is useful
because traffic jams are a constant problem.

172
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:10,019
You can easily find tasty local food in the
centre, although touristy places can be overpriced.

173
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:15,490
There’s very little street crime, so you
don’t have to worry about safety, although

174
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,509
you should look out for pickpockets in the
metro.

175
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:23,439
This can be challenging, but it’s worth
making the effort.

176
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:28,470
By using the collocations you learn to write
something which is true for you, you’ll

177
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,149
be able to remember them more easily.

178
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:40,280
Finally, let’s see how collocations can
be the key to increasing your English vocabulary.

179
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,450
Often, students tell us things like:

180
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,369
I need more vocabulary to speak English.

181
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:49,839
I can’t find the right words when I’m
speaking.

182
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,449
Or: I need to learn more vocabulary for my
IELTS exam.

183
00:11:54,449 --> 00:12:01,120
Or: I want to learn academic vocabulary to
express my ideas clearly.

184
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,230
What if we told you that you could improve
your vocabulary massively, without even learning

185
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,239
any new words?

186
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:10,410
What?

187
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,429
How can that be?

188
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:17,860
It’s not about how many words you know;
it’s about how you use those words.

189
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,829
Remember earlier, you saw the collocation
big decision?

190
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:28,389
Probably, all of you know the words big and
decision, but we’re guessing not all of

191
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:33,170
you knew the collocation big decision.

192
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:37,430
Most of the collocations in this lesson are
probably similar.

193
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:43,600
The individual words might not be new, but
the combination is.

194
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,069
You’ve seen around thirty to forty different
collocations in this lesson.

195
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:53,739
Actually, you’ve seen many more, but we’ve
highlighted that many.

196
00:12:53,739 --> 00:13:00,610
This is a tiny, tiny proportion of the collocations
we could have shown you.

197
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,449
Collocations are everywhere, and many of them
use words you’re already familiar with.

198
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:12,190
So here’s our final piece of advice: spend
more time learning collocations.

199
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:17,379
Don’t just learn single words; learn combinations
and phrases with them.

200
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:21,540
Learn collocations using the vocabulary you
have.

201
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:27,209
Follow the steps in this lesson: find collocations
by reading or listening, use good vocabulary

202
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:33,540
learning practices, and use collocations by
writing short texts on different topics.

203
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:39,929
This way, you can learn to use the vocabulary
you already know to express a wider range

204
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:41,069
of ideas.

205
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:49,019
You’ll be able to talk more fluently and
naturally, and express yourself more clearly.

206
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:56,829
Here’s a question for you: have you found
any weird, funny, interesting or really illogical

207
00:13:56,829 --> 00:13:58,790
English collocations?
