00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,139
Hi, I’m Kasia.

2
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:04,930
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,889
Here’s a question: do you want to improve
your English vocabulary, or learn to understand

4
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,430
native speakers better?

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,450
Of course you do!

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,680
In this lesson, you’ll see a study technique
which can help you to learn English more efficiently,

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,460
and make real, deep progress over time.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,550
You’ll see a mistake which many English
learners make, and how you can avoid it.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,720
Before we start, don’t forget to check out
our website: Oxford Online English dot com.

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,050
Do you need English classes?

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,620
We have many professional English teachers,
with many years of experience, who you can

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,590
study with in online classes.

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,480
Even if you’re not interested in this, you
can also find many free English lessons, including

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,060
videos and listening lessons.

15
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,840
But now, let’s get back to the question
you heard before.

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,630
How can you improve your English over time?

17
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,100
How can you make real progress, so that you
don’t keep forgetting and relearning the

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,070
same things?

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:12,649
The solution is not easy or fast, but it is
simple: read more and listen more in English.

20
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:17,030
Reading and listening in English regularly
are essential if you want to improve your

21
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,340
English skills.

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,810
OK, you say, but what about my speaking?

23
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,880
What about my writing?

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,590
I need to learn to speak in English!

25
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,639
Fine, but where will your vocabulary come
from?

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,800
Where will your sentence structure come from?

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,780
These building blocks of language don’t
come from nowhere.

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,700
They come from things you read or hear.

29
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:47,649
The more you read and listen, the more tools
you’ll have when you’re speaking or writing.

30
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:52,389
But, many English learners don’t read or
listen enough.

31
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:57,279
Sometimes, they say things like: “It’s
too difficult to read in English.”

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,680
“There are too many unknown words!”

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,880
“It’s too tiring!

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,499
I get bored!”

35
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:08,190
You’re going to see an idea to help you
deal with these problems, so you can take

36
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:15,180
control of your study habits, and make real,
deep improvements to your English over time.

37
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,590
When you read or listen, especially in a foreign
language, there are two basic approaches you

38
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,590
can take.

39
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:27,030
Let’s call them “high-intensity practice”
and “low-intensity practice.”

40
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,140
What do we mean here?

41
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,500
High-intensity practice means you give 100%
of your focus.

42
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,390
If you’re reading or listening, you try
to understand as much as you can.

43
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,600
You repeat the same task several times.

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,739
Low-intensity means that you relax.

45
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:47,220
You don’t worry about understanding everything.

46
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,860
You do as much as you want.

47
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,540
So, what’s the big deal?

48
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,840
Why think about this?

49
00:02:55,849 --> 00:03:00,480
To improve, you need to read and listen regularly.

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,870
You also need a balance between high-intensity
and low-intensity practice.

51
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,040
This is where many English learners make mistakes.

52
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,900
They don’t get the balance between these
types of practice right, and this affects

53
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,090
their results.

54
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,769
If you do too much high-intensity practice,
you’ll burn out.

55
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,719
You’ll get tired and bored; you won’t
be able to motivate yourself to study and

56
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,209
practise regularly.

57
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:33,120
Then, you won’t spend enough time practising,
and you’ll struggle to improve.

58
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,920
On the other hand, if all your practice is
low-intensity, you also won’t improve much.

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,209
You won’t learn a lot from your reading
or listening.

60
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:49,250
Again, in the long term, this leads to frustration
and loss of motivation.

61
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,079
In the rest of this lesson, you’ll see how
to apply these ideas to your English reading

62
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,950
and listening practice, and how to find the
right balance between high-intensity and low-intensity

63
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,360
practice.

64
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,800
You’ll also see how to make a sample study
plan to maximise the results you get from

65
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,100
your English study time.

66
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:15,120
First, let’s talk about listening.

67
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,670
Think about four different ways to practice
listening.

68
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,660
One: you watch a film in English, with English
subtitles.

69
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,400
You don’t pause it or check words which
you don’t know.

70
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,110
Two: you watch fifteen minutes of a film in
English, without subtitles.

71
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,570
You pause and rewind to re-listen to sections.

72
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,430
You use a dictionary to check words which
you don’t know.

73
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:46,280
Afterwards, you watch the same section again,
with subtitles, so that you can check what

74
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,720
you heard.

75
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,130
Three: you listen to a podcast or radio station
in English while you’re working, or maybe

76
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,000
while you’re doing some housework.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,140
You’re concentrating on what you’re doing,
so you aren’t really listening most of the

78
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,540
time.

79
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,320
Four: you do an IELTS listening exam.

80
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,140
You check your answers and give yourself a
score.

81
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:17,480
We’ll ask: which are high-intensity and
which are low-intensity ways to practise?

82
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,320
Hopefully, the answer is obvious.

83
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,860
One and three are low-intensity ways to practise;
two and four are high-intensity.

84
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:33,100
When you’re listening to something in English,
what does high-intensity practice mean?

85
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:39,410
It means: you focus 100% on what you’re
listening to, you try to understand as much

86
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,300
as possible, you use a dictionary to check
new words, and you also repeat the same task

87
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,380
at least twice, or possibly more.

88
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,800
High-intensity practice should also include
feedback; you should be able to check if you

89
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,970
understood what you heard correctly or not.

90
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:04,150
In example number two, above, you do this
by rewatching the clip with subtitles.

91
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:09,380
You use the subtitles to check if you heard
everything correctly.

92
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,960
In example number four, you get feedback by
checking your answers against the answer key.

93
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,720
This is a key part of high-intensity listening
practice.

94
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,900
There should always be feedback.

95
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,890
You need a way to check if you heard correctly
or not.

96
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:31,560
There’s one more important difference: high-intensity
practice is time-limited.

97
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,950
You aren’t trying to watch a whole film;
you’re working on a 15-minute clip.

98
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,110
Obviously, IELTS exams are also time-limited.

99
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,700
By contrast, low-intensity practice can go
on for any length of time.

100
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,840
If you’re listening to podcasts while you’re
cleaning your house, you can go on listening

101
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,780
for as long as you want.

102
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,130
What about low-intensity practice?

103
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,470
What does this look like?

104
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,740
Remember the criteria for high-intensity practice.

105
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,100
What were they?

106
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:10,590
100% focus, try to understand as much as possible,
use a dictionary, repeat the same task, and

107
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,400
get feedback.

108
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,510
If you’re not doing these things, then it’s
low-intensity practice.

109
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:23,470
Now, can you think of other examples of high-intensity
listening practice and low-intensity listening

110
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,580
practice?

111
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,880
Remember: both sides are useful!

112
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,280
Pause the video now and think about your ideas.

113
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:39,100
Try to get three methods for high-intensity
practice, and three for low-intensity.

114
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,310
So, what did you get?

115
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,080
There are many possibilities, but here are
three suggestions for high-intensity practice:

116
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,020
One: listen to a song twice, trying to hear
the words.

117
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,440
Then, listen with the lyrics, check any words
you don’t know in a dictionary, then listen

118
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,040
again.

119
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,900
Two: do listening exercises from an English
textbook.

120
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:10,080
Three: do a conversation class with an English
teacher, so you have to understand and respond

121
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,310
to the teacher’s ideas.

122
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,520
What about you?

123
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,550
Did you get similar ideas, or different?

124
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:23,190
By the way, please put your suggestions in
the comments and share them with other learners!

125
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,810
Next, what about low-intensity practice?

126
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,700
Here are three ideas:

127
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:34,830
One: make a playlist of English songs, and
listen to it regularly, for example in your

128
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,560
car, or while you’re on the bus or the subway
going to work.

129
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,890
Two: watch an English TV series with English
subtitles, without worrying about whether

130
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,210
you understand everything or not.

131
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:54,050
Three: listen to English-language radio while
you’re working.

132
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,020
Often, low-intensity practice means you listen
to something in English while you’re doing

133
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,020
something else.

134
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,550
That’s valuable, because you don’t need
to make time for this kind of practice—you

135
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,130
can combine it with other things.

136
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:13,210
Now, you should have some ideas about high-intensity
and low-intensity listening practice.

137
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:18,080
What about reading?

138
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,820
A question: what does high-intensity reading
practice look like?

139
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,530
What about low-intensity reading practice?

140
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:31,840
You can answer this with many of the same
ideas you heard about listening practice.

141
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:37,320
High-intensity reading practice means: you
read everything carefully, you read sentences

142
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,220
and whole texts several times, and you use
a dictionary.

143
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,700
Low-intensity reading practice means you don’t
do these things: you read something once,

144
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:52,440
you don’t worry about unknown words, you
don’t worry about whether you’ve understood

145
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,940
everything or not, and you use a dictionary
little or not at all.

146
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,490
So, is there a difference between high-intensity
and low-intensity practice in reading and

147
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,500
listening?

148
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,590
There are two small differences.

149
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:14,080
First, you need feedback for high-intensity
listening practice, to check if you’ve heard

150
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,420
things correctly or not.

151
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,050
When you’re reading, you can see the words,
so this is less important.

152
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,060
Second, you can do low-intensity listening
practice while you’re doing something else.

153
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,779
You can’t do this with reading.

154
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:33,360
You need to make time for all reading practice,
including low-intensity reading.

155
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,810
Let’s think about another question: should
you choose different things to read for different

156
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:39,960
types of practice?

157
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:45,200
Or, should you read the same things whether
you’re doing high-intensity or low-intensity

158
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,460
training?

159
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,960
What do you think?

160
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,440
Probably, you should read different things.

161
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,550
When you do high-intensity practice, you should
read something that’s challenging, something

162
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,380
right on the edge of what’s possible for
you.

163
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,630
On the other hand, for low-intensity practice,
you should read something that’s relatively

164
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:10,660
easy, so you don’t need to focus too hard.

165
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,660
Want an idea?

166
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,400
Read children’s books, or comic books.

167
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:21,490
A lot of learners we talk to are against this,
because they think it’s childish or unhelpful,

168
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,280
but we disagree!

169
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:30,660
Children’s books can really help your reading,
especially if your English level is lower.

170
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,060
In any case, find something you can read without
much effort, so that you have something you

171
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,260
can use for low-intensity practice.

172
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,420
What about you?

173
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,500
What would you do for high-intensity and low-intensity
reading practice?

174
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,680
Again, please share your ideas in the comments.

175
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,940
Maybe you’ll get some good tips from other
viewers!

176
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:57,420
Next, let’s see how you can use these ideas
to make an effective, realistic study plan

177
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,880
to improve your English.

178
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,310
Let’s start with some basic points.

179
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:09,970
First, you need to make time for high-intensity
listening practice, and both high-intensity

180
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,660
and low-intensity reading practice.

181
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,839
Second, you need to think of ways to get as
much low-intensity listening practice as possible.

182
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,350
Remember that you can do this while you’re
doing something else.

183
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:29,339
Third, you need a good balance of high-intensity
and low-intensity practice.

184
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,220
What does this mean?

185
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:38,779
You need some high-intensity practice, ideally
a little bit every day, but not too much!

186
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:42,870
High-intensity practice is tiring and probably
not fun.

187
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,900
You need to concentrate hard.

188
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,440
It’s work.

189
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,790
So, schedule high-intensity practice for your
best time of day.

190
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,020
Are you a morning person?

191
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,150
Do it as soon as possible after you wake up.

192
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,160
Are you a night owl?

193
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,700
Schedule your practice late in the evening.

194
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,730
Set a time limit for high-intensity practice.

195
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,790
This will help you to focus.

196
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:11,320
Start with fifteen minutes, and then increase
it slowly if you think this is too little.

197
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,500
For low-intensity practice, do as much as
possible.

198
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,529
A good way to do this: take things you do
every day in your language, and replace them

199
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:22,279
with English.

200
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:28,310
For example, do you read the news every day,
maybe while you’re having breakfast?

201
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,030
Read the news in English, instead.

202
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,970
Do you listen to podcasts while you’re walking
around?

203
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,800
Listen to English podcasts, instead.

204
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,220
Remember: low-intensity practice shouldn’t
be stressful.

205
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,430
It shouldn’t be hard to motivate yourself
to do it.

206
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,610
The idea is to expose yourself to as much
English as possible.

207
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,890
That’s it.

208
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,740
Don’t try to do more.

209
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:59,000
Keep high-intensity and low-intensity practice
separate.

210
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,520
Here’s a possible study plan for one day:

211
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,250
High-intensity listening: watch a 5-minute
clip from a TV show, like Friends.

212
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:14,760
Watch once without subtitles, then again with
subtitles, and check any new words in the

213
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
dictionary.

214
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,860
Watch a third time to ‘fix’ the new vocabulary
in your head.

215
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:26,600
Low-intensity listening: put a playlist of
English videos on in the background while

216
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,440
making dinner.

217
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,140
High-intensity reading: read a short news
article on a technical topic.

218
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:39,290
Read once, check new vocabulary, then read
again.

219
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:44,740
Low-intensity reading: browse the comments
under a news article on a topic you’re interested

220
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,640
in.

221
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
What do you think?

222
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,750
Would this be realistic for you?

223
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:55,750
The high-intensity parts here should take
maybe 10-20 minutes each.

224
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,040
The low-intensity reading can take as little
or as long as you want.

225
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,149
That means you need maybe one hour a day total.

226
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:08,520
It also means you don’t need to sit at a
desk and study for hours.

227
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,940
You need to focus for maybe 20 minutes at
a time.

228
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,820
That’s not so bad, right?

229
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,180
Could you do this?

230
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:21,020
If you could follow a study plan like this
regularly, your English will get better over

231
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,540
time.

232
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,870
Of course, you should give yourself different
things to do at least some days, and you probably

233
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,570
won’t be able to do this seven days a week,
365 days a year.

234
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,310
But, maybe you can do it three days a week,
or four.

235
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,620
Maybe even five!

236
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,380
This will still help you.

237
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:47,390
Make a realistic study plan, and don’t get
discouraged if you don’t stick to it perfectly.

238
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:51,649
Do as much as you can, as often as you can.

239
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:52,940
What about you?

240
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,410
Could you make a study plan for yourself using
these ideas?

241
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:02,180
Think about your English level, your interests,
and what’s easy or difficult for you.

242
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,280
If you want, share your daily study plan in
the comments.

243
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:12,220
Sharing your ideas might help other learners,
and you can also get tips from other people!

244
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,220
Thanks for watching!

245
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,470
See you next time!
