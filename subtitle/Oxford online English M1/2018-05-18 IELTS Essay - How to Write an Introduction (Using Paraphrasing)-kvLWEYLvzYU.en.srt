00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,250
Hi, I’m Daniel.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,160
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,430
In this lesson, you can learn about paraphrasing
in IELTS essays.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,990
First question: what’s paraphrasing?

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,699
Paraphrasing means saying the same thing in
a different way.

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,890
But, I’m guessing you already knew that.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,189
Probably, you’re watching this video because
you think you need to paraphrase the question

8
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:28,989
in your IELTS essay introduction, and you
aren’t sure how to do it.

9
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:35,050
We’re making this video because there’s
a lot of bad or inaccurate advice about paraphrasing

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:42,270
around, and many IELTS students have the wrong
idea about what paraphrasing is and how they

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,010
should use it in their IELTS essay.

12
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:50,840
With our IELTS students, we often have to
spend time breaking down bad habits and bad

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,200
ideas which students have about this.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,149
So, in this lesson, you can learn the truth
about paraphrasing in your IELTS essay.

15
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:03,730
You’ll see the number one mistake that IELTS
students make with paraphrasing, and you’ll

16
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,730
learn how to use paraphrase effectively in
your IELTS writing exam.

17
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,340
Let’s start with something that might surprise
you:

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,860
What?

19
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:20,520
But wait, I saw this video, and it said I
should paraphrase the question in my introduction.

20
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:26,670
But wait, I read this article, and it said
I should paraphrase the question in my introduction.

21
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,759
But wait, my teacher told me I should paraphrase
the question in my introduction.

22
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,240
Okay, we know.

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,390
There’s a lot of IELTS advice out there
that says, ‘paraphrase the question in your

24
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,390
introduction.’

25
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,330
Why should you listen when we say you don’t
need to?

26
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:50,369
Don’t pay attention to us; pay attention
to the official IELTS scoring scheme.

27
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,329
To save you time, we’ve added links to the
official scoring scheme under the video.

28
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:57,270
You can read it right now!

29
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:04,619
Go ahead; read the scoring scheme and find
the word ‘paraphrase’.

30
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,659
We can save you some time: it isn’t there.

31
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:12,190
Remember, this is the official scoring system,
which the examiners use to mark your IELTS

32
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,750
writing exam.

33
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,840
The writing mark scheme does not talk about
paraphrase AT ALL.

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,370
Why not?

35
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,790
Because you don’t have to paraphrase the
question in your introduction.

36
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,940
Okay, you think, so how do I start my essay?

37
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,280
Surely paraphrasing the question is better
than nothing?

38
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,500
I don’t know what else to do…

39
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,920
Here’s how a lot of students approach paraphrasing.

40
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,150
See if this looks familiar to you.

41
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,030
Let’s take a question:

42
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:50,500
Robots, computers, and machines are becoming
more advanced, and can perform many jobs which

43
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,500
used to be done by people.

44
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,959
What problems does this cause, and how can
these problems be solved?

45
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,340
So, let’s practice bad paraphrasing!

46
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,590
Let’s see now, we need to change the words.

47
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,330
Let’s find some synonyms:

48
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,450
robot = automaton
advanced = cutting-edge

49
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:23,140
machine = apparatus
job = assignment

50
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,680
people = folks

51
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,069
Wow, great synonyms, right?

52
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:32,549
Let’s plug them into our sentence to create
a bad paraphrase:

53
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:39,060
Automata, computers, and apparatus are becoming
more cutting-edge, and can perform many assignments

54
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,190
which used to be done by folks.

55
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,989
Let’s change a couple of small things so
it’s not so close to the original:

56
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:52,330
Automata, computers, and apparatus are more
and more cutting-edge, and can do many assignments

57
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,540
which were done by folks in the past.

58
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,560
Finished!

59
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,010
What a great paraphrase!

60
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,280
No, no, no!

61
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,069
This is terrible, and it will only hurt your
IELTS score.

62
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:05,760
Don’t do this!

63
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,390
This is what many IELTS students do, but it’s
a bad idea.

64
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,049
Let’s see why this doesn’t work.

65
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:19,240
First, a question: what’s a synonym?

66
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,410
You probably said something like, “a word
with the same meaning as another word.”

67
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,210
That’s more or less true.

68
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:30,360
However, a true synonym is a word which can
replace another word in any sentence.

69
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,890
So, imagine you have two words: A and B.

70
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,810
If word A can be replaced with word B in any
sentence, they’re synonyms.

71
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,850
If word A can be replaced with word B sometimes,
but not always, they’re not true synonyms.

72
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,780
Maybe they have a similar meaning, but they
aren’t the same.

73
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,940
What’s the point of all this?

74
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:56,290
The point is that there are very few true
synonyms in English, or any language.

75
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:03,060
Just because two words have the same meaning
does not mean they can be used in the same

76
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,440
way.

77
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,690
The words people and folks have the same basic
meaning, but that doesn’t mean that you

78
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,780
can say folks any time you say people.

79
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,290
They aren’t true synonyms.

80
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,290
Why not?

81
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:24,140
Because vocabulary usage depends on more than
just meaning.

82
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:29,100
Register and collocation are equally important.

83
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,910
Also, many words which have a similar meaning
don’t have exactly the same meaning.

84
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,970
Machine and apparatus are similar, but they
aren’t the same.

85
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,810
Job and assignment are similar, but they aren’t
the same.

86
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,380
So, that’s problem number one.

87
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,260
When you use words that you think are synonyms,
they probably aren’t true synonyms.

88
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,070
That means you’re changing the meaning—which
is dangerous—and also making language mistakes,

89
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,910
which can hurt your vocabulary score.

90
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:01,930
There’s a second problem: this is a really
weird and unnatural thing to do.

91
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,820
Imagine someone asks you a question.

92
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,820
What do you do?

93
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,210
Do you repeat the question back, using different
words?

94
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,210
Hey!

95
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,190
How was your weekend?

96
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,190
Ah…

97
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,160
You wish to enquire about my recent non-working
days?

98
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,040
How’s the weather in the US?

99
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
So…

100
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,280
You want to know about the climatic conditions
in North America?

101
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,380
No!

102
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,750
This is weird!

103
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,830
When someone asks you a question, you answer
the question.

104
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,340
Your IELTS essay is the same.

105
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,770
The task asks you a question.

106
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,900
Your essay should answer the question.

107
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,530
Your answer starts from your first sentence.

108
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,780
Bad paraphrase adds nothing to your answer.

109
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,570
No paraphrase is better than bad paraphrase.

110
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,340
A bad paraphrase is only an empty sentence
with language mistakes.

111
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,970
That’s all the examiner will see.

112
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,480
For your IELTS score, this is only negative.

113
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,350
Ok, you think, so how do I start my essay?

114
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,360
You have two options, and it depends on your
target score.

115
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,220
Let’s look.

116
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,820
This is going to be a short section.

117
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:22,740
If your target score is 6 or maybe 6.5, and
you don’t know how to start your essay,

118
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,520
here’s what you do:

119
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,740
Write an introduction which is one sentence.

120
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,360
Write a thesis statement.

121
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,180
That means you explain what you’re going
to talk about and what you’re trying to

122
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,020
prove with your essay.

123
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,160
For example:

124
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:47,500
In this essay, I will discuss possible solutions
to the problems caused by robots and computers

125
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,910
taking people’s jobs.

126
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,960
Or: I intend to show that the problems caused
by robots and computers taking people’s

127
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,160
jobs are serious, but also possible to solve.

128
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,720
Or even: Robots and computers are replacing
people at work.

129
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,750
This is a serious problem, and I will discuss
how we can solve it.

130
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,410
That’s all you need.

131
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,290
But, you say, isn’t that too short?

132
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,140
No—not at all.

133
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,280
First of all, your introduction can be any
length.

134
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,540
Your introduction can be one
sentence.

135
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,610
Here’s an important point: your introduction
is the least important part of your IELTS

136
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,210
essay.

137
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,020
Are the example introductions you saw above
great?

138
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,860
No.

139
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,070
They’re not great, but they are easily good
enough.

140
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,260
Your conclusion is super-important.

141
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,820
How you organise your ideas into paragraphs
is very important.

142
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,470
How you support and connect your ideas is
extremely important.

143
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,870
Your introduction is not that important.

144
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,860
You can get a high score with a very basic
introduction.

145
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,330
So, here’s a simple solution: if you don’t
know what to write in your IELTS essay introduction,

146
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,200
don’t write much at all.

147
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,510
Write a short thesis statement, and then start
the body of your essay.

148
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:10,130
This is good advice if your target is 6 or
6.5, but what if you’re aiming for a higher

149
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,380
score?

150
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,260
So, what does effective paraphrase look like?

151
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:23,240
Remember, you’re thinking about writing
a strong IELTS essay here.

152
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,870
That means an essay which scores between seven
and nine.

153
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:34,390
Here’s the thing: when you write a strong
essay, you can’t think about it as lots

154
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,020
of separate things.

155
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:41,410
Lots of IELTS students write essays in this
way: “Ok, first I have to paraphrase the

156
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,500
question, then I need to write a thesis statement.

157
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,530
Ok, first body paragraph: I need a topic sentence,
then a supporting example, then a linking

158
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:55,320
phrase, then a second supporting example…
et cetera.”

159
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,020
That can work for intermediate IELTS scores:
5.5 to 6.5, but it’s not a good approach

160
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,810
for higher scores.

161
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,470
For higher scores, your essay needs to be
one coherent, connected piece.

162
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,560
What does that mean, practically?

163
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,180
And what does it have to do with paraphrasing?

164
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:18,340
First point: your first sentence should be
connected to everything else in your essay.

165
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:25,210
That means you need to know exactly where
your essay is going before you start writing.

166
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:30,140
Before you put one word on the page, you need
to know all the important things you want

167
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,100
to say.

168
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:39,770
Practically, that means you need to know what
your conclusion is going to be before you

169
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,890
start writing.

170
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:48,190
You also need to know exactly how many body
paragraphs you’re going to have, and what

171
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,310
you’re going to put in each one.

172
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:57,230
To be clear, that means when you write your
first sentence, you aren’t just thinking,

173
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,780
“How can I find a synonym for this word?”

174
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,760
Good paraphrasing isn’t about that.

175
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,940
You already know the conclusion you want to
reach, and you know the ideas you want to

176
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,790
discuss.

177
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,850
Effective paraphrasing includes this.

178
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,500
It shows your reader—the examiners—where
your essay is going.

179
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,060
Effective paraphrasing shows how you understand
the key ideas in the question, and what conclusion

180
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,240
your essay is trying to reach.

181
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,930
So, the main point: paraphrasing depends on
planning.

182
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,050
It’s not a simple thing; it’s not just
taking some words and replacing them with

183
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,460
other words—it’s connected to other parts
of your essay.

184
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,680
It’s connected to your ideas and opinions.

185
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,840
If you don’t know the conclusion of your
essay, you can’t write a good introduction.

186
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,640
To write a good introduction, you need to
know exactly where you’re trying to go.

187
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,290
Let’s see how this can work in practice.

188
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:58,550
To paraphrase effectively, you need to take
the ideas in the question and add your own

189
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,550
interpretation.

190
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:05,150
Here’s the question you saw before:
Some questions:

191
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,720
The question talks about robots, computers,
and machines.

192
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,580
What do these words mean in this context?

193
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,420
Can you think of specific examples?

194
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,410
What exactly does advanced mean?

195
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,750
Advanced in what way?

196
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,520
The question mentions jobs which used to be
done by people.

197
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,070
Like what?

198
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,050
The question asks: what problems does this
cause?

199
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,380
Are these problems serious, or not?

200
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,860
Why or why not?

201
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,070
Pause the video and think about these.

202
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:44,430
If you want to write a good introduction,
you need to have clear answers to all of these

203
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,430
questions!

204
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,610
Now, let’s see how you could effectively
paraphrase this question:

205
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:54,600
Advances in technology have led to the automation
of many jobs, especially low-level or manual

206
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,990
positions.

207
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,820
This has led to many serious problems, including
unemployment and increasing rates of poverty

208
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,940
and inequality.

209
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,029
This is what a good paraphrase looks like.

210
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:09,440
Here’s a question: which way do you think
this essay is going?

211
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,310
Do you think the writer will be positive,
negative or neutral about the effects of automation?

212
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,020
It sounds negative.

213
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:23,790
You can guess that the essay will conclude
that automation causes serious problems which

214
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,250
are not easy to solve.

215
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:31,550
Someone who reads the first sentence of your
introduction should be able to do the same

216
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:37,620
thing; they should be able to guess where
your essay is going.

217
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,960
Remember: this starts in your head.

218
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:47,480
Everything needs to be clear in your head
before you write anything.

219
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,660
Another point to notice: our paraphrase doesn’t
have the same sentence structure as the task.

220
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,500
The paraphrase is two sentences, while the
task is just one.

221
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,750
The task asks a question: “What problems
does this cause?”

222
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:06,290
Our paraphrase replaces this with a statement:
“This has led to many serious problems.”

223
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:11,820
Also, our paraphrase replaces general ideas
in the question with more specific ideas.

224
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,480
The question mentions “many jobs,” but
our paraphrase talks about “low-level or

225
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,610
manual positions.”

226
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,860
The question mentions “problems,” but
our paraphrase talks about “serious problems,

227
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,089
including unemployment and inequality.”

228
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:32,290
To review, to write an effective paraphrase,
you need to do three things:

229
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:38,210
One: have a clear plan in your head, with
a clear conclusion, which should be obvious

230
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,610
to your reader from the first sentence of
your essay.

231
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,430
Two: don’t try to stick too closely to the
sentence structure in the question.

232
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,300
Paraphrasing is about ideas, not just words.

233
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:56,310
Three: interpret and develop the ideas in
the task, so that you replace general ideas

234
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,240
in the task with your own more specific ones.

235
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,310
Now, you should understand more about how
to paraphrase in your IELTS essay.
