00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:02,830
Hello, I'm Oli.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,140
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,820
Let me ask you a question: "When is your birthday?"

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,940
This is a simple question, but many English
learners can't answer without making a mistake.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,930
This is because reading dates in English,
saying months and years and dates, is quite

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,220
complicated.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:27,210
In this lesson, we're going to look at how
you can read dates in English.

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,590
Let's start with an example.

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,730
So you see this.

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,170
How can you say it?

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,370
Actually, there are two possibilities.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:42,600
You can say: "November the fourteenth," or:
"The fourteenth of November."

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,039
Let's do one more example.

14
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,449
You see this.

15
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:48,719
How can you say it?

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:57,620
Again, the same two ways: "September the thirtieth,"
or: "The thirtieth of September."

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:05,049
You can see that we don't normally write these
words, 'the' and 'of', but we do say them.

18
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:10,720
You might sometimes hear native speakers read
dates without 'the', especially in American

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,730
English.

20
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,150
If you aren't sure, it's better to use 'the'.

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,600
Next, let's look at years.

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
What about years?

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,880
Let's look at five years and I want you to
think about how you could say them.

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,090
Think about your answers.

25
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:32,730
Pause the video for a moment, and work out
your answers if you aren't sure.

26
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,250
Ok?

27
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,850
Let's look.

28
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:47,870
We say: "Nineteen hundred," "Nineteen oh two,"
"Nineteen eighty," "Two thousand and one,"

29
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,340
"Two thousand and ten," or "Twenty ten."

30
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,180
We need different rules for years before and
after two thousand.

31
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:04,070
So for years before 2000, if the year ends
in '00', use hundreds not thousands.

32
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,020
So say: "nineteen hundred," not "one thousand
nine hundred."

33
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:17,800
If the year ends in '01', '02', '03' etc.,
pronounce 'zero' as 'oh', and don't say hundred.

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:26,200
So we say "nineteen oh one," "eighteen oh
two," "seventeen oh five" and so on.

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,980
If the year ends in a number bigger than ten,
say the year in two parts.

36
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,260
For example: "eighteen twenty," "nineteen
fifty-five," or "nineteen ninety-nine."

37
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,750
For years after 2000, we need different rules.

38
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,700
For the years 2000-2009, use the full number.

39
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,720
"Two thousand," "Two thousand and one," "Two
thousand and two," etc.

40
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:02,750
For the years 2010-2019, you can choose: you
can say the full number - you can say "Two

41
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:09,290
thousand and ten," or you can say the year
in two parts: "Twenty ten."

42
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,099
The same is true for all of these years, so
you can say: "Twenty eleven," or "Two thousand

43
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,099
and eleven."

44
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,340
They're both ok.

45
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:23,709
For 2020 and after, you can still choose to
say the year in two parts, or say the full

46
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,790
number, but saying the year in two parts will
be more common.

47
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:34,980
So "Twenty twenty" will be more common than
"Two thousand and twenty," although both are

48
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,770
ok.

49
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:41,230
Sometimes we shorten dates and use a short
form.

50
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:48,270
For example, we often shorten years from the
recent past by just reading the last two numbers

51
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,960
of the year.

52
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:58,489
For example: you can say "eighty-one" for
1981, like: "My brother was born in eighty-one."

53
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:06,930
2001 could become "oh-one": "I graduated in
oh-one."

54
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:14,709
1999 could be "ninety-nine," like: "She started
working here in ninety-nine."

55
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:20,070
We also sometimes shorten months by using
the number of the month instead of the name.

56
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:27,970
So if your birthday is the 20th of June, 1989,
you could read it as: "Twentieth of the sixth,

57
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,970
eighty-nine."

58
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:34,490
This is very common especially when giving
information on the phone, or in a bank, in

59
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,830
a shop, something like that, people use this
quite often.

60
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,580
Ok, that's the end of the lesson.

61
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,500
I hope it was useful for you.

62
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,560
If you're watching this on YouTube, I suggest
you check out the full lesson on our website.

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,900
The full lesson includes a text and exercises
to help you practise this topic.

64
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,900
But that's all.

65
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,520
Thanks again very much for watching, and I'll
see you next time.

66
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,169
Bye bye!
