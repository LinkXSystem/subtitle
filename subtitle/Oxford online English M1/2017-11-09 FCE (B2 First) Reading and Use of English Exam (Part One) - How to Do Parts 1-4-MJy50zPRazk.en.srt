00:00:01,329 --> 00:00:04,250
Hello, I'm Olivier.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,920
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:14,429
In this lesson, you can learn how to do the
Cambridge FCE reading and use of English exam.

4
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:23,039
The FCE Reading and Use of English exam takes
75 minutes and has seven parts.

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,130
The questions are worth one or two marks each.

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:34,699
This will be a two-part video on the exam,
explaining everything you need to know.

7
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:38,030
Let’s get started!

8
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:45,660
Part one of the test is a short text with
eight gaps that you have to fill.

9
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,430
This is called a cloze test.

10
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:54,410
This one is multiple choice, so for each gap,
you need to choose the correct answer from

11
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,290
four options.

12
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,979
Have a look at this sample question:

13
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:02,750
Biology is a branch of science.

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:11,230
It concerns the natural world, _____ than
chemicals or matter and energy.

15
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:16,280
Now look at the multiple choices for this
question:

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,700
Which answer do you think is correct?

17
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:28,040
Before I tell you, it’s a good idea to look
at the question and see if it gives you any

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,540
clues.

19
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:36,440
You can see that you need a word which goes
with than.

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,000
Only one of these answers will fit.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,540
If you don’t know the answer immediately,
then what should you do?

22
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,490
If you’re not sure, then look carefully
at the answers and eliminate the options that

23
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,490
are definitely not right.

24
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,930
For example, we know the answer can’t be
instead.

25
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,030
Instead of, not instead than.

26
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,220
What about except?

27
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,560
Can you say except than?

28
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,250
No, you can’t.

29
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:23,900
You can say except that, except when, except
if and except for, but you can’t say except

30
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,700
than.

31
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,560
What about sooner than?

32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,280
Is it possible?

33
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,980
Yes: you can say sooner than and rather than.

34
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,220
So how do you know which answer is correct?

35
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:50,280
If both answers are grammatically correct,
then you need to read through the sentence

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,580
with both words to see which one makes logical
sense.

37
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:03,360
We use sooner than as a comparison to say
that something is earlier or faster than something

38
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,819
else.

39
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:12,459
That meaning doesn’t fit here, and so rather
than must be the correct answer.

40
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,880
Did you get it right?

41
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,180
With this part of the test, it’s important
to do a few things:

42
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:26,610
Firstly, look at the words surrounding the
gap to see if they fit with the answer.

43
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:33,200
Are they part of a phrasal verb, idiom or
collocation?

44
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,170
Is there a preposition that will only fit
with certain words?

45
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:45,430
If you’re not sure of the answer, eliminate
ones you know are incorrect to narrow it down

46
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,010
and give you a better chance.

47
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:57,190
Finally, read through the sentence with the
answer to make sure it makes sense!

48
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,709
Sometimes things are grammatically correct,
but they don’t make sense.

49
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:08,550
Let’s move on to part two!

50
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,950
Part two is similar to part one.

51
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:18,870
In this part of the FCE use of English test,
you’ll get a short text with eight gaps.

52
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:25,439
But, to make it harder, there aren’t any
multiple choices in this part.

53
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:32,309
Instead, you have to think of the correct
word and write it in the gap.

54
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:33,650
For example:

55
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:39,909
I have a degree _____ international relations.

56
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:46,129
In this part of the test, the missing word
is also likely to be an article, a preposition,

57
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:53,300
a pronoun, or what I like to call the building
blocks of language.

58
00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:01,220
A common mistake that students make in this
part of the test is using lots of nouns.

59
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:08,380
While it’s true that some answers may be
nouns, it’s more likely you’ll need to

60
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:15,710
use a ‘building block’ word: something
which is needed to make the sentence grammatically

61
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:24,030
complete, rather than something which adds
meaning to the sentence.

62
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:31,419
When you read through your questions, pay attention
to the structure of the sentence and think

63
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:34,529
about what’s missing.

64
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:40,590
It can also be helpful to make notes while
you’re reading the text.

65
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:48,490
For example, if you notice that you need a
preposition in a specific gap, but you aren’t

66
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,590
sure which one yet, make a note next to the
gap.

67
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,050
Are you ready to have a go?

68
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,780
Look at your question:

69
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,300
Do you know what kind of word we need here?

70
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:09,840
We need a preposition, of course. But do you know which preposition?

71
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:20,220
With subjects, like history, English or international
relations, we use the preposition in.

72
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,759
So, the correct answer is:

73
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,419
I have a degree in international relations.

74
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:31,099
Let’s look at another example:

75
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:39,800
People often think my work is very boring,
but ______ from some paperwork, it isn’t

76
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,099
at all!

77
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:48,699
If you read this sentence carefully, it’s
saying that the paperwork is the only boring

78
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,050
thing in the job.

79
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,210
The paperwork is the exception.

80
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:04,249
What are some words or phrases that mean that
something’s an exception?

81
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:11,919
You could say except for, apart from, other
than.

82
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,080
These are the most obvious answers, although
there are other possibilities, too.

83
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,600
Do you know the answer yet?

84
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,680
That’s right, it’s apart.

85
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,929
Apart from means something is an exception,
and apart fits with the preposition from in

86
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:33,479
the sentence.

87
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,580
Now let’s move on to part three!

88
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:46,500
Part three of the FCE reading and use of English
exam is about word formation.

89
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:50,240
Like parts one and two, you need to fill a
gap.

90
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:58,169
However, in part three, you have a stem word
which you need to change to fill the gap.

91
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:04,520
For example, you might see the word LONG as
your stem word.

92
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:12,129
You might need to change the word to length
or longer or longest, depending on the question.

93
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:15,860
Let’s look at your sample question:

94
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:25,740
What most people find difficult with this
curry is how strong and _____ it is.

95
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,240
The stem word with this question is SPICE.

96
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:38,200
It’s a good idea to read through the question
to see what kind of word you need first.

97
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:45,010
Spice can be a noun or a verb—but what do
you need in this question?

98
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,970
Do you need a verb?

99
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,510
If so, what tense?

100
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,850
Do you need an adjective?

101
00:08:52,850 --> 00:09:00,440
If so, do you need a regular adjective, or a
comparative or a superlative?

102
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,910
Let’s look.

103
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:11,540
It refers to the curry, and you can see that
the adjective strong is used to describe it.

104
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:20,770
The gap comes after the words strong and ____,
which suggests that you need another adjective

105
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,440
here.

106
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,910
Do you know what the adjective from spice
is?

107
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,160
The correct answer is spicy.

108
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,010
Let’s do one more example:

109
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:40,890
Unfortunately, these farmers are _____ to
sell their produce.

110
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,180
The stem word is LIKE.

111
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:54,030
Look at the grammatical structure of this
sentence—can you see what’s missing?

112
00:09:54,030 --> 00:10:01,880
The gap is between the verb to be and the
infinitive verb with to, which means that

113
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,380
you need an adjective here.

114
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:12,900
How can you make an adjective from like which
fits this sentence?

115
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:22,090
Likely is an adjective, although it looks
like an adverb, and the meaning fits here:

116
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:28,380
Unfortunately, these farmers are likely to
sell their produce.

117
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,630
But, there’s a problem.

118
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,820
Can you see?

119
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:41,470
Unfortunately refers to something bad, but
farmers selling their produce is not a bad

120
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,080
thing!

121
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,480
Here’s the correct answer:

122
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:52,910
Unfortunately, these farmers are unlikely
to sell their produce.

123
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:59,840
This answer needed a negative prefix for the
sentence to make sense.

124
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:06,940
In the exam, check all of your answers and
make sure the meanings are all correct, as

125
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,980
well as the grammar!

126
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,500
Let’s move on to part four of the exam.

127
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Part four of the FCE reading and use of English
exam has six questions and is called ‘key

128
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
word transformation'.

129
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,780
Let's look at an example.

130
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,480
This is what your question will look like.

131
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:44,060
You’ll be given a sentence, a key word in
capital letters, and then another sentence.

132
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:53,210
The second sentence will only have the beginning
and the end, and you have to complete it.

133
00:11:53,210 --> 00:12:00,070
When you complete the sentence, you need to
use between two and five words, including

134
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,250
the key word.

135
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:08,120
You cannot change the key word in any way.

136
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,680
Let’s get back to our sample question.

137
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,450
Do you know how to answer it?

138
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:25,350
If you’re not sure, here’s a clue: you
need to make a phrasal verb which can be used

139
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,910
with the word instructions.

140
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,490
Any ideas?

141
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,860
You can carry out instructions.

142
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,060
This has a similar meaning to follow instructions.

143
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:45,250
So, the answer to this question would be:

144
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,680
You must carry out the teacher’s instructions
exactly.

145
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,720
Now, it’s time for you to try one:

146
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,980
There are a few clues here to help you.

147
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,880
Can you think of a phrase with point that
means the same as not worth it?

148
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,970
What other important words are missing in
the gap?

149
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,120
Pause the video and try to work out the answer!

150
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,940
I’ll be here to tell you when you press
play again.

151
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,870
Got it?

152
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,140
The answer is:

153
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,600
There is no point in inviting her to the cinema.

154
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,780
She will never come.

155
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:44,520
There’s no point has a very similar meaning
to it’s not worth…

156
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:52,100
There’s no point in doing something is a
fixed phrase, which you need to know to answer

157
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,420
this question.

158
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,920
There’s no other way to use the word point.

159
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,240
There’s only one possible answer.

160
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:10,340
These questions can be worth two points, so
even if you only get half of the answer right,

161
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,120
you can still get one point for that.

162
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:20,480
So, even if you don’t know the full answer,
try to write something.

163
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,790
Now that we’ve reached the end of this video,
you should have a good understanding of the

164
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:33,280
FCE reading and use of English exam parts
one to four, and some ideas on how to prepare

165
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,560
