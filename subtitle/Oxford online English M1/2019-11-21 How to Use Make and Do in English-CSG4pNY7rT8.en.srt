00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,770
Hi, I’m Martin.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,860
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:13,269
In this lesson, you can learn how to use the
verbs ‘make’ and ‘do’ in different

4
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:14,269
ways.

5
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:20,020
You’ll see the differences between ‘make’
and ‘do’, and all the meanings of each

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,020
verb.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:27,340
You’ll also see phrasal verbs and collocations
with ‘make’ and ‘do’.

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,480
Here’s a question: have you visited our
website yet?

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,890
If you want to learn English, we have many
resources to help you, as well as teachers

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,609
you can take online lessons with if you want!

11
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:44,100
Oxford Online English dot com.

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,060
Let's look at our lesson.

13
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:53,580
What's the difference between 'make' and 'do'?

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,620
What are you doing?

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,640
I’m making a shopping list.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,850
I need some stuff to make dinner.

17
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,850
What are you going to make?

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,809
I think some kind of stir-fry.

19
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:05,689
I have to do some work, too, so I need something
quick.

20
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:06,689
Sounds tasty!

21
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,539
Why do you have to work?

22
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:13,469
I have to make a presentation for our meeting
tomorrow, and I need to check through what

23
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:17,109
I’ve written, and maybe change a few things.

24
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:20,149
By the way, can you do the washing-up before
I get back?

25
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:23,420
I’d like to start cooking as soon as I get
in.

26
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,659
I need to do everything and get to bed early.

27
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:28,540
Sure, I’ll do it now.

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:37,780
Here, you saw three ways to use ‘do’ and
three ways to use ‘make’.

29
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,640
Can you remember them?

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,200
Imagine you’re an English teacher.

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:55,899
Could you explain the basic difference between
‘do’ and ‘make’ to someone?

32
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:57,969
How would you do it?

33
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:01,260
Think about it!

34
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,700
‘Do’ means to perform an activity or a
task.

35
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,599
For example, you do work, do the washing-up,
or do everything.

36
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,580
‘Make’ means to create something and/or
produce a result.

37
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:24,680
If you make a shopping list, make dinner,
or make a presentation, then you create something;

38
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,370
there’s a result at the end of the process.

39
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,610
That’s the basic difference between ‘do’
and ‘make’.

40
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,819
In the rest of this lesson, you’ll learn
about ‘do’ and ‘make’ in more detail,

41
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:44,060
but keep this basic idea in your head.

42
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,480
What’s that?

43
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,050
I’m making a card for Sasha’s leaving
party.

44
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,840
I thought it would be nicer to make it myself,
rather than just buy something.

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,939
How’s it going?

46
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,730
It’s a lot harder than I thought it would
be!

47
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,080
This is my second attempt.

48
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,920
I made a lot of mistakes first time and I
had to throw it away, but now I think I’m

49
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,380
making progress.

50
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,180
What happened in the kitchen?

51
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,600
Did you make all that mess?

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,340
Ah…

53
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,980
Yeah…

54
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,190
I need to make a cake, too.

55
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,030
I mean, I’ve started making a cake.

56
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,211
Let me guess: ‘harder than you thought it
would be’?

57
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:20,211
Yeah…

58
00:03:20,211 --> 00:03:21,211
A little.

59
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:24,890
I’m trying to make an orange and chocolate
sponge.

60
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,280
There’s chocolate all over the walls!

61
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,019
What happened?

62
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:35,769
Well, the mixer was making a strange noise,
so I took the lid off to see if there was

63
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:42,280
a problem, but I forgot to turn it off, so
the chocolate mixture went everywhere.

64
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,340
Don’t worry; I’ll clean it up.

65
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,040
You can use ‘make’ when you create a result.

66
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,420
You can use ‘make’ for things with a physical
result, like ‘make a card’, ‘make a

67
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,739
cake’, or ‘make dinner’.

68
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:06,960
You can also use ‘make’ for non-physical
results, like ‘make a mistake’, ‘make

69
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,340
progress’ or ‘make a noise’.

70
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,720
Here’s a question: can you think of more
examples like this?

71
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:21,230
Pause the video and try to find three more
examples of phrases with ‘make’ which

72
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:28,700
describe *physical* results, and three which
describe *non-physical* results.

73
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,580
Can’t think of three?

74
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,850
Try to find one, or two!

75
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,740
Pause the video and do it now.

76
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,930
Ready?

77
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,060
What did you get?

78
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:49,200
For physical results, it’s common to use
‘make’ with food and drink, like ‘make

79
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,170
a sandwich’, ‘make a cup of coffee’,
or ‘make pizza.’

80
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:02,230
You can also ‘make a toy’, ‘make a chair’,
or ‘make a shelf’, if you can do it yourself.

81
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:09,110
You can say that companies make things; for
example, ‘Apple makes the iPhone’, or ‘Honda

82
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,890
makes cars’.

83
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,200
For non-physical results, there are many possibilities.

84
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:22,110
You could say ‘make a joke’, ‘make a
suggestion’, ‘make a friend’, or ‘make

85
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,600
an appointment.’

86
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,140
It’s also common to use ‘make’ with
money words, like ‘make money’, ‘make

87
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,310
a profit’ or ‘make an investment.’

88
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,990
Did you get any of these phrases?

89
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,210
Did you find examples that we didn’t?

90
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,990
Please share your ideas in the comments!

91
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:54,880
Next, let’s look at a slightly different
way to use ‘make’.

92
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,980
What’s wrong?

93
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,600
Did something happen?

94
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
What?

95
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,889
No, nothing.

96
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:00,889
You look sad.

97
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:02,690
It’s my allergies.

98
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,380
At this time of year, they make my face really
puffy.

99
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,220
Plus, they make my eyes water.

100
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,450
Are you taking anything?

101
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:16,560
Yeah, I take antihistamines, but they don’t
help that much, and they make me sleepy.

102
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,950
What are you allergic to?

103
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,950
Pollen?

104
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:24,100
I think so, but it makes me sensitive to other
things, too, like dust.

105
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,560
It’s bad, but it only lasts four weeks or
so.

106
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,370
You can use ‘make’ to mean ‘produce
a reaction in someone.’

107
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:39,740
Similar to the last section, this could be
a physical reaction, as in: ‘They make my

108
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:46,960
face really puffy,’
‘They make my eyes water.’

109
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,060
‘The antihistamines make me sleepy.’

110
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,460
You could also use it for emotional reactions.

111
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,420
For example: ‘The news made him angry.’

112
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,240
‘Thinking about what he said made me happy.’

113
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:12,760
Finally, you can use ‘make’ for reactions
which are both physical and emotional, like

114
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,530
this: ‘It was such a sad film.

115
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,860
It made me cry for hours.’

116
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,190
‘He’s so funny.

117
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,800
He makes me laugh all the time.’

118
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,000
OK, here’s a task for you.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,720
Look at three questions:
Can you answer these three questions for yourself?

120
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,640
Pause the video, and make your answers.

121
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,700
You can write them down, say them out loud,
or both.

122
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,700
OK?

123
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,990
Could you do it?

124
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:57,520
Of course, everyone’s answers will be different,
but here are three suggestions: ‘Being outside

125
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,780
on a beautiful day makes me really happy.’

126
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:10,880
‘The last thing that made me laugh was a
joke my colleague made in a meeting this morning.'

127
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,220
‘Someone not telling the truth could make
me angry.’

128
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,260
Were your answers similar, or not?

129
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:25,310
Feel free to post your answers in the comments
and share them with other learners.

130
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:30,030
Now, you’ve seen many ways to use ‘make’.

131
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,890
What about ‘do’?

132
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,240
Have you done the report for our sales meeting
tomorrow?

133
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
No.

134
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,469
I won’t be here.

135
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:41,099
Did you not get my email?

136
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,099
What email?

137
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,319
I sent it to you last week.

138
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:50,279
I’ve been doing a course on digital marketing,
and tomorrow I have to do the final exam.

139
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,100
So, who’ll do the report?

140
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,459
I don’t know!

141
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:57,379
Is there no way you can do it?

142
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:58,879
Sorry, no.

143
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:04,231
I’ve done most of my work for today, and
then I’m going straight home to do some

144
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,980
last-minute revision.

145
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:13,380
Remember that ‘do’ means that you perform
a task or an activity.

146
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:19,180
You often use it to talk about things you
do at work or school.

147
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,830
Look at three examples you heard in the dialogue.

148
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:29,170
Can you remember how to complete the missing
words?

149
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,760
Can you get the answers?

150
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:37,760
You’ll see them in a second.

151
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,920
So, you can ‘do work’, ‘do business’,
‘do a deal’, ‘do a report’, and so

152
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
on.

153
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,660
You can also use ‘do’ with other kinds
of work, like ‘do housework’ or ‘do

154
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,220
homework’.

155
00:09:53,230 --> 00:10:00,040
Also, you can use ‘do’ for many things
connected with school and education.

156
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:06,820
You ‘do research’, ‘do exams’, ‘do
a course’, ‘do revision’ and ‘do a

157
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,560
subject’.

158
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,100
With some of these, you can use other verbs,
too.

159
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,870
For example, you can ‘do an exam’, or
‘take an exam’.

160
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:22,449
You can also use ‘take’ with ‘course’
or ‘subject’.

161
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:29,860
For example, you can say ‘I have to take
four subjects in my first year of university,’

162
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,810
or ‘I have to do four subjects in my first
year…’

163
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:40,459
There’s no difference in meaning; it doesn’t
matter which you use.

164
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:50,699
Let’s look at one more common way to use
‘do’.

165
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:52,860
Have you done anything about the washing machine?

166
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,720
No, not yet.

167
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,690
Well, when are you going to do something?

168
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,069
It’s been a week.

169
00:10:58,069 --> 00:11:00,399
I’m running out of clean clothes!

170
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,910
You could do it too, you know.

171
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,019
I can’t do everything around here!

172
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:06,589
What do you mean ‘do everything’?

173
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:08,750
You’ve done nothing all day!

174
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,269
You spent the morning watching cartoons in
your underwear!

175
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:16,060
Fine, I’ll do it tomorrow.

176
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:21,810
You can use ‘do’ as a general verb in
phrases like ‘do something’.

177
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,759
You heard three more phrases like this in
the dialogue.

178
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,410
Can you remember them?

179
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:37,230
You heard, ‘do anything’, ‘do everything’
and ‘do nothing.’

180
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,999
You can use these phrases in different ways.

181
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:44,300
For example: ‘I need to do something about
my hair.

182
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,089
It’s a mess!’

183
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:52,720
‘Do you want to do anything this weekend?’

184
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,880
‘She’s so lazy!

185
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,900
She sits in her office all day doing nothing.’

186
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:07,920
‘They’re a very close couple; they do
everything together.’

187
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,460
Easy, right?

188
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,370
To practise, try to make your own examples,
too.

189
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,540
Let’s do one more thing.

190
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:21,899
In our last section, you’ll see some common
collocations and phrases using ‘make’

191
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,519
and ‘do’.

192
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,649
What did you make of the play?

193
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:32,279
It was interesting, but you could see that
they were on a tight budget.

194
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,379
They could have done with better lighting,
for one thing.

195
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,990
I could hardly see sometimes.

196
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,720
I know what you mean.

197
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,879
I thought they did a good job of making do
with what they had, but obviously it would

198
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,880
have been better if they’d had more resources.

199
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,380
Yeah, they did their best.

200
00:12:50,380 --> 00:13:00,050
Look at some phrasal verbs and collocations
with ‘make’ and ‘do’ which you heard.

201
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,980
Can you remember how they were used?

202
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:08,520
Could you explain what they meant?

203
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:15,600
‘Make of’ is mostly used in questions,
when you want to ask someone for their opinion.

204
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,430
If someone asks you ‘What did you make of
it?’, they want to know what you thought.

205
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:28,360
For example, if I ask you, ‘What did you
make of the concert?’, I’m asking you

206
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,899
for your opinion; did you like it, or not?

207
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,360
Did you think it was good, or not?

208
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,960
‘Do with’ means to want or need.

209
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,010
It’s conversational.

210
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:51,120
You might say ‘I could do with a cup of
tea’, meaning ‘I want a cup of tea.’

211
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,290
‘Do a good job’ is easier to guess.

212
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,280
If you do a good job, you do something well.

213
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:05,160
It doesn’t have to be about work; you could
use it about many things.

214
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:12,430
You can also use different adjectives; for
example ‘do a bad job’, ‘do an adequate

215
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,800
job’, and so on.

216
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,780
‘Make do’ is harder to explain.

217
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:26,680
Look at an example: ‘I didn’t have time
to cook, so we made do with some snacks and

218
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,040
small things.’

219
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,420
Does this help?

220
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,869
If you make do with something, you don’t
have what you want, so you have to find a

221
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:40,350
way to use something else.

222
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:47,360
Here’s another example: ‘After we moved,
the furniture didn’t arrive for a week,

223
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,889
so for a bed we had to make do with a mattress
on the floor.’

224
00:14:54,889 --> 00:15:00,749
This means that you didn’t have the thing
you wanted—your bed—so you had to use

225
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:02,850
something else.

226
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:08,509
‘Do your best’ means to try as hard as
you can.

227
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:13,410
It’s often used when you didn’t get the
result you wanted.

228
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:21,380
For example: ‘They did their best, but in
the end they lost three-nil.’

229
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,399
‘I did my best, but there was no way I could

230
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,680
manage everything alone.’

231
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,120
There are many more phrasal verbs and collocations
with ‘make’ and ‘do’.

232
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,709
Can you think of any more?
