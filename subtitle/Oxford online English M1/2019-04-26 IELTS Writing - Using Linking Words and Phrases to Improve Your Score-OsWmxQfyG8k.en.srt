00:00:01,329 --> 00:00:02,960
Hi, I’m Stephanie.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,350
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:12,100
In this lesson, you can learn how to use linking
words and phrases for the IELTS writing exam.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:18,500
Linking words are important for your IELTS
writing, especially for the essay.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:26,660
Using linking words well can make a big difference
to your coherence and cohesion score, which

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,500
is 25% of your writing score.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,800
Even if you’re not preparing for an IELTS
exam and just want to improve your English

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,820
writing generally, this lesson could help
you!

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,300
Let’s start with a question.

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,520
You’re thinking about ‘linking words’.

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:11,160
Many students ask about ‘linking words’;
they ask things like, “What linking words

15
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,010
should I use in my IELTS essay?”

16
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:21,470
But what are ‘linking words’, and why
are they important?

17
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,750
What are linking words?

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,900
How would you answer this question?

19
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,700
First, ‘linking words’ includes both words
and phrases.

20
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,180
There are single words, like ‘however’,
and phrases, like ‘as a result.’

21
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:47,060
Secondly, linking words can be conjunctions,
like ‘and’ or ‘because’, which you

22
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,480
use in the middle of a sentence.

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:58,280
Linking words can also be adverbs, like ‘consequently’
or ‘on the other hand’, which you generally

24
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,450
use at the start of a new sentence.

25
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,640
Next, what do linking words do?

26
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,090
Why do you need to use them?

27
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:16,170
This is an important question, but it has
a simple answer: linking words make your writing

28
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,920
clearer for your reader.

29
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,800
Don’t use linking words because you want
to sound academic, or because you want to

30
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,300
impress the examiner, or because you think
using linking words is going to get you a better

31
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,660
score on your IELTS.

32
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:40,160
It *is* necessary to use linking words to
get higher scores, but you need to use them

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,270
in the right way.

34
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,680
You use linking words to make the structure
of your ideas clearer.

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,580
What does this mean?

36
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,320
Let’s look at an example together.

37
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,200
Read this sentence:
Next, imagine that the next sentence starts

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:07,210
with ‘also,’ ‘on the other hand,’
or ‘consequently’.

39
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,750
What do these tell you?

40
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:18,040
What do you know if you see that the first
word of the next sentence is ‘also’?

41
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:26,460
What’s the difference between using ‘also’
or ‘on the other hand’?

42
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:33,060
These linking words show you the direction
of the next sentence.

43
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,520
If the next sentence starts with ‘also’,
you know that it will add another, similar

44
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,240
point.

45
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:47,020
If it starts with ‘on the other hand’,
you know that the writer will make a contrasting

46
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,599
point.

47
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:55,140
If it starts with ‘consequently’, you
know that the writer will describe a result

48
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,269
of this situation.

49
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:03,700
This is why you use linking words, and this
is why they can be powerful.

50
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,340
In this example, you can know the general
idea of the next sentence before you read

51
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,840
it.

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,040
This makes your writing easier to follow.

53
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:22,200
Next, let’s look at the details of using
linking words well in your IELTS writing tasks.

54
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:29,040
Learning about linking words for your IELTS
writing exam can be overwhelming.

55
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,060
There are so many words and phrases: ‘in
addition’, ‘although’, ‘except for’,

56
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,660
‘due to’…

57
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,660
There are tens of things you *could* study.

58
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,860
However, we’ve got good news for you!

59
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,900
You don’t need to learn big lists of words.

60
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,080
So, what should you do?

61
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,300
The best way is to think about linking words
in terms of function.

62
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,760
What do we mean by ‘function’?

63
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,240
Many different linking words do the same job.

64
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,060
For example: However, on the other hand,

65
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,640
nevertheless, and although

66
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:21,040
all show a contrast between two related—but
different—things.

67
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,100
This doesn’t mean they’re exactly the
same, but they are similar.

68
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,880
So, what else can linking words do?

69
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,460
Linking words can connect similar ideas together.

70
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,040
Let’s call this ‘addition’.

71
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,400
A very simple example is ‘and’.

72
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:48,840
You can also use ‘furthermore’, ‘in
addition’, ‘also’, or ‘moreover’.

73
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:55,860
Linking words can show the reason or purpose
of something, like ‘because’, ‘due to’,

74
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,479
‘in order to’, or ‘so that’.

75
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:08,990
You can use linking words to connect a cause
and effect, like ‘therefore’, ‘so’,

76
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,169
‘consequently’ or ‘as a result’.

77
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:18,129
There are others, but this is a good starting
point.

78
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:29,500
Remember these four functions: contrast, addition,
reason or purpose, and cause-effect.

79
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,380
Let’s practise!

80
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:33,199
Look at four sentences.

81
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,539
Each has a linking word or phrase highlighted
in red.

82
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:44,919
Can you say what function the linking word
or phrase has in each sentence?

83
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,600
Pause the video if you want more time to think.

84
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,900
Ready?

85
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,320
Let’s look at the answers.

86
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,100
In the first sentence, ‘due to’ expresses
a reason.

87
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,160
In the second sentence, ‘moreover’ expresses
addition.

88
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:12,100
You’re making one point, then using ‘moreover’
to add a second point on the same topic.

89
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,240
In the third sentence, ‘although’ shows
a contrast.

90
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,880
In the fourth sentence, ‘as a result’
connects a cause and its effect.

91
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,760
So, what should you do here?

92
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:33,100
Here’s the most important point: you don’t
need to know every linking word and phrase

93
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,460
to get a high score in your IELTS writing
exam.

94
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:43,949
You need maybe two or three linking words
for each function.

95
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:51,909
That means you need two to three linking words
to express addition, two to three linking

96
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:56,760
words to express contrast, and so on.

97
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,520
There’s one thing you should know: linking
words can have other functions which we haven’t

98
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:03,689
covered here.

99
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:08,129
That’s because we don’t want this lesson
to be hours long.

100
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:16,069
Examples include: showing similarity, showing
a sequence of events in time, or expressing

101
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,509
conditions.

102
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:21,029
However, the basic idea is the same.

103
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:25,189
Don’t try to learn big lists of linking
words.

104
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:28,590
Instead, focus on functions.

105
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:34,310
For each function, learn two to three linking
words and phrases.

106
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,770
This is simpler and easier for you.

107
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:44,570
You should do this now: write down a list
of functions, and write down two to three

108
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,450
linking words for each.

109
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:54,500
You can use the functions and linking words
from this section, or you can add your own.

110
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,960
Pause the video and do it now!

111
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,460
Ready?

112
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:07,770
Let’s see what else you need to know to
use linking words well in your IELTS writing

113
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:12,320
exam.

114
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,680
To use a linking word or phrase well in your
writing, you need to know two things.

115
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,080
One: you need to know the function, which
you learned about in the last section.

116
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,520
Two: you need to know the grammar of the linking
word or phrase.

117
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,040
Let’s look at this now!

118
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,580
Linking words and phrases can be divided into
three categories.

119
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,000
First, some linking words are conjunctions.

120
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,640
Most are subordinating conjunctions, meaning
that they need to be used in a sentence with

121
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,630
at least two clauses.

122
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:57,760
For example, ‘because’ and ‘although’
are both subordinating conjunctions.

123
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,780
After these words, you add a clause.

124
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:08,460
Then, you need another, independent clause
to complete the sentence.

125
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:15,550
For example: ‘I need to ask for some time
off work because I am planning to attend a

126
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,500
training course.’

127
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:24,500
‘Although social media can help people to
connect with each other, it also has several

128
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,100
significant disadvantages’.

129
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,720
Secondly, some linking words are prepositions.

130
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,910
This means you need to use a noun after the
linking word.

131
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:44,330
‘Due to’, ‘despite’ and ‘because
of’ are all prepositions.

132
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:50,340
For example: ‘Despite the well-known health
benefits of regular exercise, many people

133
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,080
still lead a mostly sedentary lifestyle.’

134
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,620
Or: ‘Young professionals are increasingly
moving to smaller cities because of the high

135
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,120
cost of living in large urban centres.’

136
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:13,580
Finally, many linking words are adverbs, like
‘on the other hand’ or ‘therefore’.

137
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,560
These are generally used at the beginning
of a sentence.

138
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,070
When you use adverbs like this, you need to
put a comma afterwards.

139
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:33,160
For example: ‘Freedom of the press is more
important than individuals’ rights to privacy.

140
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:41,180
Therefore, newspapers should be able to publish
stories about the private lives of celebrities

141
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,600
if they choose to.’

142
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:52,640
Or: ‘Of course, elderly people should be
paid a pension which reflects the money they

143
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:59,520
paid into the social security system during
their working lives.

144
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:07,930
On the other hand, the pension system needs
to be sustainable over the long term.’

145
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,640
This is most of what you need to know about
linking word grammar.

146
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:19,560
Is your linking word or phrase a conjunction,
a preposition, or an adverb?

147
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,250
We have a task for you!

148
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:27,610
At the end of part two, you wrote down linking
words that you wanted to learn.

149
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:34,010
Now, use an online dictionary like Cambridge
or Longman, and find out if the words you

150
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:40,430
wrote down are conjunctions, prepositions,
or adverbs.

151
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:46,460
Go on, pause the video and do it now!

152
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,720
Done?

153
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,840
There are still a couple of things you need
to think about.

154
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,840
One problem is that similar-looking words
can be different parts of speech.

155
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:06,700
For example, ‘because’ is a conjunction,
but ‘because of’ is a preposition.

156
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:14,170
‘In spite of’ is a preposition, but ‘in
spite of the fact that’ is a conjunction.

157
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:21,940
So, don’t assume that linking words are
used in the same way just because they look

158
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,570
similar.

159
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,920
Another problem is that some linking words
can be more than one part of speech.

160
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:37,290
For example, ‘so’ can be an adverb or
a conjunction.

161
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,820
What should you do with this information?

162
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,300
Let’s look in more detail!

163
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:53,290
At this point, you hopefully have short lists
of linking words, divided by function.

164
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:58,250
You should also know which part of speech
each linking word is.

165
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:03,310
Let’s think: why are you doing things in
this way?

166
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,780
How will this help you in your IELTS writing
exam?

167
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:14,740
Here’s what you need to remember: it’s
*much* more effective to know a smaller number

168
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,970
of linking words or phrases and know how to
use them really well.

169
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,720
Many IELTS students take the opposite path.

170
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:31,300
They learn lots and lots of linking words,
but they don’t know how to use them correctly.

171
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,970
This won’t help your IELTS writing score.

172
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:40,340
It’s much more important to focus on accuracy.

173
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,540
So, what should you do next?

174
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:50,110
Your next task is to find out *exactly* how
your linking words are used.

175
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,140
Linking words with the same function aren’t
always the same.

176
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,490
Many linking words have a very specific meaning.

177
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:08,910
For example, ‘furthermore’ and ‘besides’
are both used to add information to a topic,

178
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,260
but they aren’t the same.

179
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,600
Do you know why not?

180
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:21,360
‘Furthermore’ is used to add a point which
is more important than your first idea.

181
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,800
For example: ‘Using plastic products generates
litter which harms the environment.

182
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,600
Furthermore, plastic can take hundreds of
years to degrade.’

183
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:41,100
In this case, you’re saying that the second
point, after ‘furthermore’ is more important

184
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,820
than the first point.

185
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:51,420
‘Besides’ is used to add a point which
is often less important than your main idea.

186
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:57,280
For example: ‘Smoking has been proven to
cause many serious illnesses.

187
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,810
Besides, it is an expensive habit.’

188
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:09,160
In this case, you’re saying that the second
point, after ‘besides’, is *not* more

189
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,840
important than the first point.

190
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:20,500
You’re adding an extra point which is not
essential to your argument.

191
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:26,340
We’re not doing this because you need to
learn about ‘furthermore’ and ‘besides’.

192
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:33,840
The point is that every linking word is used
in a slightly different way.

193
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:43,300
To improve your IELTS writing score, you need
to understand exactly how to use linking words.

194
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,530
How can you do this?

195
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,620
Here are a few suggestions.

196
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,950
First, use online dictionaries to find example
sentences.

197
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:57,300
The Cambridge dictionary has many examples
for each word.

198
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:04,189
Next, try to understand what makes this linking
word different from other, similar linking

199
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,500
words.

200
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,980
Is it more formal, or more conversational?

201
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,659
Is it only used in very specific situations?

202
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:16,539
Finally, check your ideas.

203
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:19,279
If you can ask a teacher, then do that.

204
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:25,990
If not, use online resources such as Quora
or the Wordreference forums.

205
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,820
By the way, you can find links to all the
resources mentioned in this lesson below the

206
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,820
video.

207
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:39,110
This is a big topic, and there’s a lot of
information in this video; however, you haven’t

208
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:45,560
even seen the most important thing about linking
words yet…

209
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:54,960
Here’s the most important idea about linking
words: you can’t connect ideas with linking

210
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,220
words.

211
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,220
What?

212
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,809
That doesn’t make sense, you say.

213
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:05,899
What do linking words do if they don’t connect
ideas?

214
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:13,759
Linking words don’t connect ideas; they
highlight a connection which is already there.

215
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:22,129
They make the connection—which already exists—clearer
to your reader.

216
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:26,929
This is important because it’s one of the
biggest problems IELTS students have with

217
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:29,119
linking words.

218
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,610
IELTS candidates know they need to use linking
words, so they do.

219
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:40,269
But, very often, their linking words don’t
fit the logic of their ideas.

220
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:43,190
This is a common feature of band six writing.

221
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:52,390
Here’s an example, which is from a real
practice essay written by one of our students:

222
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,620
We see this problem all the time.

223
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:04,280
There’s a linking phrase—‘for instance’—which
should be used to introduce an example of

224
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,640
the preceding point.

225
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,720
But, in this case, the points before and after
the linking word are not obviously connected

226
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,309
at all.

227
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:22,230
The point after ‘for instance’ is certainly
not an example of a trade war between manufacturing

228
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,909
companies or countries.

229
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:31,499
Remember: this is *very* common, and it’s
also a common reason why students can’t

230
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:35,730
get scores above six or six point five.

231
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:42,519
If you do this in your writing, your coherence
and cohesion score will be limited to six

232
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,420
maximum.

233
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:51,020
We’ll say it again: you can’t create a
connection by using linking words or phrases.

234
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:56,020
The connection is already there, in the logic
of your ideas.

235
00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:01,500
You use the linking word to highlight the
connection which already exists.

236
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:10,499
So, to use linking words well, you need to
have a clear understanding of your essay structure

237
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:13,999
and how your ideas are organised.

238
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:19,049
This mostly depends on planning before you
start writing your answer.

239
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:25,400
If your ideas aren’t well-organised in your
mind, then using linking words won’t help

240
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,989
you.

241
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:32,450
Like you heard, this is a big topic, so let’s
review what you should do.

242
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:38,529
One: divide linking words according to the
idea they express.

243
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:43,809
Start by learning two to three linking words
or phrases for each function.

244
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:52,220
Two: understand the grammar of each linking
word; find out what part of speech it is,

245
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,240
and how to use it in a sentence.

246
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,210
Three: go into more detail.

247
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:04,639
Many words have a similar meaning, but very
few words have exactly the same meaning.

248
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,779
Most words have unique features which you
need to know about if you want to use the

249
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:10,890
word well.

250
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:18,220
Four: practise planning and make sure your
ideas are well-organised before you start

251
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,720
writing.

252
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:28,460
Effective linking depends on logic and structure,
not on the words and phrases you use.

253
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,080
Good luck if you have an IELTS exam coming
up soon, and thanks for watching!

254
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,080
See you next time!
