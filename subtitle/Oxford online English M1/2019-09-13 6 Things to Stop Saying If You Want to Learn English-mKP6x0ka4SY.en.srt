00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,550
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,849
In this lesson, you’ll see six things we
often hear from English learners we meet.

4
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:11,490
We see them in YouTube comments.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,620
We hear them in classes.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,740
Do you want to learn English and make faster
progress?

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,050
Of course you do!

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,080
You should stop saying these things.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,530
Stop saying “It’s difficult.”

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,500
Definitely, never say “It’s too difficult.”

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,790
Instead, say “I need more time.”

12
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,980
When you say “It’s difficult,” you’re
immediately taking a negative approach.

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,050
It’s like saying “I can’t do it,”
“I should give up,” “There’s no point

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,890
trying.”

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,810
This way of thinking makes you feel bad about
yourself, and it discourages you from trying

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,320
further.

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,140
Everything is difficult when it’s new and
unfamiliar.

18
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:58,649
When you learn English—or any language—you
have to deal with many new and unfamiliar

19
00:00:58,649 --> 00:00:59,649
things.

20
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:01,820
But, guess what?

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,680
With time and practice, everything gets easier.

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,750
So, don’t say “This grammar point is too
difficult.”

23
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,549
Don’t say “Writing essays is too difficult.”

24
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:14,210
Don’t say “Speaking fluently is difficult.”

25
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,720
Say “I need more time to understand this
grammar point.”

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,630
Say “I need more time to learn how to write
essays well.”

27
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,490
Say “I need more time in order to speak
more fluently.”

28
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,720
This helps you approach your English learning
in a positive way, so that you’re focused

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,439
on improving and progressing.

30
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,420
Stop saying “I understand.”

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,120
Don’t say “I understand this vocabulary.”

32
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,960
Don’t say “I understand these grammar
rules.”

33
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:50,880
Don’t say “I understand what people say,
but I can’t respond!”

34
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,840
Many English learners—and language learners
generally—fall into the same trap.

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,619
They confuse understanding something with
knowing it.

36
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:07,510
But, really knowing something—for most learners—means
that you can use it.

37
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,119
I understand *how* to play the piano.

38
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,150
You hit the keys in the right order at the
right times.

39
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,349
I can’t play the piano.

40
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:19,760
So, is it useful that I understand how?

41
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
No.

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,450
Let’s come back to you, and your English.

43
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,510
You’re reading something in English.

44
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,120
You find a word you don’t know.

45
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,700
You look it up in your dictionary, so you
know the translation in your language.

46
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,810
You think to yourself, “I know this word
now.”

47
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,480
You go to English class.

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,560
Your teacher gives you exercises on a grammar
point.

49
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,760
You do the exercise, and you get most of the
questions right.

50
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,090
You think to yourself, “I know this grammar.”

51
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,820
Maybe you even complain to your teacher, and
say “This grammar is too easy!

52
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,459
I know this already!”

53
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:55,650
You read a text.

54
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,140
You understand it, or at least most of it.

55
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,800
When you try to write something in English,
it’s a mess.

56
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,200
You can’t put your ideas into sentences,
and your writing is full of mistakes.

57
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,310
So then, you start saying things like “I
understand words but I can’t use them!”

58
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,920
“I understand when I listen, but I can’t
speak!”

59
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,520
“I understand grammar, but I make mistakes
when I speak or write!”

60
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,220
First of all, it’s natural for your passive
skills to be better than your active skills.

61
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,950
It’s natural that your listening and reading
are better than your speaking and writing.

62
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,510
To some extent, this is normal and it isn’t
a problem.

63
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,450
It’s true for native speakers, too.

64
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,940
But, many English learners *do* have a problem
here.

65
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,930
They focus on understanding, and then they
complain that they can’t use what they “know”.

66
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,659
If you can’t use it, then you don’t know
it.

67
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:51,090
If you make mistakes with a grammar point,
then you don’t know it.

68
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,800
If you can’t use a word when you’re speaking,
then you don’t know the word.

69
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,230
It doesn’t matter if you’ve studied something
a hundred times.

70
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,570
Can you use it?

71
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,570
No?

72
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,440
Then you don’t know it.

73
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,739
So, don’t say “I understand…”

74
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:10,099
Instead, say “I can use this,” or “I
can’t use this.”

75
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:11,690
That’s what counts.

76
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,989
That’s what you care about, right?

77
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,190
Stop saying “How do I…?

78
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,870
Don’t say “How do I remember new words?”

79
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,839
Don’t say “How do I get 7.5 in IELTS?”

80
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,680
Don’t say “How do I improve my listening?”

81
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,659
Instead, ask yourself “What can I do today?”

82
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:39,509
Say “What can I do today to learn some new
vocabulary?”

83
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:43,669
Say “What can I do today to prepare for
my IELTS exam?”

84
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:49,819
Say “What can I do today to practise my
listening skills?”

85
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:53,419
We meet many students who ask huge, general
questions like this.

86
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,900
“How do I speak fluently?”

87
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,120
“How do I write a high-scoring IELTS essay?”

88
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,620
“How do I speak with a British accent?”

89
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,789
These questions are too big.

90
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:09,029
You don’t do one thing to speak fluently,
you do many, many things over a long time.

91
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:14,370
When you ask big, general questions like these,
you get trapped in abstract generalities.

92
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,559
You’re living in a future dream, where you
somehow speak perfect English.

93
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:22,300
But, you can’t control the future.

94
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,469
All that time you spend thinking about the
abstract future, you’re wasting time right

95
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:28,509
now.

96
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:31,340
Focus on what you can do today.

97
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,499
There’s a saying in English.

98
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:39,439
Actually, it’s in the form of a question:
how do you eat an elephant?

99
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,680
Have you heard this?

100
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,169
Do you know the answer?

101
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:46,029
You eat an elephant one bite at a time.

102
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:48,979
That’s what learning English is like.

103
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:51,590
If you look at the whole task, it seems impossible.

104
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,479
It’s like eating an elephant.

105
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,669
It’s too big.

106
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,669
But, you can do it.

107
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:58,669
People do it!

108
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,199
It’s not even rare.

109
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,449
You can do it, too.

110
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:04,500
You just have to do it one bite at a time.

111
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,280
Focus on what you can do today.

112
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,099
That’s the only thing you can control.

113
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:14,749
Stop asking questions like “How long will
it take me to…?”

114
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:19,219
Don’t say “How long does it take to become
fluent in English?”

115
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:23,379
Don’t say “How long will it take me to
get band seven in IELTS?”

116
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:29,159
Don’t say “How long will it take me to
learn to negotiate in English for my work?”

117
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:31,310
First, no one knows.

118
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,099
You don’t know, and I don’t know.

119
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:34,629
No one knows.

120
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:37,280
Maybe you’re a genius and you’ll do it
in four weeks.

121
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,599
Maybe it’ll take you four years.

122
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,300
Maybe you’ll never do it.

123
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,569
How am I supposed to know?

124
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,319
How’s anyone supposed to know?

125
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,650
Every learner is a little bit different.

126
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,910
No one has the same experience.

127
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,990
Secondly, often, this question hides something
underneath.

128
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,300
This question often says “I don’t want
to study English; I don’t want to spend

129
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,639
my time and money studying English, but I
have to.

130
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,080
So, how can I get what I want while spending
as little time and money as possible?”

131
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,760
Look: being efficient with your time and money
is a worthwhile goal, but if you’re trying

132
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,559
to learn English and your starting point is:
“How do I do this cheaply and without spending

133
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:22,650
much time?” then your chances of success
are slim.

134
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:27,249
Here’s the answer: if you don’t want to
study English, then don’t.

135
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:28,659
You don’t have to.

136
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:32,800
If you really don’t want to, then you probably
won’t learn much anyway.

137
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,279
So, what should you say instead?

138
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,520
Instead, ask “What’s the next step if
I want to…?”

139
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,420
“What’s the next step if I want to
get band seven in IELTS?”

140
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,360
“What’s the next step if I want to
improve my speaking?”

141
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,739
“What’s the next step if I want to
stop making so many grammar mistakes?”

142
00:07:54,739 --> 00:08:01,479
Again, these questions focus you on the present
and encourage you to take action now.

143
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:06,599
This increases your chances of making progress.

144
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,520
Stop saying “I can’t.”

145
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,509
Don’t say “I can’t speak fluently.”

146
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:15,839
Don’t say “I can’t understand films
and TV in English.”

147
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,369
Don’t say “I can’t write without making
mistakes.”

148
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:23,380
Instead, ask yourself “Why?”

149
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,379
“Why can’t I speak fluently?”

150
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,409
“Why can’t I understand films and TV in
English?”

151
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:32,520
“Why do I make so many mistakes when I write?”

152
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,840
There’s a reason.

153
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,420
There’s an answer to all these questions.

154
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,599
If you want to learn, you need to find the
answer.

155
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,650
There might not just be *one* answer, there
could be many.

156
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,690
The answer might not be simple.

157
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,959
In fact, it almost certainly won’t be.

158
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,750
But, finding an answer is the first step.

159
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,160
Why can’t you speak fluently?

160
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,970
Maybe you don’t get enough opportunities
to speak English.

161
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,399
Maybe you live 99% of your life speaking and
thinking in your native language.

162
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,530
Maybe you lack vocabulary.

163
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,980
Maybe your pronunciation needs work.

164
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,170
Maybe something else.

165
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,470
I don’t know.

166
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,279
Remember: every learner is a little bit different!

167
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,779
You need to find the answer for you.

168
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:23,310
Thinking this way will encourage you to take
action and do something now.

169
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,829
Saying “I can’t…” all the time just
makes you feel bad.

170
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:31,720
Find out why, then do something about it.

171
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,899
Stop saying “I want...”

172
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,930
Stop saying “I need…”

173
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,840
Don’t say “I want to improve my speaking.”

174
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,040
Don’t say “I want to have a bigger vocabulary.”

175
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,640
Don’t say “I need to get band six point
five in IELTS.”

176
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:55,300
Often, when English learners say, “I want…”
or “I need…”, there’s a second meaning.

177
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,899
It’s not bad to have goals or to want things.

178
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:02,740
But, if you say this, is this all you mean?

179
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,180
Many people who say these things really mean
“I want *someone else* to give this to me.”

180
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,730
I want *someone else* to solve this problem.

181
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,029
I want *someone else* to wave a magic wand
and get me my IELTS result.

182
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:21,220
I want *someone else* to take away all the
bad feelings and the hard work and the difficulties.

183
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,770
It doesn’t work like that, and it’s never
going to.

184
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:30,060
You heard this before, but I’ll say it again:
you don’t have to learn English!

185
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,160
But, but, but…

186
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,329
I need it for my job.

187
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:34,940
I have to learn English to emigrate to Australia.

188
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,040
I have to learn English for my exams at university.

189
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,360
No, you don’t.

190
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,430
No one’s forcing you to learn English.

191
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,389
You want to, or you don’t.

192
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:46,139
If you want to, then do it.

193
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:49,810
If you don’t, then save your time, your
money and your energy.

194
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,080
And, for sure, no one else will make it happen
for you.

195
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,860
Other people can help.

196
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,810
Good teachers can help.

197
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,319
English-speaking friends and colleagues can
help.

198
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:03,029
But, in the end, it depends on you.

199
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:09,310
So, don’t say “I want…” or “I need…”
if what you really mean is “I want someone

200
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,920
else to give me the solution.”

201
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,180
Don’t wait for someone else to solve your
problems.

202
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:17,579
Take responsibility for your own progress.

203
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,870
I’m not saying that to be unkind.

204
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,240
I’m saying it because you’re the only
person who can.

205
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,000
That’s it.

206
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,940
Thanks for watching!
