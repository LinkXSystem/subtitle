00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,360
Hi, I'm Oli.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,210
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,780
In this pronunciation lesson, you can see
everything you need to think about in order

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,730
to pronounce one English sentence correctly.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,840
You’ll see that there’s a lot to think
about, even in just one sentence!

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,130
Let's look at our example: Although we hadn’t
planned everything perfectly, it all went

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,570
as smoothly as anyone could expect.

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,160
Try reading the sentence.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,079
Is it difficult?

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,079
Easy?

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,960
Let’s see what you need to think about to
pronounce this sentence naturally and clearly.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,380
The most basic thing to get right is the sounds.

13
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:53,750
Depending on what language you speak, you
might find some English sounds more difficult

14
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,280
to pronounce than others.

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,059
In this sentence, which sounds do you find
most difficult to pronounce?

16
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:04,949
‘Th’ sounds are difficult for many English
learners.

17
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:11,909
So, you might need to pay extra attention
to the /ð/ sounds in although and smoothly,

18
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,460
and the /θ/ sound in everything.

19
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,740
What else?

20
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:24,799
Some vowel sounds can be challenging, like
the /əʊ/ sound in although, or the /ɛː/

21
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,060
sound in perfectly.

22
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,770
Finally, pronouncing sounds right isn’t
just about pronouncing single sounds.

23
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,759
Sometimes, sounds which are easy to pronounce
by themselves can become a problem when you

24
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,710
have to combine them with other sounds.

25
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,960
Again, which combinations are easy or difficult
for you will depend on your native language.

26
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,700
For many English learners, the combination
of /ð/ and /əʊ/ in although is difficult.

27
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,700
Although

28
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,720
Although

29
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:06,320
Consonant combinations, like the ‘pl’
in planned or the ‘xp’ in expect, are

30
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,200
also challenging for some English learners.

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Planned

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,820
Expect

33
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,640
Now, you have a job to do.

34
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,890
Read the sentence aloud two or three times.

35
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,200
Find the sounds or sound combinations which
are most difficult for you.

36
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,970
You can pause the video and do this now.

37
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:34,660
When you know which sounds you need to practice,
start by just practicing the sound.

38
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:42,049
For example, if you chose the /ð/ sound,
like the ‘th’ in smoothly, then start

39
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:44,400
by just practicing the sound.

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,440
/ð/

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,120
Then, take a short word with the sound, like
the, or this.

42
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,790
Say the words several times to practice.

43
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,159
Focus on getting the sound right.

44
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,819
Start slowly until you’re sure you can pronounce
it correctly.

45
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:10,510
Finally, practice with longer words, like
smoothly, although or brother.

46
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:17,319
Again, say the words several times, and start
slowly to make sure you get the sounds right.

47
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,770
In this way, you can improve your pronunciation
of English sounds which are difficult for

48
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,770
you.

49
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,560
Next, let’s talk about stress and prominence.

50
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,820
I’m guessing that most of you know what
stress is, but some of you might be thinking:

51
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,269
what’s prominence?

52
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:42,519
Prominence is similar to stress, but I’m
going to use a different name because it’s

53
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,510
not exactly the same, and I think it’s useful
for you to remember that these are two different

54
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,370
things.

55
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,300
Stress is found in words which have more than
one syllable.

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:59,060
For example, in the word everything, the stress
is on the first ‘e’.

57
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,640
Everything

58
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,040
Everything

59
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,560
In the word expect, the stress is on the second
‘e’.

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
Expect

61
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,720
Expect

62
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,380
Now, you can see the stress in the other words
of the sentence:

63
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:24,360
Although we hadn't planned everything perfectly, it all went as smoothly as anyone could expect.

64
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,960
Stress is fixed; it doesn’t change.

65
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,100
The stress in expect is always on the second
‘e’.

66
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,350
Every time you say expect, you need to put
stress in the same place.

67
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,630
So, what about prominence?

68
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,010
Prominence means that the key words and ideas
in a sentence are emphasised.

69
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,920
It’s similar to stress, because you’re
pronouncing some words and syllables more

70
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,290
strongly than others.

71
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,110
However, it’s different to stress, because
it’s not fixed.

72
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,850
Prominence depends on the sentence and the
situation.

73
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:06,650
The same sentence can have different prominent
words depending on the speaker, or on the

74
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,650
situation.

75
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,070
Also, words which have one syllable don’t
have stress, but they can have prominence.

76
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:18,790
For example, all could be prominent in our
example sentence.

77
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,160
You heard before that the prominent words
in a sentence are the most important words

78
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,690
and ideas.

79
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,460
The prominent words are the words that carry
the meaning of the sentence.

80
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,870
So, look at our sentence again.

81
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,590
Which words do you think will be prominent?

82
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,450
Think about it, and even if you’re not sure,
take a guess!

83
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,610
It doesn’t matter if you get it wrong.

84
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,780
Pause the video if you want more thinking
time.

85
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,940
Here’s my suggestion.

86
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:59,610
Although we HADN'T PLANNED EVERYTHING PERFECTLY,
it ALL went as SMOOTHLY as ANYONE could EXPECT.

87
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,490
Because prominence is flexible, this is only
a suggestion.

88
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,700
If you want to emphasise different points,
you might make some words more prominent.

89
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,850
For example:

90
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:16,900
Although we hadn’t planned everything perfectly,
it all went as smoothly as anyone could expect.

91
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:24,700
Or, although we hadn’t planned everything perfectly,
it all went as smoothly as anyone could expect.

92
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:32,800
Or, although we hadn’t planned everything perfectly,
it all went as smoothly as anyone could expect.

93
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Which is right?

94
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,890
They all are!

95
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,960
It depends on what you want to say.

96
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,810
This shows you another point: prominence can
have different levels.

97
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,470
Some words can be more prominent than others;
you can have different levels of prominence

98
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,760
in a sentence.

99
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,130
Stress and prominence are both essential for
your English pronunciation.

100
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,350
When I meet English learners, I generally
have no problems understanding people if they

101
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,240
make some mistakes with sounds.

102
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:08,270
But, if someone makes mistakes with stress,
it can be really hard to understand them.

103
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,900
Think of stress and prominence as two layers
over the sentence.

104
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,990
The first layer is the stress, which is fixed.

105
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,360
The second layer is the prominence, which
is flexible.

106
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,860
You need to pronounce both together:

107
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:30,200
Although we hadn't planned everything perfectly, it all went as smoothly as anyone could expect.

108
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,220
The prominence might change, but the stress
stays the same:

109
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:41,320
Although we hadn't planned everything perfectly, it all went as smoothly as anyone could expect.

110
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,200
Try reading the sentence in different ways.

111
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,220
Change the prominent words.

112
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:53,530
Also, think about a question: how does changing
the prominence change the meaning?

113
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,860
Why would you make some words prominent and
not others?

114
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:03,080
That’s a question to think about: there
are many possible answers.

115
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,690
It’s enough for now just to think about
these ideas.

116
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,340
This will already help your English pronunciation!

117
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,180
Next, you’re going to think about weak forms.

118
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:24,120
Weak forms are words which have a different
pronunciation when they aren’t prominent.

119
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,120
For example, look at the word as.

120
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,360
There are two.

121
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,709
These words aren’t prominent, and the pronunciation
in this sentence will change.

122
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:38,189
It’s not /æz/; it’s /əz/.

123
00:08:38,189 --> 00:08:41,180
Which other words in our sentence have weak
forms?

124
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,279
Do you know?

125
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,670
Could is definitely weak.

126
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,600
Its pronunciation changes from /kʊd/ to /kəd/.

127
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,130
There are other words which might be weak
forms.

128
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,689
There’s a grey area where it’s hard to
say if a word is definitely a weak form or

129
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:00,120
not.

130
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,720
For example, if you say the sentence very
fast, the pronunciation of we might change

131
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,579
from /wiː/ to /wɪ/.

132
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:13,629
The pronunciation of hadn’t might change
from /hædnt/ to /hədnt/.

133
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:17,380
However, these changes don’t always happen.

134
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:22,310
You’ll only use these weak forms if you’re
speaking really fast.

135
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:29,040
For now, focus on the words which are definitely
weak forms: as, as, and could.

136
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,449
Let’s read the sentence with the weak forms:

137
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:38,630
Although we hadn’t planned everything perfectly,
it all went /əz/ smoothly /əz/ anyone /kəd/

138
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,910
expect.

139
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,420
Weak forms are closely connected to stress
and prominence.

140
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,680
To sound natural in English, you need a clear
contrast between syllables which are stressed

141
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,110
and syllables which are weak or unstressed.

142
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:56,270
Here’s a tip: make the contrast as clear
as possible.

143
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:02,170
To do this, pronounce the stressed and prominent
syllables more strongly and clearly.

144
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,580
Pronounce the weak and unstressed syllables
as fast as you can:

145
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:13,760
Although we hadn't planned everything perfectly, it all went as smoothly as anyone could expect.

146
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,500
You can hear that this contrast between stressed
and unstressed gives the sentence a rhythm.

147
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,500
This rhythm is very important if you want
to sound natural in English.

148
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,520
There’s another point which is important
for the rhythm of the sentence: intonation.

149
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,500
Intonation is how your voice moves up and
down as you talk: whether your voice goes

150
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,639
higher or lower.

151
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,920
The easiest way to get the intonation right
is simply to listen and try to copy it.

152
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,760
Although we hadn't planned everything perfectly, it all went as smoothly as anyone could expect.

153
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,700
For some of you, that might be enough.

154
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:59,689
However, in case you need more help, let’s
look at the intonation of this sentence in

155
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:00,689
more detail.

156
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:09,519
There are six basic intonation patterns in
English: high, low, rising, falling, falling-rising

157
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,240
and rising-falling.

158
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,980
Each of these can be used in different ways.

159
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:20,589
For example, rising-falling intonation can
be used to show excitement, surprise, or anger.

160
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:24,760
Also, like prominence, intonation isn’t
fixed.

161
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,330
Remember this point, because what I’ll show
you is not the only possibility.

162
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:36,769
First: you generally need a rising tone to
show that your sentence is not finished.

163
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:41,540
That means perfectly gets a rising intonation.

164
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,000
To get this right, you need to start moving
gradually upwards from the beginning of the

165
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,300
sentence.

166
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:53,110
Start with a falling-rising tone on although,
then move upwards in small steps.

167
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,660
Then, make a bigger move upwards on perfectly.

168
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:03,780
Although we hadn't planned everything perfectly...

169
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:09,260
Although we hadn't planned everything perfectly...

170
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,920
In the second half of the sentence, you need
to do the opposite.

171
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,180
You use a falling tone to show that your sentence
is finished.

172
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,290
So, expect needs a falling tone.

173
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,120
Again, start moving down in small steps from
the start of the clause.

174
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:31,100
Then, make a bigger move downwards on expect.

175
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,720
...it all went as smoothly as anyone could expect.

176
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,020
...it all went as smoothly as anyone could expect.

177
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,480
You need to think about two things here.

178
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,980
Firstly, your intonation should move on every
prominent word, but not on words which are

179
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,269
not prominent.

180
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:58,009
That means you need to move from low to high
on everything—not much, but a little bit.

181
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:04,100
You need to move from high to low on smoothly—again,
not a big movement.

182
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,089
Secondly, the last word of the clause should
have a much bigger movement.

183
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:16,550
On perfectly, you also move low to high, but
it’s a much bigger movement than on everything,

184
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,269
or other prominent words in the first clause.

185
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:22,470
The same is true in the second clause.

186
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,280
You need a much bigger intonation change on
expect.

187
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,180
Let's try the whole sentence.

188
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:37,580
Although we hadn't planned everything perfectly, it all went as smoothly as anyone could expect.

189
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,000
One more time.

190
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:48,860
Although we hadn't planned everything perfectly, it all went as smoothly as anyone could expect.

191
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,160
Remember that intonation is flexible.

192
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,999
If you change the prominent words, or emphasise
different points, then the intonation will

193
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,860
also change.

194
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,680
This is the basic, ‘neutral’ intonation.

195
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,420
Wow!

196
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,140
So much to think about for just one sentence.

197
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,600
Let’s look at one final point.

198
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,900
Linking means how you pronounce two words
together as one continuous sound.

199
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:24,579
For example, if one word ends with a consonant
sound, and the next word begins with the same

200
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:31,809
or a similar sound, you can link the sounds
together, like this: as_smoothly.

201
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:36,769
If one word ends with a consonant sound, and
the next word starts with a vowel sound, you

202
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:42,990
can link the sounds together, like this: planned_everything.

203
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,930
Can you find any other places in our sentence
where you could link words?

204
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,730
Pause the video and think about it.

205
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,889
You could also link:

206
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:57,290
it_all
went_as

207
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,680
as_anyone
could_expect

208
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:07,290
Generally, when you speak English, you should
connect words as much as possible.

209
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,129
Connecting words together will make your speaking
more fluent and natural-sounding.

210
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:15,189
Thinking about linking will help you to do
this.

211
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:20,959
Let’s practice reading the sentence again,
focusing on the links:

212
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:27,839
Although we hadn’t planned_everything perfectly,
it_all went_as_smoothly as_anyone could_expect.

213
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:34,140
One more time: Although we hadn’t planned_everything
perfectly, it_all went_as_smoothly as_anyone

214
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,199
could_expect.

215
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:40,459
You can see that there’s a lot to think
about when you pronounce even one sentence

216
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:42,139
in English!

217
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:47,110
Actually, there are even more points, but
the things you’ve seen in this lesson are

218
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,759
the most important.

219
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:53,670
If you can master these, your English will
sound clear, natural and fluent!

220
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,389
I have a question for you.

221
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,249
Which pronunciation point from the lesson
do you find most challenging?

222
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:02,999
