00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,060
Hi, I’m Gina.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,390
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:11,040
In this lesson, you can learn how to talk
about environmental issues in English.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,410
What’s the air quality like in your city?

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,680
Do you worry about climate change, or how
your food is produced?

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,200
You’ll learn how to talk about these, and
other topics in this class.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:30,500

fully-qualified teachers, who can help you

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:43,320
with your English speaking, writing, IELTS
preparation, or whatever else you need.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,480
Now, let’s look at our first topic.

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,580
Wow!

12
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,470
It’s such a beautiful day!

13
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,520
The sky is so blue.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,480
I guess...

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,320
It’s been nice all summer, so I don’t
notice it as much.

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,920
Maybe I’m getting spoiled!

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,940
I wasn’t expecting it to be like this.

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,530
My Dad came here a few years ago and he said
the air quality was really bad.

19
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,610
He’s not wrong.

20
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,460
It used to be terrible.

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,650
In summer, you’d often get thick smog covering
the whole city, but it’s improved greatly

22
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,710
in the last decade or so.

23
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,710
What changed?

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,100
I think it was driven by people’s attitudes.

25
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,960
Ten years ago, no one was interested in environmental
issues, but nowadays there’s much more awareness

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,700
of things like air quality and how it can
affect your health.

27
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,630
Sure, but that can’t be the only reason.

28
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,979
Well, no.

29
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:39,280
The local government also brought in new laws
and regulations.

30
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,229
They introduced restrictions on driving in
the city centre, made it illegal to use wood

31
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:49,549
or coal fires for heating, and moved a lot
of heavy industry away from the city.

32
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:55,110
Plus, there are much tighter regulations nationally,
too, like with car emissions: compared to

33
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,170
even ten years ago, cars are much cleaner.

34
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,950
It’s impressive that they could make such
a big change in a short time.

35
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,080
Ten years isn’t long for these things.

36
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,320
True, but there’s still more to do.

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,590
It can still get hazy in winter.

38
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,540
They’re investing in public transport infrastructure,
though, so I think it’ll carry on getting

39
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,540
better.

40
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:21,359
In your hometown, is the air quality good,
or do you have problems?

41
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:29,459
Can you remember any of the phrases you heard
in the dialogue to talk about air pollution?

42
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,220
You heard: ‘The air quality was really bad.’

43
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,739
‘You’d often get thick smog covering the

44
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,240
whole city.’

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,400
‘It can still get hazy in winter.’

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,420
‘Smog’ is a thick fog, caused by air pollution.

47
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,680
If the air is a little dirty, so that you
can’t see far, you might describe it as

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,640
‘hazy.’

49
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,340
'Air quality' is a useful phrase for this topic.

50
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,780
You can use it with different adjectives.

51
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,620
For example: 'The air quality is terrible'.

52
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,380
'The air quality is better than it was ten years ago'.

53
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,440
'The air quality is great for such a large city'.

54
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,480
Here’s a question: what do you think the
government, companies or individuals can do

55
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,320
to minimise air pollution?

56
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:33,599
In the dialogue, you heard several possible
solutions, such as: ‘The government brought

57
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,200
in new laws and regulations.’

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,360
‘They introduced restrictions on driving
in the city centre.’

59
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,500
‘They made it illegal to use wood or coal
fires for heating.’

60
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,960
‘They moved a lot of heavy industry away
from the city.’

61
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,230
‘Restrictions on driving’ could mean different
things.

62
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:05,589
For example, London has a congestion charge,
meaning that drivers have to pay every time

63
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:08,010
they enter the city centre.

64
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,379
Some cities have banned vehicles with diesel
engines, while others have created large pedestrian

65
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,440
zones.

66
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,180
Let’s practise!

67
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,610
Here are three questions for you.

68
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:26,560
One: what’s the air quality like in your
city?

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:35,850
Two: what is your local or national government
doing to improve air quality where you live?

70
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:43,870
Three: what do you think is the best way to
reduce air pollution?

71
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:49,070
Pause the video, think about your answers,
and write them down or say them out loud.

72
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,220
If you need more help, review the dialogue
and this section.

73
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,400
There are many words and phrases you can use.

74
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,560
Ready?

75
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,260
Let’s move on to our next point.

76
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:06,820
Whoa!

77
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,120
What are you doing?

78
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,180
What do you mean?

79
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,820
You can’t throw that in there!

80
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,820
Why not?

81
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,820
It’s garbage.

82
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,930
Yeah, but it’s recyclable.

83
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,320
It goes in the blue bin.

84
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,290
You mean, I have to put all recyclable stuff
in the blue bin?

85
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,490
Not all.

86
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,600
Plastics go in the blue bin, paper and card
in the brown bin, and bio-waste in the green

87
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,740
one.

88
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,500
‘Bio-waste?’

89
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:32,390
You know, food waste and stuff like that.

90
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,450
Is that it?

91
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,670
The black bucket is for glass and tins.

92
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,720
Do you not recycle?

93
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,700
In my hometown you can recycle a few things,
like glass, but we don’t sort our garbage

94
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,930
like this.

95
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,310
It seems very complicated!

96
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,150
Then what, all of your rubbish just goes into
landfill?

97
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,150
I guess…

98
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,860
I’ve never thought about it.

99
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,000
I just throw stuff away and forget about it.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,120
It was the same here not so long ago, but
now we’ve got used to sorting our rubbish

101
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,110
and recycling as much as possible.

102
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,630
It’s much more environmentally friendly.

103
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,610
I’m sure you’re right.

104
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,160
In the dialogue, we mentioned several different
types of garbage.

105
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,250
Quick question: can you remember three of
them?

106
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:24,700
By the way, the words ‘garbage’, ‘rubbish’
and ‘trash’ all have a similar meaning:

107
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,130
they all mean the stuff which you throw away.

108
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:35,030
If there is recycling in your city, you might
need to sort your recyclable garbage, meaning

109
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,720
you put different things in different bins.

110
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,600
Generally, you can sort garbage into recyclables
and non-recyclables.

111
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:53,500
Recyclable garbage might include glass, tins,
cans, paper, card, plastic, and bio-waste.

112
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,360
Waste which is not recycled is often sent
to landfill.

113
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:02,960
This means the waste is buried in a big hole
in the ground.

114
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,600
Sometimes, waste might end up in a dump.

115
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,280
A dump is like a landfill, but it isn’t
buried, so it’s just a big pile of garbage

116
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,990
on the ground somewhere.

117
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,570
Now it’s time for you to practise.

118
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,340
Here are another three questions for you:

119
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,450
In your city, do you sort your garbage?

120
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:29,610
If so, how?

121
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,940
What waste is commonly recycled in your country?

122
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:40,280
What happens to non-recyclable waste?

123
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,000
As before, pause the video and make your answers.

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,740
Practise them a few times before you continue.

125
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,120
Let’s look at our next topic.

126
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,370
That book looks interesting.

127
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,380
What’s it about?

128
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,380
This?

129
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,790
It’s by a Japanese writer.

130
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,520
It’s about farming and how we could make
farming more sustainable.

131
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,880
OK…

132
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,900
You’re a graphic designer.

133
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:10,710
Why are you reading about farming?

134
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,550
It’s interesting!

135
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,090
Farming produces the food you eat.

136
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,310
It’s not like it doesn’t affect you.

137
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,340
What’s his idea?

138
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,920
He’s basically saying that modern farming
methods can produce more in the short term,

139
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,590
but in the long term they degrade the land
and end up costing more.

140
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,590
Mmm…

141
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,960
One thing he talks about is pesticide use.

142
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,789
If farmers use pesticides and herbicides,
then they create an ecosystem which depends

143
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,999
on those artificial products, which are often
harmful for the environment.

144
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:43,610
If you grow food organically, using more traditional
farming methods, you can grow the same amount

145
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,380
of food without using pesticides at all.

146
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,389
So he thinks we should go back to mediaeval
farming or something?

147
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:51,660
Not exactly.

148
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,029
I can see you’re sceptical, but I think
you should read it, too.

149
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:56,879
It’s not just theory, by the way.

150
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,720
He’s used his ideas to set up several farms
in different countries, and they work just

151
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,059
like he says.

152
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,059
Hmm…

153
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:09,110
I have been thinking about these things, actually,
especially with meat.

154
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:15,190
I saw a documentary about livestock farming
and slaughterhouses, and it was shocking.

155
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:20,480
I guess most people just buy the food and
don’t think about where it comes from.

156
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,850
Right, so you’ll definitely like this book,
too.

157
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,550
You can borrow it once I’ve finished.

158
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,680
What’s it called?

159
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,880
“The One-Straw Revolution.”

160
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,900
Do you think about where your food comes from,
and how it’s produced?

161
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:40,220
Modern farming is heavily mechanised—it
depends heavily on machinery, automation,

162
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:45,860
as well as chemical products like herbicides
and pesticides.

163
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,180
Herbicides kill weeds, meaning unwanted plants.

164
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:56,720
Pesticides kill insects and small animals
which might try to eat food crops.

165
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,439
Farming needs to be sustainable.

166
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:03,499
‘Sustainable’ means that something can
continue.

167
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:11,939
For example, if you earn $1000 a month and
spend $2000, that isn’t sustainable.

168
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:17,389
Maybe you can do that for a few months, but
you can’t do it long term.

169
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:22,339
In the same way, some farming methods are
unsustainable.

170
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:29,480
In this case, farming can degrade the land,
meaning that, over time, it becomes more and

171
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,269
more difficult to grow anything.

172
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:36,889
On the other hand, some farming is organic.

173
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:44,720
‘Organic’ means that food is grown without
using any artificial chemical products.

174
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,519
Of course, farming isn’t just about growing
plants.

175
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:54,780
There is also ‘livestock farming’: raising
animals for meat, eggs or milk.

176
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:01,060
Animals which are raised to provide meat are
generally killed in a slaughterhouse.

177
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:03,180
What about in your country?

178
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,769
Think about these questions:

179
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:11,910
Are farms usually bigger and more mechanised,
or are they mostly smaller, using more traditional

180
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,540
methods?

181
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,840
Do you think it’s worth paying extra to
eat organic food?

182
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,860
Why or why not?

183
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,389
Is it important to know how your food is produced?

184
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:29,519
Give a reason!

185
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,560
Pause the video and think about your answers.

186
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,759
Write them down, say them out loud, or do
both.

187
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,460
Let’s look at our last section.

188
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,360
Do people ever talk about global warming in
your country?

189
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
For sure!

190
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,149
It’s a big issue.

191
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:54,449
We have a long coastline, and a lot of the
land is close to sea level, so the dangers

192
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:55,850
feel very real.

193
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,649
I feel like people often don’t pay attention
to these things until it’s too late.

194
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:02,300
It’s already happening, though.

195
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,230
There’s more flooding than there used to
be, and older people, like my grandparents

196
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:13,029
for example, all say that summers have got
much hotter than they were 50 years ago.

197
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,619
That’s kind of scary.

198
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:19,629
I read somewhere that even if we cut carbon
emissions to zero, global warming would continue

199
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:24,499
for at least fifty years, because of the greenhouse
gases that are already in the atmosphere.

200
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:27,839
The big topic for us is sea levels.

201
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,860
If the ice caps melt, they say sea levels
will rise by two or three metres.

202
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:39,059
For some countries, that wouldn’t be a big
deal, but we’d lose almost half of our land.

203
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,569
I don’t think any country will be immune
from the problems if it continues.

204
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:46,470
So, do you think there’s a solution?

205
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,119
It doesn’t look optimistic from what I’ve
heard.

206
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:55,179
I mean, people talk about things like carbon
taxes and reforestation programs, which are

207
00:12:55,179 --> 00:13:00,889
helpful, but I don’t think there’ll be
any real progress until there’s true international

208
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,689
cooperation.

209
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:06,990
So far, I don’t see any sign of that.

210
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,230
In the dialogue, you heard us talking about
climate change.

211
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:17,690
Can you remember phrases we used to describe
the causes and effects of climate change?

212
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:25,480
By the way, you can use the terms ‘global
warming’ or ‘climate change’.

213
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,959
People use them with the same meaning.

214
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,660
Climate change is caused by increasing levels
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

215
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,640
The main greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide,
or CO2.

216
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,800
Sometimes, instead of talking about carbon
dioxide or CO2, people will just refer to

217
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,120
‘carbon’.

218
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,160
You can hear things like: ‘We need to cut
carbon emissions significantly.’

219
00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,389
Climate change may lead to several problems,
particularly flooding caused by rising sea

220
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:02,119
levels.

221
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:08,119
Although there aren’t clear solutions, some
people suggest that carbon taxes or reforestation

222
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:12,239
programs are good ways to combat climate change.

223
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:17,600
A ‘carbon tax’ means that companies would
have to pay the government if their operations

224
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,640
released CO2 into the atmosphere.

225
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,660
Let’s see: can you use some of this language?

226
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,250
Here are three questions for you.

227
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,910
Are you worried about global warming?

228
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,320
Why or why not?

229
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:42,899
How would your country be affected if sea
levels rose significantly?

230
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:48,999
What do you think is the best way to deal
with climate change?

231
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:54,069
Pause the video and make your answers now!

232
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:55,139
How was that?

233
00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:00,699
There’s a lot of language in this lesson,
so don’t forget to review any sections that

234
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,119
were difficult for you.

235
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:09,279
Finally, we have a question for you: what’s
the biggest environmental issue in your country?

236
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:15,309
Let us know in the comments and practise talking
about these topics with other learners!

237
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:16,800
Thanks for watching!

238
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,610
See you next time!
