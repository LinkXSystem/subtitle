00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,600
Hi, I’m Justin.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,310
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,960
In this lesson, you can learn about using
the.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,290
What language do you speak?

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,250
If your language has a word like the, then
the isn’t too difficult.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,530
There are some small differences, but you
don’t have to think about it too much.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:26,210
However, if you speak a language which doesn’t
have a word like the, then learning how to

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,480
use the is a nightmare!

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,050
This lesson is made more for people whose
native language doesn’t have a word like

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:39,140
the, although we hope that speakers of all
languages will find it helpful.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,280
Learning about articles and the is the only
grammar topic I’ve seen which regularly

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,880
makes students angry.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,110
Any time I have to teach someone about articles,
I know they’re going to go through an angry

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,570
stage.

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,800
Why is this?

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,590
It’s because there are hundreds of rules
about using the.

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,040
Every rule has exceptions (of course, it’s
English!)

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,119
Sometimes, the rules overlap and you don’t
know which one to use.

19
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,070
We’re not going to try to cover all of the
rules in this class.

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,970
If you really want a headache, you can find
a grammar book and try to read and learn all

21
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,350
of them.

22
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,050
Instead of giving you rules which you can
read in a grammar book, we’re going to give

23
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,689
you some practical tips that we’ve used
with students and which work.

24
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:29,380
You’ll see six tips and one simple technique
you can use in your written English.

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,560
These tips and tricks are easy to remember
and use; you won’t need to study for hours

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,630
or memorise lots of complex rules.

27
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,979
Watch the video to the end, and you can start
using these ideas today.

28
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:49,430
Let’s start with a general question: what
does the mean?

29
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,630
Have you ever thought about this?

30
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,650
What does the mean?

31
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,110
What does it do?

32
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,630
If I say to you:

33
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,530
Show me the book.

34
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,619
What does the mean?

35
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,950
Why do I say the book and not a book?

36
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:13,950
The in this sentence shows that you—the
listener—know which book I’m talking about.

37
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,790
It shows that I’m talking about a specific
book, and I know you know which one I mean.

38
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:25,989
That’s what the means: it shows that you’re
talking about something specific.

39
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:31,000
You can think of the as a ‘pointing’ word,
like this or that.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,559
When you use the before a noun, you’re ‘pointing’
to a specific thing and saying, ‘that one’.

41
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:39,349
So that’s the basic meaning of the.

42
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:45,310
Keep this in mind, because it’s useful to
remember these basic points if things get

43
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,310
confusing.

44
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,280
Let’s see how you can use these ideas.

45
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,879
Let’s start with some examples:

46
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,170
Can you open the window, please?

47
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,989
Is that the woman you were telling me about?

48
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:06,120
The Taj Mahal is really worth going to see.

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,099
When you look at these sentences, they look
completely different, right?

50
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,980
But there is a connection.

51
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,069
Can you see the connection?

52
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:18,730
Think about why you use the in these sentences.

53
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:24,529
If I’m talking to you, in all of these three
situations, you know which one I mean.

54
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:30,769
For example, if you say, Can you open the
window, please, then we’re in the same room,

55
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:33,999
and it will be obvious which window you mean.

56
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:39,329
Sure, there are many windows in the world,
but if we’re in the same room, then we know

57
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,809
which window you’re talking about.

58
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:44,840
You can see the same idea in these sentences:

59
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,189
Where’s the bathroom?

60
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:51,079
I’m going to the shop.

61
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:56,699
In both of these cases, we use the because
it’s obvious which one you mean.

62
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:00,739
If you’re at someone’s house, and you
ask, Where’s the bathroom, we know which

63
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,180
bathroom you mean: the bathroom in the house
where you are/

64
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,889
If you say, I’m going to the shop, again
you mean that whoever you’re talking to

65
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:12,219
will understand which shop you mean.

66
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,949
Probably, you mean the local shop—one you
go to often.

67
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:18,530
Let’s look at our second sentence.

68
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:24,450
If I ask you, Is that the woman you were telling
me about, you know who I mean.

69
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,720
But here, the reason is different.

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,460
You know who I mean because we were talking
about her before.

71
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,570
You were telling me about her.

72
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,180
So, this is our second idea.

73
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,909
You can use the if the person you’re talking
to will remember which one you mean.

74
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:44,870
Here are a couple more examples of this:

75
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,000
What did you think of the film?

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,240
Do you remember the hotel we stayed at in
Berlin?

77
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,080
In both of these examples, you’re referring
to some kind of shared experience.

78
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,900
What did you think of the film?

79
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,290
--> Why do you use the?

80
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,840
Because you’re either talking about a film
we saw together, or a film we’ve talked

81
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,180
about before.

82
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,110
Either way, when you ask this, you use the
because the person you’re talking to will

83
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,970
know which film you mean.

84
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,070
Do you remember the hotel we stayed at in
Berlin?

85
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,520
--> We both stayed at the same hotel, so you
know which hotel I mean.

86
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,939
Okay, let’s come back to our third original
sentence.

87
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:33,600
If you say, The Taj Mahal is really worth
going to see, why do you use the?

88
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,540
It’s because there’s only one Taj Mahal.

89
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,680
We know which one you mean, because there’s
only one!

90
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,800
Let’s see some more examples of this idea:

91
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,440
The moon is so beautiful tonight!

92
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,689
It was the happiest day of my life.

93
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:55,449
In both of these examples, you use the because
you’re talking about one of something.

94
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:59,550
The person you’re talking to will know which
one you mean, because the thing you’re talking

95
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,389
about is unique.

96
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:06,099
The Earth only has one moon, so we say the
moon.

97
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:11,139
You can have many happy days in your life,
but only one can be the happiest, so you say

98
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:13,639
the happiest day of my life.

99
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:19,669
So, you’ve seen three important ideas about
using the in this section:

100
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:25,099
Use the for things around you, where it’s
obvious which thing you mean.

101
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:31,800
Use the to refer to shared experiences—things
you’ve talked about before or done together.

102
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,430
Use the when something is unique.

103
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,620
These are practical, general ideas which will
help you to use the correctly in English.

104
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:47,960
Next, let’s look at another simple rule
that can help you.

105
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,620
Here’s a good rule you can use, especially
in your written English.

106
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,409
If a noun is singular and countable, it needs
some kind of determiner.

107
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:01,759
A singular, countable noun can’t stand by
itself.

108
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,270
Okay, this isn’t specifically about using
the, because a determiner could be something

109
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:12,349
else, maybe a or this or that, or something
else.

110
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:18,569
But, it’s often helpful if you’re trying
to decide whether to use the or not.

111
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:21,949
Let’s look at an example:

112
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:26,779
Manager told us more about plan for New Year’s
party.

113
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,460
Maybe you can already see that this sentence
doesn’t look right.

114
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,550
Let’s apply our rule.

115
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,529
Can you remember it?

116
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:40,870
If a noun is singular and countable, then
it needs some kind of determiner, like the,

117
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,750
a, this, that, and so on.

118
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,069
So, look at our sentence.

119
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,699
How many nouns are there?

120
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:52,279
The first noun is manager.

121
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,949
Is this singular?

122
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:54,949
Yes.

123
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:56,259
Is it countable?

124
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:01,190
Let’s see: one manager, two managers, three
managers…

125
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,830
Yes, it’s countable.

126
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,260
So, it needs a determiner.

127
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,400
It can’t stand by itself.

128
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,710
Probably, whoever says this sentence knows
which manager they’re talking about.

129
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,309
That means we can use the.

130
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:16,729
What about plan?

131
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,039
Is it singular?

132
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,100
Is it countable?

133
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,660
Yes, and yes, so again, it can’t stay like
it is.

134
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,939
Here, we say that the manager told us more.

135
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:32,789
That means you already knew something about
this plan.

136
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,610
That means you can use the.

137
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,250
You know which plan the manager is talking
about.

138
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,690
What about New Year’s party?

139
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,690
Is it singular?

140
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,420
Is it countable?

141
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,320
Yes, and yes.

142
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,420
So, you need something.

143
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,310
How many New Year’s parties can there be
each year?

144
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:55,290
I mean, technically, you could have more than
one.

145
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,610
But generally, one company will just have
one New Year’s party.

146
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,040
If there’s just one, then you know which
one the manager’s talking about.

147
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,030
So again, you can use the.

148
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,890
The manager told us more about the plan for
the New Year's party.

149
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,639
Let’s do one more example:

150
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,240
Government should do more to help elderly
people.

151
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,810
Think about this sentence.

152
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,180
Where are the nouns?

153
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,020
Do they need determiners or articles?

154
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,920
Let’s use our test.

155
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,240
The first noun is government.

156
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,840
Is it singular?

157
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,340
Yes.

158
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,070
Is it countable?

159
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,180
One government, two governments…

160
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,680
Yes, it is.

161
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,500
So it needs a determiner.

162
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,430
Should we use the, or something else?

163
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,940
There are many governments in the world, but
whenever you talk about the government, you

164
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,300
mean ‘the government in your country.’

165
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,899
So, it’s clear which government you mean.

166
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:02,740
That means you can use the:
There’s one more noun: elderly people.

167
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,180
Is it singular?

168
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,180
No.

169
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,470
So, it doesn’t need a determiner.

170
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,360
It can stand by itself.

171
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,279
However, just because it doesn’t need one
doesn’t mean it shouldn’t have one.

172
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,920
You still need to think: should you say the
elderly people?

173
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,560
Here, you’re talking about elderly people
in general.

174
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,180
When you talk about things in general, you
don’t use the.

175
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,360
So the sentence is now correct.

176
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,950
The government should do more to help elderly
people.

177
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,430
The test that you’ve seen in this section
isn’t a magic spell.

178
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,910
You still need to think about where to use
the or not.

179
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,010
However, it’s simple and it does help.

180
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,720
Use this in your written English and you will
make fewer mistakes with the.

181
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,699
Trust me—we’ve seen this work for many
students.

182
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:57,600
Okay, so now you’ve seen some simple but
important ideas to help you decide when to

183
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,860
use the.

184
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,649
But, part of using the correctly is knowing
when not to use the.

185
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:09,199
So, let’s talk about that!

186
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:12,320
We just mentioned one case where you shouldn’t
use the.

187
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,940
Do you remember?

188
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,560
Don’t use the if you’re talking about
things in general.

189
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,490
For example:

190
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,940
Greek food is both healthy and tasty.

191
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,940
--> You’re talking about all Greek food,
in general.

192
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,860
I hate shopping for clothes.

193
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,730
--> I hate shopping for all clothes, all the
time.

194
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,310
I’m not talking about some specific clothes.

195
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,110
Football is more popular than basketball in
most countries.

196
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,389
--> Again, everything here is general.

197
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:50,740
You’re talking about football in general,
basketball in general, and countries in general.

198
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,899
Nothing is specific here.

199
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:56,319
So that’s your first important rule.

200
00:11:56,319 --> 00:12:00,750
Don’t use the if you’re talking about
things in general.

201
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,319
This is a really solid rule.

202
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:06,850
It works well, so you should definitely remember
it.

203
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:13,300
There’s another useful point here: don’t
use the with most names.

204
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:19,029
When we say ‘names’, we mean nouns that
you’d write with a capital letter.

205
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,040
This works most of the time.

206
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,329
There are a lot of exceptions, but if you
remember, ‘don’t use the with names’,

207
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,620
you’ll be right more often than not.

208
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,850
Obviously, if you know the detailed rules,
then that’s better.

209
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:40,220
However, if you’re in a situation where
you don’t know whether to use the or not,

210
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,350
then use this rule.

211
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,560
It works most of the time.

212
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,149
So, this means: don’t use the with people’s
names:

213
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:50,100
I met Jamie.

214
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,009
Don’t use the with names of cities or countries:

215
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:57,899
Stockholm is the capital of Sweden.

216
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,190
Don’t use the with names of streets or other
city features:

217
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,920
Queen’s Park is near Broad Street.

218
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,959
Don’t use the with the names of schools,
companies, universities or other institutions:

219
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,170
Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard to start
Microsoft.

220
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,110
I know what some of you are thinking…

221
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,779
What about The United States?

222
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:25,829
What about the Hilton?

223
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:26,920
What about…?

224
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,180
Yes, of course there are exceptions.

225
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,100
There are exceptions to everything!

226
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,230
That’s not the point.

227
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:40,010
Remember what we’re trying to do here: this
is a simple trick that you can carry in your

228
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,240
head and which is easy to use.

229
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,509
It will work most of the time.

230
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:50,260
There’s one more simple tip here: don’t
use the with another determiner.

231
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:59,600
Determiners include this, that, these, those,
possessive adjectives like my, your, his,

232
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:09,160
or her as well as quantifiers like many, much,
a lot of, each, every, and so on.

233
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,171
So you can’t use the in examples like:

234
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:15,740
I like this one more than that one.

235
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,800
Is this your bag or is it hers?

236
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,850
I want to spend lots of time with
every person here.

237
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,060
Okay, quick review:

238
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,230
- Don’t use the if you’re talking about
things in general.

239
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:37,069
- Don’t use the with most names (but remember
there are many exceptions to this).

240
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:41,120
- Don’t use the with another determiner.

241
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,460
From this lesson, you’ve got six rules:
three rules about when to use the, and three

242
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,320
rules about when not to use the.

243
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:56,860
You also saw a simple test to check if a noun
needs an article or not: is the noun singular?

244
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,100
Is it countable?

245
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:04,009
If yes and yes, it needs a determiner, possibly
the.

246
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:09,480
If you find it difficult to use the correctly,
take these six rules and this test, and try

247
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,329
using them.

248
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:15,410
We hope these tips are simple enough that
you can remember them and start using them

249
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,470
right now.

250
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,819
If you do, you will use the more accurately,
and you will make fewer mistakes.

251
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:27,230
Remember, these tips have helped many of our
students, and they can help you, too!
