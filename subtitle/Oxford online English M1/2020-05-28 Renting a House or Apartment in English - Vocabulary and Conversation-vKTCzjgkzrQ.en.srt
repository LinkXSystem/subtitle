00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,710
Hi, I’m Kasia.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,010
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,130
In this lesson, you can learn useful language
for renting an apartment or a house in English.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,640
Before we start, have you been to our website?

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,480
Go check it out: Oxford Online English dot
com.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,080
Do you find it difficult to listen to English
for long periods?

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,619
No problem – use the English subtitles to
help yourself understand!

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:32,020
Turn them on now; just click the ‘CC’
button in the bottom right of your video player.

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:38,880
Now, let’s look at the first step if you
want to rent a new place: phoning the estate

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,080
agent.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,960
Hello, Broom Cupboard Real Estate, how can
I help?

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,239
Hello, I’m looking to rent an apartment.

13
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,120
A friend of mine told me about your agency,
and I was hoping you could help me.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Of course!

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,449
Do you have a specific property in mind?

16
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:57,170
No, not yet.

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,610
No problem.

18
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,670
First question: do you know which area you’d
like to live in?

19
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,400
Well, I work in Cowley, so somewhere in the
east would make sense.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,670
Sure, and…

21
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,470
Are you looking to rent just for yourself?

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,700
I’m planning to share with a friend.

23
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,140
So, a two-bed?

24
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,060
Right.

25
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,980
And, do you have an idea of your budget?

26
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:23,240
You don’t have to be exact, but if you could
give me a range, that would be useful.

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,990
As cheap as possible, really.

28
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,740
I see…

29
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,840
Well, two-bedroom flats are generally around
eight to twelve hundred a month at the lower

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,700
end.

31
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,680
Hmmm…

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,160
OK.

33
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,790
One more important question: are you looking
for a furnished place?

34
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,860
Yes, furnished.

35
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,009
That’s fine.

36
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:44,240
Is there anything else you need?

37
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,680
For example, do you have pets?

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,220
Do you need a place with off-street parking?

39
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,780
Do you want a garden?

40
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,900
No, no pets.

41
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:55,281
I don’t have a car.

42
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,690
A garden would be a plus but it’s not necessary.

43
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,690
Got it.

44
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,930
I’ll take a look at what’s available and
get back to you in half an hour or so.

45
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,520
Can I just take a phone number…

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,640
Look at four questions you heard.

47
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,789
Can you remember how to complete these questions?

48
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:15,880
If you want, you can go back and watch the
dialogue again.

49
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,980
Ready?

50
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,660
Let’s see the full questions.

51
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,500
Next, do you remember the answers from the
dialogue?

52
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,960
Also, if you were answering these questions,
what would your answers be?

53
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,720
In the dialogue, you heard these answers.

54
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,959
Of course, you could give different answers.

55
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,800
For example: ‘I’m looking for something
in the northern suburbs.’

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,240
‘Yes, I’d like to rent a place just for
myself.’

57
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,300
‘My maximum is six hundred per month.’

58
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,260
‘No, I have furniture, so I’d like something
unfurnished.’

59
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:04,069
If you can talk about these ideas – area,
size, budget and whether you need a furnished

60
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:10,000
place or not – then you should be able to
tell an estate agent what you need in general

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,950
terms.

62
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,950
Try it!

63
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:18,500
If you were looking to rent an apartment – or
a house – what would you look for?

64
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,700
Try to make a few sentences describing what
you need.

65
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,030
Say your sentences out loud.

66
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,170
Pause the video and do it now!

67
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,360
How was that?

68
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,120
Remember that you can always review a section
if you need to.

69
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:42,020
Next, let’s see some useful language for
looking around a property.

70
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,300
Right, so this is the living room…

71
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,159
Is all the furniture included?

72
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,159
Most of it should be.

73
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,269
It’s possible that some items belong to
the current tenant, but I can send you a copy

74
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:55,010
of the inventory, so you can check for yourself.

75
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,519
That would be good.

76
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,200
The bathroom is through here.

77
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,680
It’s pretty mouldy…

78
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,280
Yes, it doesn’t look great, does it?

79
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
Don’t worry.

80
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,280
We’ll contact the landlord and make sure
that it’s dealt with before you move in.

81
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,880
I had a question: can we redecorate the place
ourselves, or paint a room, if we want?

82
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,040
Possibly, but you need the landlord’s permission
if you’re going to do anything which significantly

83
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,720
changes the appearance of the property.

84
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,250
Generally, landlords will be happy to let
you do things which improve the place.

85
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,710
I see…

86
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:35,250
Well, it looks OK, but there’s obviously
some work that needs doing.

87
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,390
The kitchen is filthy!

88
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,560
Yes, I understand.

89
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,350
It won’t be like that if and when you move
in.

90
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,020
If the current tenant doesn’t clean everything
thoroughly, we hire cleaners so that everything

91
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,270
is spotless for the new tenant.

92
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,270
OK.

93
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,460
Anyway, I’d like to take a couple of days
to think about it.

94
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,940
No problem, although if you’re interested,
I’d advise you to move quickly.

95
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,700
Places in this area get snapped up fast.

96
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,570
Let’s look at some key vocabulary from this
dialogue.

97
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,340
Could you explain what these words mean?

98
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,040
Or, can you guess the general meaning from
the context?

99
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,010
Think about it.

100
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:20,610
Before you move into a rented property, you’ll
do an inventory with the estate agent.

101
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,450
An inventory is a list of everything which
is in the apartment, and its condition.

102
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:32,070
If anything is damaged or dirty, you’ll
write it down on the inventory.

103
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:39,380
Then, when you move out, the estate agent
will check the property using the inventory.

104
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,090
If anything is missing or damaged, you’ll
usually have to pay for it.

105
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:50,440
Mould can be a problem in cold, damp countries
– like the UK!

106
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,100
Mould is something like a plant, which can
grow in dark, damp places, so it’s commonly

107
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,000
found in bathrooms.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,300
It can make your bathroom look bad, and smell
bad.

109
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,800
If you redecorate your home, you change and
improve how it looks.

110
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,480
Maybe you paint the walls a different colour,
or change the carpets, or add some ornaments.

111
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,180
‘Spotless’ means extremely clean.

112
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,460
You heard an adjective with the opposite meaning
in the dialogue – ‘filthy’, which means

113
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,100
‘extremely dirty’.

114
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,840
When the estate agent said ‘places in this
area get snapped up fast’, he meant that

115
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,420
there is high demand for apartments in this
neighbourhood.

116
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,810
‘Snap something up’ literally means to
eat something

117
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:43,250
very fast, like a crocodile; here it has the
meaning of getting something before anyone

118
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,480
else can.

119
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
What next?

120
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,490
Well, if you look around a property and you
like it, you’ll need to pay a deposit and

121
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,820
sign a tenancy agreement.

122
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,500
Let’s see how that works.

123
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,080
Hello, Broom Cupboard, Daniel speaking.

124
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,740
Hello, yes, this is … I’m calling about
the flat on Wesley Close?

125
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,740
Ah, yes!

126
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,740
Hello.

127
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,760
What can I do for you?

128
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,610
We’ve decided to go ahead.

129
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,240
We’ll take a 12-month lease.

130
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,800
That’s great!

131
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,050
So, what are the next steps?

132
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,130
The first thing is to pay a holding deposit.

133
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,520
It’s two hundred pounds, and that lets us
take the property off the market while we

134
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,430
process your application.

135
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,080
Do we get that back?

136
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,190
If your application is successful, then it’s
offset against your rental deposit, so generally

137
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,380
yes.

138
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,790
If your application is not successful, then
you won’t, but that’s rare.

139
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,980
What else do we need?

140
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:45,360
You need to supply at least two references,
either from landlords or from employers.

141
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,380
There are two of us; does that mean we need
two references each?

142
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,930
Yes, you do.

143
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,680
The sooner you can get them to us, the better,
but we must have them by the end of next week.

144
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,120
OK, that shouldn’t be a problem.

145
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,460
Anything else we need to do?

146
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,650
Not right now.

147
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,810
Once your application is processed, you’ll
need to pay the tenancy deposit and the first

148
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,250
month’s rent, and sign the agreement.

149
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,160
How much is the tenancy deposit?

150
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,720
It’s one month’s rent, so nine hundred.

151
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,310
So we need to pay eighteen hundred?

152
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,460
That’s right.

153
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,540
Right…

154
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,340
And, assuming everything goes smoothly, when
could we move in?

155
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,740
It really depends on you.

156
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,510
Once we get your references, we can have the
agreement drawn up within one working day.

157
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,700
Then, as soon as you sign it and make the
payment, we can give you the keys.

158
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,330
OK, well, thanks for your help.

159
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,610
I’ll try to get the references to you as
quickly as possible.

160
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:49,180
In your country, what do you need to do before
you can move into a rented house or apartment?

161
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,660
Of course, these things can be different depending
on where you live.

162
00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:01,490
In the UK, you generally have to pay a deposit,
pay the first month’s rent, provide references,

163
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,820
and sign a contract.

164
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:09,550
In most cases, you get your deposit back when
you move out, so long as you haven’t damaged

165
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,900
anything.

166
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:16,180
Once you’ve provided everything you need
to, you can sign the agreement, pick up the

167
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,940
keys, and move into your new place!

168
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:26,000
Now let's look at some questions:
Try to answer these questions by speaking

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,830
out loud, in full sentences.

170
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,120
Pause the video and do it now!

171
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,380
Could you do it?

172
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,620
If so, great!

173
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,890
If not, we suggest you review the dialogue,
and try again.

174
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,550
Try as many times as you need.

175
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:49,090
Finally, let’s imagine that you’ve come
to the end of your contract, and it’s time

176
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,520
to move out.

177
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
Hello?

178
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,460
Hi, it’s Daniel, from the real estate agency.

179
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,860
I just wanted to confirm a few details about
your moving out date?

180
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,330
Oh right, sure.

181
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:07,620
So, are you definitely planning to vacate
the property on the last day of your tenancy?

182
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,050
Probably one or two days earlier.

183
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,620
OK, no problem, but can you let us know when
you know for sure?

184
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,600
Yeah, can do.

185
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,410
Either when you move out or shortly afterwards,
we need to do the final inventory.

186
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,470
Do we have to be there for that?

187
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,560
No, but it’s advisable.

188
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,140
OK, what about our deposit?

189
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,520
When do we get that back?

190
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,970
Well, we need to do the inventory first, and
then you’ll get your deposit back within

191
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,860
about one week.

192
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,670
Have you read the information on our website
about cleaning?

193
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,680
No, I haven’t.

194
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,520
Well, you’re responsible for cleaning the
place before you leave.

195
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:49,770
If anything isn’t clean when we come to
check, we hire a cleaning company to come,

196
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,640
and the cost is taken out of your deposit.

197
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,740
I see.

198
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,740
One tip: pay extra attention to the oven.

199
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,170
It can be really difficult to get an oven
clean.

200
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,070
You might want to get a cleaner just to do
that.

201
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,290
It might be cheaper if you do it on your end,
rather than paying for our cleaning company.

202
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,680
OK, got it.

203
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,300
So, could we arrange a time for the final
inventory now?

204
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,490
I need to check my work schedule.

205
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,390
Let me call you back.

206
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,750
Look at some sentences from the dialogue.

207
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,880
Can you remember how to complete these sentences?

208
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,300
And, can you explain what they mean?

209
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,860
Let’s check the answers.

210
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,950
‘Vacate’ is a more formal word for ‘move
out’.

211
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,820
You can say ‘vacate the property’ or ‘move
out of the property’ – the meaning is

212
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,920
the same.

213
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,840
You learned about the final inventory earlier.

214
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,920
Do you remember what it means?

215
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,690
During the final inventory, the estate
agent will check that nothing has gone missing

216
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,430
or been damaged since you moved in.

217
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:02,090
In the UK, you need to clean a rented property
before you move out.

218
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,520
Is this the same in your country?

219
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,520
Finally, ‘the cost is taken out of your
deposit’ is another way of saying ‘you’ll

220
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,370
have to pay for this’.

221
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,360
You won’t get the full amount of your deposit
back.

222
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,960
Now, you should understand how to deal with
estate agents and rent an apartment or house

223
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,820
in English.

224
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,670
Have you had any interesting, funny or terrible
experiences when renting a place to live?

225
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,750
If you want to practise your English, please

227
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,990
Thanks for watching!
