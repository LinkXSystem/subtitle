00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,650
Hi, I’m Daniel.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,180
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,180
In this lesson, you can learn about the IELTS
B1 Life Skills exam.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:15,830
You’ll see what you need to do during the
IELTS Life Skills exam, and how you can make

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,020
sure you pass.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,859
The IELTS Life Skills exam has two levels:
A1 and B1.

7
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:27,009
In this lesson, we’ll focus on the B1 exam.

8
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:33,680
However, the tasks in the A1 exam are similar,
so a lot of the advice you’ll hear is useful

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,910
for both levels.

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,570
The B1 IELTS Life Skills exam lasts around
20 minutes.

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,199
You take the exam with one other candidate.

12
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:49,210
Sometimes, the examiner will ask you questions,
and sometimes you need to talk to your partner

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,480
and complete tasks together.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,079
IELTS Life Skills is a pass/fail exam.

15
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,820
You are assessed on four things:

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,910
Obtaining information
Conveying information

17
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,880
Speaking to communicate
And: Engaging in discussion

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:16,840
This means that Life Skills is a test of your
ability to communicate and understand others.

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,420
Your grammar, vocabulary, writing and so on
aren’t directly assessed.

20
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,840
It doesn’t matter if you make grammar mistakes
or if you don’t know some words so long

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,290
as you can communicate and express your ideas.

22
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:39,610
Let’s look at the different parts of the
IELTS Life Skills exam and what you need to

23
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,520
do.

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,580
At the beginning, the examiner will ask you
four questions:

25
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,860
What’s your name?

26
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,600
Can you spell it for me?

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,670
Where do you come from?

28
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,289
How long have you lived here?

29
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:04,260
These questions are the same in every exam,
so you can prepare your answers.

30
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,880
Use the introduction to warm up and get as
relaxed as possible.

31
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,700
Answer the questions in full sentences, make
eye contact, and be friendly.

32
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,360
This will help you to feel confident.

33
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,379
Next, the examiner will ask:

34
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:22,980
Could I have your marksheets?

35
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,129
Give the examiner your marksheet.

36
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:36,370
Then, the examiner will give you the instructions
for the first speaking task.

37
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,120
In this task, the examiner will give you a
topic.

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,900
Your job is to ask your partner questions
about the topic, and answer your partner’s

39
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,340
questions.

40
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:50,730
Here’s a sample task:

41
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,450
Now you are going to ask each other some questions.

42
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:00,250
I want you to find out from each other about
something you do in your free time, and why

43
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,930
you enjoy it.

44
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,090
You have two minutes to talk to each other.

45
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:13,920
Be careful: your job is not to talk about
the topic; it’s to ask questions.

46
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,050
The best way to do this task is to play “question
tennis.”

47
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,410
What am I talking about?

48
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:26,090
“Question tennis” means that your partner
asks you a question.

49
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,739
You answer, then you ask your partner a question
back.

50
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,760
Your partner answers, and then asks you a
question back.

51
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,549
For example:
What do you enjoy doing in your free time?

52
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:43,430
I like reading, going to the gym, and cooking.

53
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,430
What about you?

54
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,700
I’m a big sports fan.

55
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:53,150
I play football for a local team and I go
to watch matches most weekends, too.

56
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,280
Do you play any sports?

57
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Not really.

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,250
I like keeping fit, but I’m not into team
sports.

59
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,809
Do you enjoy playing football more, or watching
it?

60
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:07,140
Simple, right?

61
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:13,080
Answer a question, ask a question, answer
a question…

62
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,030
That’s it.

63
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,720
There are two things you need to be careful
of here.

64
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,880
One: don’t talk too long.

65
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,820
This task lasts two minutes, which is not
long.

66
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:33,130
Answer each question with one or two sentences,
and then ask the next question

67
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:39,900
Two: these tasks always have two parts.

68
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,980
For example:

69
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:48,380
Find out from each other about something you
do in your free time (1) and why you enjoy

70
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,390
it (2).

71
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:57,220
Or: Find out from each other about a place
you like to go (1), and what you like doing

72
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,040
there (2).

73
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,170
Listen carefully to the examiner and make
sure you understand both parts of the

74
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,170
question.

75
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,080
If you’re not sure, ask!

76
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,960
It doesn’t make a difference to your result.

77
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,690
Then, cover both parts of the question during
the task.

78
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:22,720
Keep asking and answering questions until
the examiner stops you.

79
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:30,660
The examiner will then give you the instructions
for the next task.

80
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:37,800
In this part of the Life Skills test, you
and your partner are given two different topics.

81
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,900
You have to talk about your topic for one-and-a-half
minutes.

82
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,470
Then, your partner will ask you three questions
about what you said.

83
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,350
Your partner will talk about their topic in
the same way.

84
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,830
You need to listen and ask them three questions
afterwards.

85
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,520
Here’s a sample task:

86
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,870
You’re going to tell your partner about
something you’d like to learn to do, and

87
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,530
why you’d like to learn this.

88
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,960
You get one minute to think about what to
say.

89
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,200
You can also use this time to ask the examiner
if anything is not clear.

90
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:27,490
As before, these tasks always have two parts
Also, your job is to talk about one thing.

91
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,560
Don’t talk about several things you’d
like to learn to do.

92
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,080
Choose one thing and talk about it.

93
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:42,470
This is generally true; these tasks always
ask you to talk about one thing.

94
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,280
If anything is not clear, ask the examiner.

95
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,990
Again, it doesn’t matter if you need to
ask.

96
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:55,350
However, if you don’t understand the task,
and you talk about the wrong thing, that is

97
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,240
a problem.

98
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,910
You have 90 seconds to speak.

99
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:06,830
You should try to continue speaking until
the examiner stops you.

100
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,150
Start your speech with a simple introduction,
stating your topic.

101
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,770
For example:

102
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,990
I’d like to learn to paint.

103
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:23,810
Then, add more details, making sure you cover
both parts of the question.

104
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,340
You can prepare for this part of the test
by practicing with a timer.

105
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,960
Set the timer on your phone for 90 seconds.

106
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,620
Take a topic, like this one,
and try to speak for the full 90 seconds.

107
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:44,010
If you’re watching this lesson on YouTube,
you can find more sample questions to practice

108
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,720
with on our website.

109
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,870
There’s a link under the video.

110
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:55,970
When your partner is speaking, listen carefully
and think of questions you could ask.

111
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,760
You need to think of three questions.

112
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,120
Here are two tips:

113
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,020
One: keep your questions simple.

114
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,680
Two: make sure you’re asking for new information.

115
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,650
For example, if your partner says, “I first
went to Paris last year,” don’t ask, “When

116
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,480
did you first go to Paris?”

117
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,400
Ask for some new information.

118
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,000
For example:

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,340
What did you do in Paris?

120
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,140
What did you like best about Paris?

121
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,820
Are you planning to go to Paris again?

122
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:41,510
When your partner asks you questions, you
should also keep your answers simple and direct.

123
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:47,830
Answer with one or two full sentences; don’t
speak for a long time.

124
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:55,630
Next, you’ll do the listening section.

125
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:02,180
During the listening part of the IELTS Life
Skills exam, you’ll hear two short recordings.

126
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:09,300
The examiner will then ask you a multiple-choice
question about one of the recordings.

127
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,650
For example, the question might be:

128
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:17,220
In the first recording, where are the people
planning to go?

129
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,060
You’ll have a choice of three answers.

130
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,810
Then, you’ll hear the recordings again.

131
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:33,050
The examiner will ask you two questions about
the other recording.

132
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:39,250
That means: if your first question is about
the first recording, the examiner will ask

133
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,170
you about the second recording.

134
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:48,240
So, the first time you hear the recordings,
listen to both as carefully as possible.

135
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,250
The second time, focus on the recording which
the examiner didn’t ask you about.

136
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:01,150
Here’s an example of the kind of question
you might hear:

137
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:06,450
In the second recording, how are they planning
to get to the concert?

138
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,770
And what time are they going to meet?

139
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,220
Answer the questions with full sentences.

140
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,900
If you don’t know, take a guess.

141
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,690
The recordings and questions are relatively
simple.

142
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:25,600
Even if you guess, you have a chance to get
lucky and get the right answer!

143
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:34,800
Next, the examiner will introduce the next
activity: planning.

144
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,520
The planning section is not difficult, but
it’s the part which IELTS Life Skills candidates

145
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,890
have the most problems with, so it needs your
attention!

146
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,440
Let’s look at a sample question.

147
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,060
The examiner will say, “Now, you’re going
to plan something together.

148
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,350
I’d like you to imagine that you’re organising
a party for your friends.

149
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:04,220
First, talk together about where you should
have the party and choose the one you think

150
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,340
would be best.”

151
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,820
You’ll see something like this:
- in a restaurant

152
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:17,460
- at someone’s home
- in a bar or café

153
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:26,460
Next, the examiner will continue, “Then,
plan and decide what to do about these things.”

154
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,840
The examiner will show you something like
this

155
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,680
:
- what food and drink to have

156
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:39,080
- how many people to invite
- what games or activities to have

157
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:45,920
Then, the examiner says, “You have two minutes
to talk about this, so don’t worry if I

158
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,130
interrupt you.”

159
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:54,670
Here’s the first thing you need to do: when
you hear the examiner say this, you need to

160
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,310
start immediately.

161
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,950
Your time for this activity is very limited.

162
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,120
Don’t repeat parts of the task.

163
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,930
Don’t say something like:

164
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,130
So, we’re going to organize a party.

165
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,250
I think it’ll be fun!

166
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,110
This just wastes your time.

167
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,860
Start answering the first question.

168
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,950
Make a suggestion; for example:

169
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:26,700
I think we should have the party in a bar,
because it’ll have a better atmosphere.

170
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,990
What do you think?

171
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:37,000
If you can’t think of anything to say, just
ask your partner a question, like this:

172
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,820
So, where should we have the party?

173
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:49,570
The planning activity has two parts: the first
question, and the ‘plan and decide’ section,

174
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:54,400
which has three points to discuss.

175
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,880
You want to answer the first question quickly,
in 30 seconds or so.

176
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,390
This will give you enough time for the plan
and decide section.

177
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:11,500
If your partner makes a suggestion for the
first question, just agree with them.

178
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,070
It doesn’t matter if you actually agree
or not.

179
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,160
Say something like:

180
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,130
Yes, that’s a good idea.

181
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,200
You’re right; we should do that.

182
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,240
It doesn’t matter if you don’t finish
everything, but you should try to cover as

183
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,750
much as you can.

184
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:39,110
Because your time is so limited, it’s important
to move the conversation forward.

185
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,410
Don’t get stuck on one point.

186
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:46,220
If you’ve been on one point for too long,
say something like:

187
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,060
Let’s think about what food and drink to
have.

188
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,030
Anyway, how many people do you think we should
invite?

189
00:13:54,030 --> 00:14:01,800
There’s one more thing to talk about: what
games or activities should we have?

190
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:08,460
This brings us to another important point:
you and your partner need to plan one thing

191
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,930
together.

192
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,510
That means you can’t decide to do something
different to your partner.

193
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:21,810
You’re planning one party in this question,
so you need to plan one event, in one place.

194
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:26,270
You can’t make two separate plans.

195
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:30,400
This is easy: whatever you’re planning,
it’s not real.

196
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,290
If your partner suggests something, you can
just agree with them.

197
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:39,600
It doesn’t matter if you really agree or
not.

198
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:46,029
Try to balance making your own suggestions,
and asking your partner for their opinion.

199
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:48,610
For example:

200
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,370
I think we should invite around 20 people.

201
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,950
That’s enough to have fun, but not too big.

202
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,920
What do you think?

203
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,190
Let’s review the most important points here:

204
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:07,280
One: start answering the first question immediately.

205
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,440
Aim to agree an answer as fast as you can.

206
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,970
Two: move the conversation forward, and don’t
stay on one point for long.

207
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:24,650
Three: make sure you plan together and reach
an agreement with your partner.

208
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:30,560
The examiner will probably stop you before
you’ve finished, but that’s okay.

209
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,980
Now, you have one more activity to do.

210
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:43,020
In the last part of the IELTS Life Skills
exam, the examiner gives you a more open topic.

211
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,190
You and your partner need to discuss the topic
for four minutes.

212
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,440
Let’s look at a sample question:

213
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,240
Now, we’re going to talk together about
food and cooking.

214
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:03,500
Find out from each other what kind of food
you like, and what you can cook.

215
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,380
Do you notice anything in the task?

216
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,720
Like the first speaking task, the question
has two parts.

217
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,180
This is true of all questions in this section;
there are always two parts.

218
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,500
Make sure you understand both parts.

219
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,990
If you don’t, ask!

220
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:30,110
So, what should you do here?

221
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,140
The best way is to play “question tennis”
again.

222
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,210
However, in this activity, you have a bit
more time.

223
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:43,770
That means you can make your answers a little
longer and give a bit more information.

224
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:48,750
For example:
So, what’s your favourite food?

225
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:55,030
I really like all kinds of Asian food: Indian,
Thai, Chinese, anything like that.

226
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,210
I particularly like Thai food.

227
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,860
As you might have guessed, I’m a big fan
of spicy food!

228
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,860
What about you?

229
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,490
My mother’s Italian, so I would say Italian
food.

230
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,120
I spent a lot of time in Italy when I was
growing up, and there are some dishes which

231
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,890
just make me feel happy.

232
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:17,190
It’s not just about the flavour; they bring
back happy memories for me!

233
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,360
Do you like Italian food, or is it not spicy
enough for you?

234
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,670
I do like Italian food, although it needs
to be cooked right.

235
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,520
I like most cuisines, to be honest.

236
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,460
Plus, I enjoy trying new kinds of food.

237
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,120
What about cooking: do you enjoy cooking?

238
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,809
You can see that it’s quite similar to the
first speaking activity: answer your partner’s

239
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,470
question, then ask a question back.

240
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:49,410
Try to give a little more detail in your answers
here, but make sure you stay on topic!

241
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:56,050
Even here, you don’t have so much time,
so you shouldn’t talk for too long.

242
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,400
Make sure you ask questions to cover both
parts of the task.

243
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,250
Just keep asking and answering questions until
the examiner stops you.

244
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,470
And, that’s it!

245
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,580
You’ve finished your IELTS Life Skills exam.

246
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:17,000
Are you planning to take the IELTS Life Skills
exam soon?

247
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,130
Have you taken it recently?

248
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,870
We’d love to know your results!

249
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:27,220
