00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,420
Hi, I’m Daniel.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,960
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,860
I’ve got a challenge for you.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,830
Read this sentence aloud, as fast as you can:
‘The Worcestershire rural brewery queue

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,400
is the sixth longest in the world.’

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,020
Let’s try again: ‘The Worcestershire rural
brewery queue is the sixth longest in the

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,010
world.’

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,400
Could you read the sentence quickly and fluently?

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,090
There are many difficult words to pronounce
in this sentence.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:41,579
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to pronounce
these and other difficult words in English.

11
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,760
You’ll see what makes some words difficult
to pronounce in English, and how you can train

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,280
your pronunciation so that you can pronounce
all of these words easily!

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,040

We have many qualified, professional teachers
who you can choose from.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,700
But now, let’s get back to our difficult
sentence.

18
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,480
Say ‘word’.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,840
Now, say ‘world’.

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,919
Many English learners can say ‘word’ easily,
but ‘world’ is more difficult.

21
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:37,130
Why?

22
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:45,660
The only difference between the words is the
/l/ sound: ‘word’, ‘world’.

23
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,869
Actually, the /l/ makes a big difference.

24
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:52,569
Let’s see why.

25
00:01:52,569 --> 00:02:01,029
To say /l/, you probably know that your tongue
needs to touch the top of your mouth: /l/.

26
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:05,869
However, there are different ways to pronounce
/l/.

27
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:11,540
You can use the tip of your tongue or the
blade (the wider part).

28
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:18,409
You can touch the top of your mouth just behind
your teeth, or you can touch further back.

29
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:22,420
Different languages produce /l/ sounds slightly
differently.

30
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,630
The English /l/ is pronounced using the tip
of your tongue, touching near the front of

31
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:36,600
your mouth—just above and behind your top
teeth—like this: /l/ /l/

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,690
For most English words, it doesn’t matter
so much how you pronounce /l/.

33
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:49,620
However, if you produce /l/ differently from
a native speaker, you’ll have problems with

34
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,049
‘world’.

35
00:02:52,049 --> 00:03:01,040
To say world, first say /w/ and /ɜː/: /wɛː/
/wɛː/

36
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,220
When you pronounce /ɜː/, your tongue should
be fairly relaxed, sitting in the middle of

37
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,540
your mouth.

38
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:17,380
Next, the tip of your tongue moves up and
touches the top of your mouth just above and

39
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,160
behind your top teeth.

40
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,820
Don’t pull your tongue too far back.

41
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,440
If you do, you won’t be able to move between
the two sounds.

42
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:37,650
You’ll pronounce it something like this:
Don’t do this!

43
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,769
Remember, just use the tip of your tongue,
and move it slightly upwards to touch the

44
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,960
top of your mouth: ‘world.’

45
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,299
If you get it right, your tongue should be
in the right position to pronounce the /d/

46
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,299
sound without moving.

47
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:02,480
This means you can move smoothly between /l/
and /d/.

48
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,760
If you have to move your tongue between /l/
and /d/, then your tongue is probably too

49
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,279
far back.

50
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:14,650
Try saying the /d/ sound.

51
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,700
Can you feel where your tongue is?

52
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:25,699
This is where your tongue should be to pronounce
/l/: ‘world’.

53
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,810
‘World’.

54
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:36,880
When you say the word correctly, it’s a
very small movement between /ɜː/, /l/ and

55
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,350
/d/.

56
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,060
Try one more time: ‘world’.

57
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,140
‘World’.

58
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,150
How’s that?

59
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,260
Can you do it at natural speed?

60
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,640
‘World’.

61
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,640
‘World’.

62
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,680
Don’t worry if you can’t pronounce it
correctly straight away.

63
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,370
Start by pronouncing it really slowly, one
sound at a time.

64
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,420
Focus on the movement between /ɜː/, /l/
and /d/.

65
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:20,760
Remember that your tongue should not move
at all between /l/ and /d/.

66
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,260
When the movements are correct and comfortable
for you, try saying it faster.

67
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,099
Here are some other words you can practise
with.

68
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:38,520
These words have the same sound combination:
‘curled’.

69
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,360
‘hurled’
‘unfurled’

70
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,160
OK, one down.

71
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,160
What’s next?

72
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:58,180
Ordinal numbers, like fifth, sixth or eighth
can be especially difficult to pronounce for

73
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,669
non-native speakers.

74
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:02,659
Why is that?

75
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:07,460
In all of these words, you have a lot of consonants
together.

76
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:15,260
Listen and look at the phonetics: ‘fifth’
‘sixth’

77
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,800
‘eighth’
In particular, you have to combine different

78
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,480
consonants with the /θ/ sound.

79
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:32,080
First of all, you should be comfortable with
the /θ/ sound before you practise this.

80
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:40,169
Say this sentence: ‘Both therapists think
Theo’s teeth are thoroughly filthy.’

81
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:43,140
Can you pronounce /θ/ easily?

82
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:49,260
If not, pause the video, practise this sentence,
and focus on /θ/.

83
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:54,560
Read the sentence slowly, and make sure your
tongue is between your teeth

84
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,789
every time there’s a /θ/ sound.

85
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:05,349
If you’re OK with the /θ/ sound, then let’s
look at how you can combine /θ/ with other

86
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:07,020
consonants.

87
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,000
We’ll start with ‘fifth’.

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,490
‘Fifth’
Can you work out what’s happening here?

89
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:23,550
As you release the /f/ sound, your tongue
needs to move between your teeth to produce

90
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,600
the /θ/ sound.

91
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,700
The two movements—releasing the /f/ and
pronouncing the /θ/--need to be very close

92
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,180
together.

93
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,490
There shouldn’t be any gap between them,
otherwise you’ll add a vowel sound and pronounce

94
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,620
the word incorrectly.

95
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,200
Try it slowly.

96
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:54,460
First, start to say fifth, but stop on the
second ‘f’, and hold the /f/ sound: /fɪfffffffff/

97
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:05,460
Here, you’re making the /f/ sound with your
top teeth and your bottom lip: /fɪfffffffff/

98
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:14,900
Next, you /f/ by pulling your bottom lip down,
and at the same time you push your tongue

99
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:20,980
forward so it’s between your teeth, and
pronounce /θ/: ‘fifth’

100
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:30,940
‘Fifth’
Remember, if it’s difficult, start slowly

101
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,240
and focus on producing the movements accurately.

102
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:42,010
When it’s easier, try at a more natural
speed: ‘fifth’

103
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:48,720
‘Fifth’
OK, but what about sixth?

104
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,370
The sound combination is different, but the
principle is the same.

105
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,080
Look at the phonetics for sixth.

106
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,050
You need to move from /s/ to /θ/ very quickly,
without relaxing.

107
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,830
First, pronounce /s/.

108
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:11,880
Try to hold the sound.

109
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,940
Where’s your tongue?

110
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,950
It’s just above and behind your top teeth.

111
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:25,310
To move from /s/ to /θ/, your tongue needs
to slide forward

112
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:30,940
and end between your teeth.

113
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,560
Your tongue should be touching the top of
your mouth the whole time.

114
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,620
Don’t relax and let your tongue move away
from the top of your mouth.

115
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:45,600
Otherwise, you’ll add a vowel sound and
mispronounce the word.

116
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,960
Try it slowly.

117
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:57,380
Say and hold /s/, then slide your tongue forward
to pronounce /θ/, like this: /sθ

118
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,030
/sθ/
Practice this a few times until you can make

119
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,840
the movement comfortably.

120
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:14,860
Next, let’s try the full word: ‘sixth’
‘Sixth’

121
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:22,380
Let’s try at full speed: ‘sixth’
‘sixth’

122
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,840
Can you pronounce the sound combinations correctly?

123
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:31,830
Remember, start slowly and train the movements.

124
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,220
What about ‘eighth’?

125
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,320
It’s the same idea.

126
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,280
Think about what happens when you say /t/.

127
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,890
You put your tongue above your top teeth,
you build pressure, then you move your tongue

128
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:52,740
to release the pressure and release the sound:
/t/.

129
00:10:52,740 --> 00:11:00,180
Normally, after you say /t/, your tongue relaxes
and finishes in the middle of your mouth.

130
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:07,960
When you say ‘eighth,’ instead of relaxing
your tongue, you need to release the /t/ so

131
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:13,900
that your tongue finishes between your teeth
and you can say /θ/.

132
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:20,620
A good way to think about this: imagine you
want to ‘catch’ the /t/ sound between

133
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,450
your teeth.

134
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:28,300
Let’s try slowly: ‘eighth’.

135
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,900
‘Eighth’.

136
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:37,050
Remember, you want your tongue to go directly
from /t/ to /θ/.

137
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,790
Don’t let your tongue relax or pull back.

138
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:48,950
Let’s try at natural speed: ‘eighth’
‘Eighth’.

139
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:55,170
With all these words, start slowly and train
the movements.

140
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:01,620
When you are comfortable with the movement,
then you can try going faster.

141
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,220
On the other hand, if you can’t pronounce
it correctly, slow down!

142
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,670
Get the sounds right first.

143
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,840
You can work on speed later.

144
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,880
Now, let’s look at our next word.

145
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,620
Can you say ‘rural brewery’?

146
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:28,500
Many English learners say that these are some
of the most difficult English words to pronounce

147
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,810
correctly.

148
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,770
So, what makes these words difficult?

149
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:41,480
Listen and look at the phonetics: ‘rural’,
‘brewery’.

150
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:49,510
The combination of /r/ with the /ʊə/ vowel
sound is the problem here.

151
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:54,750
Remember in part one we talked about /l/ sounds?

152
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,100
You saw that there are different ways to produce
/l/.

153
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,320
/r/ is the same.

154
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,910
There are many ways to say /r/.

155
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:11,630
For example, in Spanish—and many other languages—/r/
is produced by touching your tongue to the

156
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,510
top of your mouth.

157
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,410
The English /r/ is produced differently.

158
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:23,300
To say ‘rural brewery’, you need to produce
/r/ in the English way.

159
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,010
Otherwise, you’ll have a really bad time
trying to say the words.

160
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,880
It will make you angry.

161
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,770
So, let’s see how to pronounce /r/.

162
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,020
First, say /w/.

163
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,120
If possible, practise with a mirror.

164
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,160
You see the way your lips move?

165
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:50,140
Your lips start closed, and then open to make
the /w/ sound: /w/

166
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,570
/w/.

167
00:13:51,570 --> 00:14:02,740
Next, try to curl your tongue up and back,
towards the back of your mouth, like this:

168
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,940
Very important: your tongue does not touch
anything.

169
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,470
It curls towards the top of your mouth, but
it doesn’t touch the top of your mouth at

170
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,370
all.

171
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,300
You can also pull the back of your tongue
up towards the top of your mouth.

172
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:25,200
It doesn’t matter whether you use the tip
of your tongue or the back; you just need

173
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:31,760
to pull your tongue towards the top of your
mouth, but without touching it.

174
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:40,290
So, let’s go back to where we were: you’re
trying to make a /w/ sound, but with your

175
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,030
tongue pulled back and towards the top of
your mouth.

176
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,170
Your tongue should be tense.

177
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:52,310
Do all of this and try to make a /w/ sound.

178
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:58,900
If your tongue is in the right place, it will
be difficult to say /w/ cleanly.

179
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,970
You’ll produce a sound between /w/ and /r/.

180
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:10,950
Get your tongue in the right place, then try
saying /r/ with a small movement of your lips:

181
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,880
/r/
/r/.

182
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,620
So, why are we doing all this?

183
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:23,570
To say ‘rural’ or ‘brewery’ fluently
and correctly, you need to say them without

184
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,920
moving your tongue--except at the end of ‘rural’
where your tongue moves forward to pronounce

185
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,660
/l/.

186
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
This is the secret.

187
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:38,560
If you move your tongue around, you won’t
be able to connect the sounds smoothly.

188
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:47,240
In both words, your tongue stays pulled back,
and your lips do most of the work.

189
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,250
However, your lips also shouldn’t move too
much.

190
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:57,420
If you open your mouth wide, it’ll be hard
to pronounce the words.

191
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,770
You need to make small, minimal movements:
‘rural’.

192
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,920
‘rural’.

193
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,790
Do you see how little my lips move?

194
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:14,770
Remember, your tongue needs to be pulled back
and tense through the whole word, until you

195
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,060
move forwards to pronounce /l/ at the end.

196
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:25,440
To help you, let’s see how to pronounce
the word one sound at a time.

197
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:32,640
Pronounce /r/ with your lips, moving onto
the round shape of /ʊ/, like this: /rʊ/

198
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,040
/rʊ/

199
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,220
Relax the /ʊ/ sound to produce a schwa, but
don’t move your lips too far: /rʊə/

200
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,300
/rʊə/

201
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:50,410
Bring your lips together again, keeping your
tongue pulled back, to produce another /r/

202
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,470
sound.

203
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:57,480
Then relax to pronounce the second schwa,
then move your tongue forwards to pronounce

204
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,290
/l/: ‘rural’.

205
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,290
Can you do it?

206
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,900
Try it slowly: ‘rural’.

207
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,880
Now let’s try a little faster: ‘rural’.

208
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,280
‘Rural’.

209
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:17,189
What about brewery?

210
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:19,389
You can use the same techniques.

211
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:24,280
You need to move from /r/ to /ʊə/ and then
back to /r/ again.

212
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:30,750
Again, you need to keep your tongue pulled
back, and use small lip movements to produce

213
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,900
the sounds: ‘brewery’.

214
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,419
‘Brewery’.

215
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:43,659
If it’s difficult, you need to practice
the /rʊər/ sound combination some more.

216
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:49,139
Go back to ‘rural’ and practise the steps
to combine these sounds.

217
00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:51,180
If it’s easy, great!

218
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:56,600
Let’s try at natural speed: ‘brewery’.

219
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,320
‘Brewery’.

220
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,400
Got it?

221
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,680
Let’s move on!

222
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,120
Actually, ‘queue’ isn’t difficult to
pronounce: /kjʊː/

223
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,730
But, many English learners mispronounce it.

224
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,730
Why?

225
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:19,639
It’s because the spelling and the pronunciation
are so different.

226
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:21,980
English is not a phonetic language.

227
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,679
The same letter can make different sounds
in different words, and different letters

228
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,809
can have the same sound.

229
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:37,440
However, ‘queue’ is an extreme example,
which is why many English learners get confused

230
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,330
and make mistakes.

231
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:44,990
Remember: letters and sounds are not the same
thing in English!

232
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,630
English spelling is not your friend.

233
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:53,600
The spelling does not necessarily tell you
how to pronounce a word, and in many cases

234
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,120
it can be actively confusing.

235
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,200
What other words are like this?

236
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:07,490
The words ‘choir’ and ‘thoroughly’
are good examples, but there are many more.

237
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,169
What can you do?

238
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:15,390
You have two choices: you can complain and
make yourself angry at how illogical English

239
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:20,360
spelling is, or you can learn phonetics.

240
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,919
Remember that in these words, the pronunciation
itself is not generally difficult.

241
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,809
If you have a problem, it’s almost always
because the spelling is confusing.

242
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:38,620
Unlike English spelling, phonetics are logical
and regular.

243
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,029
Phonetics will never lie to you.

244
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:42,679
Learn phonetics!

245
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:45,429
Or just get angry and complain.

246
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:47,120
Your choice!

247
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,580
Let’s look at one last thing.

248
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:59,610
Similar to part four, the pronunciation of
‘Worcestershire’ isn’t so difficult,

249
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:07,240
but the spelling and pronunciation are not
closely connected: ‘Worcestershire’.

250
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,509
In particular, the word Worcestershire has
a lot of silent letters.

251
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:18,570
In fact, it’s only three syllables: /'wʊ-stə-ʃe/

252
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:24,409
Many English place names are like this: the
pronunciation can be difficult to guess from

253
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:26,280
the spelling.

254
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,460
For example, how would you pronounce these
place names?

255
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,220
Pause the video and think about it if you
want.

256
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,110
Ready?

257
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,840
Let’s check: ‘Leicester.’

258
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,400
‘Salisbury’.

259
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,320
‘Warwick.’

260
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,460
‘Berkshire’.

261
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,629
Did you guess the correct pronunciations?

262
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:58,350
Again, you can see that the pronunciation
doesn’t match the spelling at all.

263
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,779
Don’t worry if this is confusing.

264
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:07,720
Many visitors from to the UK from other English-speaking
countries also find it difficult!

265
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,179
Do you remember the sentence from the beginning
of the lesson?

266
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:19,070
‘The Worcestershire rural brewery queue
is the sixth longest in the world.’

267
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,950
Try saying it.

268
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,769
Has your pronunciation improved?

269
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:25,340
I hope so!

270
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,760
If not, just keep practising.

271
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,440
It can take time to get better.

272
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,720
What other English words do you find especially
difficult to pronounce?

273
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,160
Let us know in the comments, and maybe they’ll
appear in a future video!

274
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,809
Thanks for watching!

275
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:44,519
See you next time!
