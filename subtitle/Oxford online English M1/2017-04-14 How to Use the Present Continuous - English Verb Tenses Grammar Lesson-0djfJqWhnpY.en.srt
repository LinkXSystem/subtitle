00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,600
Hello, I’m Jack.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,870
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:13,179
In this lesson, you can learn about the present
continuous verb tense in English.

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:18,510
We'll talk about all the possible meanings
of the present continuous; whether you’re

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,320
a beginner or an advanced learner, you’re
sure to find something new.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,750
So, let's get into it!

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,489
First, how can you form the present continuous?

8
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,370
To form the present continuous, you use:

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,649
'be + verb + -ing'

10
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:44,050
For example:

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,469
He’s washing his car.

12
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:52,640
They’re watching a film.

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,109
What about negatives and questions?

14
00:00:55,109 --> 00:01:01,750
To make negatives, add 'not' after 'be'.

15
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,859
She isn’t doing anything.

16
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:08,240
I’m not working on that right now.

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,870
Now, to make questions, move the verb 'be'
before the subject.

18
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,280
Is he doing anything?

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,510
Are you talking to me?

20
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:27,740
The same rule works if you ask a question
with a question word like 'what', 'why', or

21
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,540
'how'.

22
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,360
Move the verb 'be' before the subject.

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,500
What are you watching?

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,530
Where are they going?

25
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:46,480
Now, you can see that to make questions in
the present continuous, you don’t add anything.

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,790
So don’t add words like 'do' or 'did'.

27
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,840
Just change the order of the words!

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,050
So now you know how to form sentences and
questions with the present continuous.

29
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,410
But how do you use it?

30
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,570
One use is for something happening right now.

31
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,550
This is the most basic use of the present
continuous.

32
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,230
He’s washing his car.

33
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:20,950
They’re watching a film.

34
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:27,260
These sentences are talking about something
which is happening at this moment.

35
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:35,329
Now, we can also use the present continuous
to talk about something which has started

36
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,930
but not finished.

37
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,580
This sounds similar to the last point.

38
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,580
If we say:

39
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,800
He’s washing his car.

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,780
This means he’s started washing his car,
but he hasn’t finished yet.

41
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,830
So what’s the difference?

42
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,269
Why is this separate to the last point?

43
00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:01,760
It’s different because we can also use the
present continuous in this way to talk about

44
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,889
things which are not happening right now.

45
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:06,889
For example:

46
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:10,340
I’m reading a good book at the moment.

47
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:16,159
She’s looking for a new apartment.

48
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,730
If I say, "I’m reading a good book at the
moment," I don’t mean that I’m reading

49
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,319
right now, at this minute.

50
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:28,700
I mean that I’ve started a book and I haven’t
finished it yet.

51
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,070
In the same way, "She’s looking for a new
apartment" doesn’t mean that she’s out

52
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,260
looking for an apartment this minute.

53
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:43,049
It means she’s started looking for an apartment,
but she hasn’t found one yet.

54
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:49,400
In these examples, we use the present continuous
to talk about things happening around this

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,409
moment, not necessarily at this specific moment.

56
00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:00,659
Next, describing a picture.

57
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:06,169
If you have a picture or a photo, and you
want to describe it to someone, you use the

58
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:07,799
present continuous.

59
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,639
A picture or a photo is like a moment in time.

60
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,450
That’s why we use the continuous form to
talk about it.

61
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:23,490
For example, here, we can use the present
continuous to talk about what we see:

62
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,460
They are sitting on a beam, high above the
city.

63
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,630
The two men on the left are smoking.

64
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,930
Some of them are eating sandwiches.

65
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,400
It doesn't matter that the picture was taken
a long time ago.

66
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,840
We can still use the present continuous to
describe it.

67
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,889
Next, talking about something temporary or
different from usual.

68
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:57,710
So, another use of the present continuous
is to show that something is temporary.

69
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,500
Look at these two sentences:

70
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,720
He lives with his parents.

71
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,360
He’s living with his parents.

72
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,229
What’s the difference?

73
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:14,139
Why would you use the present continuous here?

74
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:21,310
In these sentences, the present continuous
shows that the situation is temporary.

75
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:27,430
If you say "He lives with his parents," you
mean that this is permanent.

76
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:34,830
If you say, "He’s living with his parents,"
you mean that this is a temporary situation.

77
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,199
Maybe he’s living with his parents while
he saves enough money to get his own place.

78
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,729
Let’s look at one more example here:

79
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,490
She works in the marketing department.

80
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,470
She’s working in the marketing department.

81
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,800
Is the difference clear now?

82
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:04,670
If you say, "She works in the marketing department,"
you mean that this is her permanent job.

83
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:10,960
If you say, "She’s working in the marketing
department," you mean that she normally works

84
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,280
somewhere else.

85
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,789
She’s just working in the marketing department
temporarily.

86
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:23,120
Next, talking about a changing situation.

87
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,289
I understand there are a lot of ways to use
the present continuous!

88
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:31,830
Remember that you don’t have to learn all
of this at once.

89
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,759
This video will still be here; take a break
and review what we’ve done so far if you

90
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,050
need to.

91
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:44,180
Now, you can also use the present continuous
to talk about a situation which is changing

92
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,289
over time.

93
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:48,230
For example:

94
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:54,599
The population of our city is growing by around
5% a year.

95
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,750
My English is slowly getting better.

96
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:04,360
The river used to be really polluted, but
it’s getting cleaner.

97
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,229
In all of these examples, we’re talking
about a change which is happening over time,

98
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:14,300
and which will probably continue into the
future.

99
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,650
If I say:

100
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,610
The population of our city is growing by around
5% a year.

101
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,650
This means that I expect the population to
continue growing, at least for the next few

102
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,690
years.

103
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:35,400
OK, so you’ve seen how the present continuous
can be used to talk about: things happening

104
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:45,659
now; things which have started but not finished;
describing pictures; talking about temporary

105
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:52,210
situations; talking about changing situations.

106
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,539
All of the meanings we’ve seen so far are
similar.

107
00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:00,630
They are all about something happening around
a moment in time.

108
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:06,330
However, there are also some other ways to
use the present continuous which are completely

109
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,330
different.

110
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,560
Let’s look at a very important one:

111
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,370
Talking about arrangements in the future.

112
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:23,080
Many English learners use 'will' to talk about
the future, but 'will' can’t be used for

113
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,199
everything.

114
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,740
Actually, the present continuous is one of
the most common ways to talk about the future

115
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,159
in English.

116
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:39,260
If you have a solid plan or arrangement, meaning
you know where and/or when something will

117
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,430
happen, you can use the present continuous
to talk about it.

118
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,350
Here are some examples:

119
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,610
We’re meeting outside the cinema at 8.00.

120
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:55,279
They’re coming to ours for dinner on Saturday.

121
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,320
What are you doing next weekend?

122
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:06,640
It’s very common to use the present continuous
when you talk about plans for the near future,

123
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,360
social plans, and so on.

124
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,770
Talking about something strange or annoying.

125
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:23,090
Now we’re getting to more specialised, less
common uses of the present continuous.

126
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:30,089
Using the present continuous together with
adverbs like 'always', 'constantly' or 'continually'

127
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:34,750
can show that you find a repeated action annoying
or strange.

128
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,130
For example:

129
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,480
He’s always forgetting to bring the things
he needs.

130
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,160
They’re constantly gossiping about me behind
my back.

131
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,290
My boss is continually interrupting me while
I’m trying to work.

132
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,540
So, if you say:

133
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,480
He’s always forgetting to bring the things
he needs.

134
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:05,779
You means that he often forgets to bring things,
and you find this strange or annoying.

135
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:11,800
This use of the present continuous is unusual,
because we’re using the present continuous

136
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,860
to talk about a repeated action or a habit,
and we don’t normally do that.

137
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,050
So you must use an adverb in these sentences.

138
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,070
You can’t say:

139
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,420
He’s forgetting to bring the things he needs.

140
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,930
To give it the meaning of something which
you find strange/annoying, you need an adverb.

141
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:38,680
So, 'always' is the most common adverb to
use in these sentences.

142
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,699
OK, we’re nearly there!

143
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:43,430
One more to go:

144
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:50,110
The last use is talking about feelings which
you are starting to be aware of.

145
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,250
Now again, this is a very specialised, less
common way to use the present continuous.

146
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,010
What does it mean?

147
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,730
Think about these two sentences:

148
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,820
I realise I made the wrong decision.

149
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,079
I’m realising I made the wrong decision.

150
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:15,750
Now, they’re both possible, but what’s
the difference?

151
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,149
In the first sentence:

152
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:20,199
I realise I made the wrong decision.

153
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:24,339
Your realisation is not a new feeling.

154
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:26,040
However, when you say:

155
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,690
I’m realising I made the wrong decision.

156
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,290
You mean that you are just starting to think
about this.

157
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,600
The feeling -- that you made the wrong decision
-- is still growing on you.

158
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,690
Let’s do one more example:

159
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,339
I find it difficult to work with him.

160
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,730
I’m finding it difficult to work with him.

161
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,570
Can you see the difference?

162
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,120
Again, if you say:

163
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,470
I find it difficult to work with him.

164
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,490
This isn't something new for you.

165
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,490
You generally find him difficult, and you
dislike working with him.

166
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,490
If you say:

167
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,850
I’m finding it difficult to work with him.

168
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:17,640
This means that you are just starting to realise
how difficult he is, and how you dislike working
