1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,180
Hi!

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,180
I’m Martin.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,700
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,570
Are you taking the IELTS examination?

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,730
What do you know about the reading paper?

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,710
Are you having problems with any of the question
types?

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:26,750
In this lesson, you're going to learn how
to complete matching headings questions in

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,500
the IELTS reading exam.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,619
Part 1: basic tips for the matching headings
section.

10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:41,470
Matching headings is often one of the most
difficult question types for students.

11
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,470
Why?

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:51,020
The main reason is that the headings are usually
very similar to each other.

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:57,350
Also, you have more headings than you need
for the question.

14
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,750
So, how can we make this a little easier?

15
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:10,070
Firstly, if there’s an example - and there
usually is - cross out that answer.

16
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,810
You don’t need it; don’t let it confuse
you.

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:21,950
Also, the example isn’t always the first
paragraph, so make sure you check carefully.

18
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,170
Secondly, check how many questions you need
to answer.

19
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,470
How many extra answers are there?

20
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:37,080
If you are matching headings, do not use any
answer more than once.

21
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:43,210
Finally, and most importantly, you do not
need to read the whole text!

22
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,010
You don’t have time.

23
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:51,210
You get marks for answering the questions,
not understanding the whole text.

24
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,770
Your only job is to choose the correct answers.

25
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,860
So, how can we find them?

26
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:07,170
Part 2: how to answer a matching headings
question.

27
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,660
Take a look at these headings:

28
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,859
1.

29
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:16,200
How wildlife benefits from big trees
2.

30
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,249
How large trees are being destroyed
3.

31
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:22,609
How to support a functioning ecosystem

32
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:30,819
Before you read any of the text, one technique
is to read the headings first.

33
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:36,969
Read the headings and think about the topic
of the text.

34
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:41,840
So, what were your ideas?

35
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,680
Something about trees?

36
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,719
The environment?

37
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:51,949
Now, let’s take a look at the first paragraph.

38
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:55,849
That is a lot of text.

39
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:58,049
We could read it all, but why would we?

40
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:04,489
We don’t need the details, we just need
to work out what the main idea of the paragraph

41
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:05,489
is.

42
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:15,499
And, to do that, we only need the first, second
and last sentences.

43
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:18,439
Much better.

44
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,480
Read the first sentence.

45
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,809
Most paragraphs will start with a mini-introduction
that will often tell you what the paragraph

46
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:29,870
is about.

47
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:35,980
Large trees are an essential part of any successfully
functioning ecosystem.

48
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:42,279
OK, so from our three headings, which one
could it be?

49
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:48,799
Try looking for synonyms and phrases that
have a similar meaning to the first sentence.

50
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,959
Can we rule out any answers yet?

51
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,790
Well, it could be number one.

52
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:02,219
We have a mention of trees, and the words
‘essential part’ and ‘successfully’

53
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:08,040
could connect to the idea of ‘benefits’
in heading number one.

54
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,299
What about number two?

55
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:11,799
We have ‘trees’ again.

56
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:18,959
However, number two contains the word ‘destroyed’,
and there is nothing which connects to this

57
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,690
in the first sentence.

58
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:28,199
In number three, we have the phrase ‘functioning
ecosystem’, which appears in the first sentence.

59
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,330
So, three is another possibility.

60
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:39,740
Even if you think you know, make sure you
read the last sentence of the paragraph to

61
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,720
check your ideas.

62
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,180
Most paragraphs will end with a mini-conclusion.

63
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,729
If this mini-conclusion is on the same topic
as the first sentence, that is often enough

64
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:52,490
to give you the answer.

65
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,180
Let’s look at the last sentence:

66
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:06,930
This allows the trees to support a substantial
proportion of the life in the forest.

67
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,949
What is the meaning of the sentence?

68
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:16,009
Can you see any synonyms or other words which
we can connect to words or phrases in the

69
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:19,000
headings?

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,550
At this point, we can say that it can’t
be heading number two.

71
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,850
In both sentences we have nothing about the
destruction of trees.

72
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,870
Number one is looking very likely.

73
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,909
We have ‘support’ - a similar idea to
‘benefits’ - and ‘life’ - similar

74
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:40,360
to ‘wildlife’.

75
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Number 3?

76
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,129
‘How to support a functioning ecosystem’
suggests that the text should give people

77
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:49,129
advice.

78
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,910
Are these sentences giving us advice or not?

79
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,969
They aren’t, and so we can rule out heading
number three.

80
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:05,720
So you could now choose heading number one
and move onto the next question.

81
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,259
However, if you aren’t sure, don’t worry.

82
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,629
Read the second sentence in the paragraph.

83
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:18,970
This should help you to find the right answer
with more certainty.

84
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:25,499
Without the trees, innumerable species would
be left without habitats and would cease to

85
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:26,650
exist.

86
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:33,780
OK, even if you weren’t sure before, you
can see that this is about trees and how they

87
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,780
help wildlife.

88
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:42,139
The answer must be heading number one: How
wildlife benefits from large trees.

89
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:46,050
Let’s do one more example.

90
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,979
We’ll use the same technique.

91
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,020
Look at these headings:

92
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,900
1.

93
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,650
Working conditions in the UK
2.

94
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,229
The benefits of being a member of a trade
union

95
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:03,099
3.

96
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:07,850
Declining membership of trade unions in the
UK

97
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:15,129
Again, read the headings and think about the
topic of the text.

98
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:19,669
So, what were your ideas?

99
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:21,650
Something about work in the UK?

100
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,780
Membership of trade unions?

101
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:33,150
Now, let’s take a look at our paragraph:

102
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:42,409
Remember, we don’t need the details yet,
we just need the main idea of the paragraph.

103
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:49,469
Again, you just need the first, second and
last sentences.

104
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:55,599
Let’s have a look at the first sentence.

105
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,550
How does that help us?

106
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:05,669
Trade unions provide an essential defence
against exploitative working practices.

107
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:12,909
Okay, exactly the same as before: try looking
for synonyms and phrases that have a similar

108
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,509
meaning to the rest of the sentence.

109
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:19,569
Can we rule any answers out yet?

110
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:22,550
It could be heading number one.

111
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,419
We have the word ‘working’ in both.

112
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:28,629
The sentence also says ‘exploitative’.

113
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:35,599
‘Exploitative’ describes a relationship
where one side is more powerful, and uses

114
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,709
that power to treat the other side unfairly.

115
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:43,599
This could link to ‘working conditions’.

116
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,040
What about heading number two?

117
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,650
The phrase ‘trade union’ is in both.

118
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,260
Also, we have the word ‘defence’.

119
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:58,399
‘Defence’ here connects to the idea of
helping people by protecting their rights.

120
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:05,000
Heading number two talks about ‘benefits’,
so it could still be number two.

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,440
What about the third heading?

122
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,870
‘Trade union’ is in both, but there’s
nothing else to connect the heading to the

123
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,000
first sentence.

124
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,660
So, it looks less likely, but we don’t have
enough information to rule any headings out

125
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,190
yet.

126
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,970
You can see that this example is a little
more difficult.

127
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:33,100
With our first example, we had a good idea
of which heading was right after reading one

128
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,100
sentence.

129
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:41,079
Here, the first sentence of the paragraph
hasn’t helped us much yet.

130
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:42,180
What do you do?

131
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,960
No problem!

132
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,410
Remember: the next step is to look at the
final sentence of the paragraph:

133
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:56,380
A large decrease in the number of members
means that trade unions currently have far

134
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:04,570
less influence compared to the height of their
power in the 1980s.

135
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,560
Does this make things any clearer?

136
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,300
The sentence says the number of members has
decreased.

137
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:19,779
So, heading number three is looking more probable,
because it talks about ‘declining membership

138
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:22,180
of trade unions’.

139
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,829
But, what about headings one and two?

140
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:33,139
There’s nothing obvious in the last sentence
which connects to one or two.

141
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:37,970
However, there’s also nothing which lets
us rule them out.

142
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,750
So, I think we need to do some more work.

143
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,029
What should you do?

144
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:49,130
Read the second sentence.

145
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:57,089
Yet, due to a lack of awareness surrounding
the benefits of joining a union and an increase

146
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:05,550
in temporary work, union membership in the
UK continues to fall year-on-year.

147
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,720
Can we make a final decision now?

148
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:14,600
The second sentence mentions ‘benefits’,
which appears in heading number two, but this

149
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,540
sentence says that people don’t know the
benefits of joining a trade union, which is

150
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,800
a different context from heading number two.

151
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:31,180
So, there’s nothing to connect this sentence
to headings one or two.

152
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,370
What about heading number three?

153
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:40,190
The sentence tells us that trade union membership
continues to fall.

154
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,620
‘Fall’ is a synonym for ‘decline’.

155
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,639
Therefore, we can match heading number three
to this paragraph.

156
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,620
Is that any clearer?

157
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,060
If you aren’t sure why number three is the
answer, remember that you can review this

158
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,790
section as many times as you need.

159
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:06,660
Follow each step and think about the logic
you need to use to reach the right answer.

160
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:13,660
These questions can be challenging, but by
practising the technique, you will feel more

161
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,720
confident when matching headings in your IELTS
reading exam.

162
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:27,890
So, that is how you answer matching headings
questions in the IELTS reading exam.

163
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:33,160
Make sure you practise this technique to improve
your speed.

164
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,050
Some key points to remember for your IELTS
reading exam:

165
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,420
1.

166
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,110
Do not read the whole text.

167
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:48,370
You only need to read the first, last and
maybe the second sentences.

168
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,300
2.

169
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:56,110
Look for synonyms and similar ideas between
the headings and sentences.

170
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:01,690
Is the paragraph saying the same thing, but
in a different way?

171
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,510
3.

172
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:10,769
Remember that seeing synonyms or even the
same words in the paragraph and the heading

173
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:15,730
DOES NOT mean that this heading is the right
one.

174
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,759
Always check that the meaning fits.

175
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,519
4.

176
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,720
If you’ve used the technique and still aren’t
sure of an answer, move on to the next question.

177
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,300
When you’ve answered a few more questions
and used more of the headings, you can come

178
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,800
back to questions you haven’t answered.

179
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,310
5.

180
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,899
Answer all the questions.

181
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:45,790
Even if nothing works, make sure you write
an answer, even if you have to guess between

182
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,260
2 or 3 options.

183
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,860
Well, that’s the end of the lesson.

184
00:13:52,860 --> 00:14:00,230
I hope this helps you answer matching headings
questions in the IELTS reading exam.

185
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:06,410
Good luck if you have an IELTS exam coming
up soon!
