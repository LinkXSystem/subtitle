00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,880
Hi, I’m Martin.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,870
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,800
In this lesson, you can learn to write a CV
or resume in English.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,240
If you’re wondering, ‘CV’ and ‘resume’
have the same meaning.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:26,340
The word ‘CV’ is more common in the UK,
while ‘resume’ is more common in the USA.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,599
Although some people say that there’s a
difference, in everyday speech, a CV and a

7
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:39,680
resume are the same thing: you write a summary
of your employment history, your education

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,750
and your skills in order to apply for a job.

9
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:50,550
In this video lesson, you’ll see how to
write an effective CV in English.

10
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,560
We’ll share some useful language tips to
make your CV clearer.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:06,780
Before we start, we highly recommend you visit
our website: Oxford Online English dot com.

further.

15
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,070
But now, let’s look at how to write your
CV in English.

16
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:33,130
We’re going to divide your CV into four
sections.

17
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:41,180
Your personal profile is a short introduction
to you, your key skills and your career goals.

18
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,830
It generally goes at the top of your CV, under
your contact information.

19
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:53,420
Not all CVs include a personal profile, but
many do.

20
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,310
Many people we’ve spoken to find it the
most difficult part to write.

21
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:05,140
So, if you need a personal profile, what should
you include?

22
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,599
Aim to write four to five sentences.

23
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,439
In the first sentence, introduce yourself.

24
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:19,420
For example: ‘I recently graduated from
the University of Toronto in International

25
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:28,780
Affairs with a 3.8 GPA, and I am seeking employment
in the NGO sector.’

26
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:36,069
‘I am a web development professional looking
to move into a senior role in an established

27
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:39,680
company.’

28
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:47,120
‘I am a cardiology nurse with over ten years’
experience in Spain; I am now looking for

29
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,080
a position in the UK.’

30
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,900
Here, you can see language which you could
adapt to your situation.

31
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:05,510
Take a few seconds: how could you use these
sentences to talk about yourself?

32
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:12,400
Pause the video if you want more time to think
about it!

33
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:20,430
Generally, you should write your personal
profile in full sentences in the first person.

34
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:27,059
You can write in the third person, but this
can sound impersonal; it’s simpler to write

35
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:31,859
in the first person, using ‘I’.

36
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:38,909
After your introduction, write one to three
sentences about the skills you will bring

37
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:42,239
to the job you’re applying for.

38
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,919
Be specific and focus on the facts.

39
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:54,449
Avoid using clichés like ‘team player’,
‘good communicator’ or ‘passionate’.

40
00:03:54,449 --> 00:04:02,420
These are overused in job applications; try
to *show* your good qualities by giving specific

41
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,689
examples instead.

42
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:13,420
Let’s look at some examples here: ‘During
my degree, I did a six-month internship at

43
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:21,460
a Toronto-based charity, and also volunteered
for two local charitable organisations.

44
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:28,780
This has given me an understanding of NGO
work in both smaller and larger organisations,

45
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:34,820
as well as the desire to learn more about
the field.’

46
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:42,930
‘Over the last fifteen years, I have honed
my technical skills by working on a wide range

47
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,349
of projects, both working individually and
in large teams.

48
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:55,680
Recently, I have developed my managerial abilities
by working as a team leader for my current

49
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,740
employer.’

50
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:05,800
‘Since I started working as a ward nurse,
I have pursued every opportunity to learn

51
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:13,819
and develop my skills; consequently, I have
been working as a specialised cardiology nurse

52
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,040
for the past five years.’

53
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:25,620
Because your personal profile should be short,
it’s useful to organise your ideas using

54
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:35,000
time references, like ‘during’, ‘over
the last … years’, ‘recently’, or

55
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,320
‘since…’

56
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:44,210
If you’re writing in the first person, this
also helps you to avoid repetitive sentence

57
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,210
structures.

58
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,400
It doesn’t sound good if every sentence
you write starts with ‘I’.

59
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,660
End your personal profile with a sentence
summarising your career goals.

60
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:05,120
For example: ‘I hope to build on my prior
experience and make a meaningful contribution

61
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,640
by working in an international NGO.’

62
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,159
‘Having worked mostly for start-ups and
smaller firms, I would now like to challenge

63
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,640
myself by managing projects and teams in a
larger company.’

64
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:31,280
‘My short-term goal is to work in an English-speaking
environment, with a view to moving into a

65
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,520
training/teaching role in the medium term.’

66
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,780
And you’ve finished!

67
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:45,180
If you want to read the three full profiles,
go to the full version of this lesson on our

68
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,640
website.

69
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,620
There’s a link in the video description.

70
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:55,090
The exact order of sections on a CV can vary.

71
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:01,349
However, in many cases, you’ll put your
work history at the top, after your personal

72
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:02,419
profile.

73
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:12,069
Let’s see how you can write about your employment
history on your CV.

74
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:18,509
In this section of your CV, you should list
the companies you’ve worked for, the dates

75
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:25,939
you worked there, your responsibilities and
any significant achievements.

76
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:35,229
For example, you might write: ‘Customer
service supervisor, Juice-It, September 2016

77
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:38,840
to January 2019’.

78
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:46,310
‘Main responsibilities: responding to customer
queries and complaints, creating and implementing

79
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:55,469
surveys to gather customer feedback, organising
training sessions for other staff members.’

80
00:07:55,469 --> 00:08:03,060
Often, you won’t write in full sentences
to talk about your responsibilities and achievements.

81
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,999
Instead, you’ll write bulleted lists.

82
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:14,069
There are two possible styles you can use,
and you should choose one.

83
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:19,400
One way is to write sentence fragments starting
with an -ing verb.

84
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,560
You saw this in the example just now.

85
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:32,690
The other common possibility is to write sentence
fragments starting with a past simple verb.

86
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:41,710
So, for example, a full sentence about your
work experience might be: ‘I designed training

87
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:46,040
programs for other staff members.'

88
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:53,070
You could make this a fragment with an -ing
verb, as in ‘Designing training programs

89
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,770
for other staff members.'

90
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:04,640
Or, you could make a fragment with a past
simple verb, as in ‘Designed training programs

91
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,350
for other staff members.’

92
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:12,580
Of course, you can write in full sentences
if you want!

93
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:19,910
However, it’s more common to use one of
these two styles on a CV.

94
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,250
Just remember: don’t mix styles.

95
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:29,990
If you’re writing in fragments starting
with an -ing verb, then all of your bullet

96
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,890
points should be in the same style.

97
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:42,760
Also, when describing your responsibilities
in a role, try to use active, specific vocabulary.

98
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:49,000
For example, instead of ‘Making promotional
materials in print and digital formats’,

99
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:58,080
say ‘Creating promotional materials’ or
‘Designing promotional materials’.

100
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:05,890
Using a more specific verb is better where
possible, so it’s better to use ‘create’

101
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:11,120
than a more general verb like ‘make’.

102
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:18,570
Instead of ‘Worked with customer data to
suggest alternative strategies for sales team

103
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:25,960
members,’ say ‘Analysed customer data
in order to devise more effective strategies

104
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,380
for sales team members’.

105
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:38,500
Next, let’s add one more vital section to
your CV.

106
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:46,301
On most CVs, education either goes at the
top, after the personal profile, or after

107
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:48,900
the work experience section.

108
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:55,100
Here, you list the institution, qualification,
grades and dates.

109
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:02,560
For example: ‘University of Warwick, 2015
to 2018, BSc in chemical engineering, two

110
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,920
one.’

111
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,100
Do you know what ‘two-one’ means?

112
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:15,880
University grades for UK degrees are given
in classes: first class, upper second class,

113
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,800
second class, and so on.

114
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:26,710
‘Two one’ means an upper second class
degree, which is the second highest grade.

115
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:37,740
On a CV, you can write BSc *in* chemical engineering,
or you might write it without the preposition.

116
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,550
This might be all you need, but you might
also add modules you studied, projects you

117
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,390
worked on, or the title of your thesis or
dissertation.

118
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:55,890
Here, the simplest way to add this information
is to use a colon to introduce a list, like

119
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:05,400
this: ‘Modules studied: chemical reactor
design, distillation and absorption, process

120
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,220
synthesis, …’

121
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:15,320
You could also use this to list exams you
took at school; for example: ‘A-Levels:

122
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:23,540
geography, English
literature, politics, economics.

123
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,940
Do you know what A-levels are?

124
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,410
They’re the exams you take at the end of
secondary school in the

125
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,680
UK.

126
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,820
Usually, people take three or four subjects.

127
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:42,020
Depending on where you are in your career,
you might not need a lot of details about

128
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,830
your education.

129
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:50,440
If you’ve been working in your field for
many years and have lots of relevant achievements,

130
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:58,430
then you probably don’t need to go into
details about your high school exam results.

131
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,140
At this point, you have the most important
parts of your CV.

132
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:08,700
There’s one more section you might add.

133
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:15,580
At the end of your CV, you might list relevant
skills, such as other languages which you

134
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:21,200
speak, certificates, or software you can use.

135
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,810
You might also list your hobbies and interests.

136
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,800
Should you add your hobbies and interests
to your CV?

137
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,850
Some people say yes, others say no.

138
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:39,110
We don’t know—this lesson is about how
to write a CV in English.

139
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:46,650
Here, you can keep this simple; introduce
a list using a colon, like this: ‘Proficient

140
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:55,670
with: Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign,
MS Office, QuickBooks.’

141
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:02,350
You can show different levels of skill by
using different adjectives like ‘proficient’,

142
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:07,690
‘familiar’, or ‘competent’.

143
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:17,350
‘Proficient’ suggests a higher level of
skill; ‘competent’ suggests a medium degree,

144
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:22,630
while ‘familiar’ suggests a more basic
level of skill.

145
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:31,040
You can use these adjectives with the preposition
‘with’ plus a noun; for example: ‘proficient

146
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:40,240
with AutoCAD’, ‘competent with WordPress’,
or ‘familiar with a range of common double-entry

147
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,560
bookkeeping applications.’

148
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,560
You can also use some adjectives like this
plus ‘at’ plus an -ing verb.

149
00:14:51,560 --> 00:15:01,400
For example: ‘competent at building and
styling web pages using HTML and CSS.’

150
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:10,680
‘Skilled at using a range of Abode Creative
Suite applications for graphic or print design.’

151
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:19,050
With languages, you can use a similar format;
introduce a list using a colon, like this:

152
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:26,850
‘Languages spoken: Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese.’

153
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:32,230
If you want to add additional information
to something, add it in parentheses, like

154
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,180
this.

155
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,920
As before, you’re not writing in full sentences
here.

156
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:48,260
That means you can be flexible with the structure;
for example, you don’t need to add ‘and’

157
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,150
between the last two items on your list.

158
00:15:52,150 --> 00:16:01,130
However, you *should* still pay attention
to grammar and structure, because it’s important

159
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,500
to be consistent.

160
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:09,220
Finally, you can add your hobbies and interests
if you want.

161
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:18,290
For example: ‘Hobbies and interests: surfing,
DIY, arts and crafts.’

162
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,200
At this point, your CV should be close to
complete.

163
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Don’t forget to proof read carefully before
you send it in!

164
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,650
In most situations, recruiters won’t spend
long the first time they look at your CV.

165
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:39,900
Even small things, like spelling mistakes,
can mean your CV gets thrown out.

166
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,560
So, take the time to check everything.

167
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,050
Do you have any other tips for writing a good
CV?
