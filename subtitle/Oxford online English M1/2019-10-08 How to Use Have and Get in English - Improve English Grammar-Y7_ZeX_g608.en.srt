00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:07,370
Hi, I’m Kasia. Welcome to Oxford Online
English! In this lesson, you can learn about

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,910
the verbs ‘have’ and ‘get’.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:15,570
You’ll see ten different meanings of ‘have’,
and ten different meanings of ‘get’. You’ll

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,030
also see examples, so you can learn to use
the verbs ‘have’ and ‘get’ in different

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,759
ways.

6
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:28,619
This lesson has five parts. Each part starts
with a short dialogue.

7
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,330
In each dialogue, there are two different
ways to use ‘have’, and two different

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,570
ways to use ‘get’.

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:42,360
We suggest that you watch each dialogue two
or three times. Before you continue, try to

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,170
hear the different sentences with ‘have’
and ‘get’. Think about what they mean.

11
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:54,870
Then, watch the explainer section after the
dialogue. You can check if you were right!

12
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,180
Before we start, we really think you should
check out our website: Oxford Online English

15
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,740
Now, let’s see our first dialogue.
Are you going out?

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,140
I have judo class. It’s the first one after
the holidays.

17
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,659
Ah, yeah, I remember. Are you walking?

18
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:25,409
I need to get there before seven, so I think
I’ll get a taxi. I’ll be late otherwise.

19
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,569
OK, well, have a good time!
Did you hear the four phrases with ‘have’

20
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:37,109
and ‘get’?
Let’s see them.

21
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:42,960
Can you explain the meaning of ‘have’
and ‘get’ here?

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,789
‘Have’ can mean ‘take part in an event’,
as in, ‘I have judo class.’

23
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:54,480
You could also say, ‘I have a meeting tomorrow
morning.’

24
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:04,450
‘She has a tennis tournament on Saturday.’
‘What time do you have your Spanish lesson?’

25
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:11,660
You can use this with meetings, classes, social
events, and more.

26
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:17,099
In ‘have a good time’, what do you think
‘have’ means?

27
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:23,720
‘Have’ can also mean ‘experience.’
For example: ‘We had a lot of fun at their

28
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,180
wedding.’
‘He’s having a lot of problems at school

29
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,230
at the moment.’
‘I’ve been having a stressful time at

30
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,260
work recently.’

31
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:43,950
With this meaning of ‘have’, the phrase
‘have a … time’ is useful. Put an adjective

32
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:52,390
in the space: have a *good* time, have a *bad*
time, have a *difficult* time, and so on.

33
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,689
What about the phrases with ‘get’?

34
00:02:54,689 --> 00:03:00,930
‘Get’ can mean ‘arrive’ or ‘reach’.
You can say things like: ‘What time do you

35
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:08,930
think you’ll get here?’
‘The train gets to Berlin at four o’clock.’

36
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,830
In the dialogue, you also heard, ‘I’ll
get a taxi.’ You can also use ‘get’

37
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:20,780
like ‘catch’ or ‘take’, meaning to
use a form of transport. So, you can *get*

38
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:26,780
the metro, *get* a bus, *get* a taxi, and
so on.

39
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,780
For example: ‘If we get the subway, will
we be on time?’

40
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:39,760
‘It’s not worth spending so much for such
a short flight. Let’s get the boat.’

41
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,730
Have you seen the email I sent you?

42
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,879
No. My PC’s got some kind of problem. I
can’t connect to the Internet.

43
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,920
Can’t you look on your phone?

44
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:57,740
Yes, I suppose I can… . Yup, got it. I’ll
look at it right now.

45
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,599
Great. Let me know what you think.

46
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,859
Will do. I need to get someone to fix my computer,
though. I don’t like using my phone for

47
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,049
work stuff.

48
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:12,530
This dialogue was a little different. Can
you see how?

49
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,709
In the dialogue, one of the uses of ‘have’
was as an auxiliary verb: ‘Have you seen

50
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,250
the email I sent?’

51
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:29,750
What was the other usage of ‘have’?
It was: ‘My PC’s got some kind of problem.’

52
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,449
We used ‘have got’ as a form of ‘have’.
We’ll come back to this in a minute.

53
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:43,240
So, ‘have’ can be an auxiliary verb, especially
in perfect tenses. In this case, ‘have’

54
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,920
doesn’t have its own meaning. Instead, it’s
a grammar word; it’s used to make a verb

55
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,240
form.

56
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,319
Look at three examples of this: ‘I haven’t
seen her all day.’

57
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,340
‘We hadn’t realised that we needed to
bring our passports.’

58
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,480
‘She’ll have finished all her exams by
the end of July.’

59
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:15,400
In all three sentences, ‘have’ is not
the main verb. The main verbs are ‘see’,

60
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,520
‘realise’ and ‘finish’.

61
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,889
‘Have’ is used to form the perfect tense.
The sentences are present perfect, past perfect

62
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:28,260
and future perfect, respectively.

63
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:34,410
Again, ‘have’ doesn’t have its own meaning
here. When ‘have’ is an auxiliary verb,

64
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,880
it adds meaning to other words. It doesn’t
mean anything by itself.

65
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:46,210
Actually, ‘have’ is an auxiliary verb
in ‘have got’, too.

66
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:53,300
‘Have got’ is easy; it means the same
as ‘have’ in the most basic sense.

67
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:59,970
You can say ‘I have a new phone’, or ‘I’ve
got a new phone.’

68
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:05,760
You can say ‘They have three children’,
or ‘They’ve got three children.’

69
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,440
There’s no difference in meaning, and it
doesn’t matter which you say.

70
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:19,620
But, be careful! You can’t use ‘have got’
to replace all other meanings of ‘have’.

71
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:26,240
What about ‘get’ in the dialogue? You
heard these phrases.

72
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,289
Any ideas?
‘Got it’ here means ‘I received your

73
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:39,360
email’. ‘Get’ can mean ‘receive’,
so you can get an email, get a text message,

74
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,800
get a present, and so on.

75
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,860
For example: ‘I got a new tablet for my
birthday.’

76
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:53,500
‘Did you get my message?’
In the second phrase, ‘get’ means to ask

77
00:06:53,509 --> 00:07:00,330
someone to do something for you. Generally,
you use the phrase ‘get’, plus a person,

78
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,919
plus ‘to’ plus verb.
You could also say: ‘She’s too old to

79
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,660
look after the garden, so I got someone to
help her once a month.’

80
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:16,980
‘I’m no good at DIY, so I got someone
to paint my living room.’

81
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,860
Did you get everything for tonight?

82
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,500
Let’s see: I got stuff for sandwiches, nachos,
dips, and veggies for dipping. If people are

83
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,970
still hungry later, we can order pizzas. I
guess they can also have the curry I made

84
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,300
last night, if they really want.

85
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,300
What about drinks?

86
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,830
I’m guessing people will bring drinks, but
there’s some wine and a few beers which

87
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,740
people can have. Plus, there’s juice for
everyone who isn’t drinking.

88
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,160
Did you get a birthday card?

89
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,490
Ah, crap! I knew I’d forgotten something.

90
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,460
It’s getting late… Do you think there’s
time to go out and get one now?

91
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,419
Maybe. We’ll have to leave right now.

92
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,039
‘We’? You forgot!

93
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:02,791
OK, OK, I’m going.
This time, let’s start with ‘get’. You

94
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:10,139
heard these phrases.
Actually, you heard one or two more. But,

95
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:16,610
in most of these phrases, ‘get’ has one
meaning. Do you know what?

96
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:23,650
In the first three phrases, ‘get’ means
‘buy’. This is very common.

97
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,199
What about the last phrase: ‘It’s getting
late’?

98
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,351
This is another common use of ‘get’. Here,
‘get’ means ‘become’. Let’s see

99
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,460
some more examples: ‘My water bottle came
open in my bag, so my books got wet.’

100
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,420
‘Can we turn on the heating? It’s getting
really cold in here.’

101
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,900
‘Renting an apartment is getting ridiculously
expensive.’

102
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:57,190
What about ‘have’ in the dialogue?
‘Have’ can mean ‘eat’ or ‘drink’.

103
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:04,269
You can ‘have lunch’, ‘have a snack’,
‘have a cup of coffee’, and so on.

104
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:08,580
You also heard ‘We’ll have to leave right
now.’

105
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,860
‘Have to’ is a kind of modal verb. It
means that something is necessary. The main

106
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:20,030
thing to remember is that ‘have to’ doesn’t
have a connection with ‘have’. They look

107
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:25,220
similar, but they’re completely different
verbs. They don’t have the same meaning,

108
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:31,920
and they don’t follow the same rules.
You look exhausted! Is everything OK?

109
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,600
Ugh… I’m alright, just a bit ill. I got
a cold or a virus of some kind a few days

110
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
ago.

111
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,970
There’s something going around. A lot of
people at my office had something similar

112
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,970
last week.

113
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,750
I think it might be stress-related, too. I’ve
been working a lot, and I’m not getting

114
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,240
enough sleep.

115
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,140
Have you been to the doctor’s?

116
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:58,370
No, I’m just going to stay at home and rest.
It’s a shame; I was planning to visit Sarah

117
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,370
on Saturday.

118
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,700
You’re not going?

119
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,120
I can’t! She’s just had her baby boy.
She got home from the hospital two days ago.

120
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,630
Oh yes, of course.
Both ‘have’ and ‘get’ can be used

121
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:18,980
to talk about illness. In the dialogue, you
heard these: ‘I got a cold or a virus of

122
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:24,000
some kind a few days ago.’
‘A lot of people at my office had something

123
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,940
similar last week.’
What do you think: what’s the difference

124
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,300
between *getting* an illness, and *having*
an illness?

125
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:41,290
‘Get ill’ is similar to ‘catch an illness’.
You use it to talk about the start of an illness.

126
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:48,860
Often, you can use both words. You can say
‘I got a cold’, or ‘I caught a cold’.

127
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,980
There’s no difference.

128
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,610
‘Have an illness’ is similar to ‘be
ill.’ You use it to describe the state of

129
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,790
being ill.

130
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:04,680
In this case, you can also use ‘have got’.
You can say ‘I have a cold’ or ‘I’ve

131
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,910
got a cold.’

132
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,100
You also heard: ‘I’m not getting enough
sleep.’

133
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:18,540
‘She’s just had her baby boy.’
Can you explain these?

134
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:23,040
This might sound confusing, but ‘get’
can mean something similar to ‘have’,

135
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:30,810
especially when you’re talking about lifestyle
habits like sleep, diet, exercise and so on.

136
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:36,760
So, you can say: ‘He doesn’t get enough
fruit and vegetables in his diet.’

137
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,880
‘I definitely don’t get enough exercise.’
‘I get about seven hours of sleep every

138
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,339
night.’
The meaning of ‘get’ here is something

139
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:52,230
between ‘have’ and ‘do’.

140
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,029
What about the second sentence, with ‘have’?

141
00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:01,180
‘Have’ can mean to give birth. If you
say ‘She had a baby last week,’ you mean

142
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,020
that she gave birth.

143
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,480
What did you think?

144
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,500
I didn’t like it. Plus, the rent was way
too high for such a small place.

145
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,940
I don’t get it. Why show people an apartment
in such a bad state?

146
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:21,010
Yeah, I know. I guess it’s a seller’s
market. Did you have a look at the bathroom?

147
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,500
Yes! It was gross.

148
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,800
You’d need to have the whole place redecorated,
and even then it wouldn’t be a good deal.

149
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,190
Do you think they’ll actually get a thousand
a month for it? It seems way too high.

150
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,630
Salaries around here are pretty high. People
get a lot of money, even for basic jobs. I

151
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,560
agree it’s not a good deal, but I imagine
someone will probably take it.

152
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,190
Hmmm… Anyway, how many more places are we
looking at today?

153
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:55,350
Look at four phrases from the dialogue.
Do you know what ‘get’ and ‘have’

154
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:01,260
mean in these sentences?
‘Get’ can mean ‘understand’. ‘I

155
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,130
don’t get it’ means ‘I don’t understand.’

156
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:12,029
You could also say ‘Do you get what I mean?’
which means ‘Do you understand me?’

157
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:18,600
‘Have’ can be used in certain phrases
to mean ‘do an action’. You can have a

158
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:25,010
look, have a shower, have a walk, or have
a nap.

159
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:30,160
For example, you might say ‘We had a short
walk before dinner.’

160
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,360
‘I wish I could have a nap in the afternoon.
I get so sleepy after lunch!’

161
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,130
In the third sentence, ‘have’ is used
in the structure ‘have something done’.

162
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:48,240
This means—usually—that you pay someone
else for a service.

163
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:56,589
For example, you can have your hair cut, have
your house painted, or have your car repaired.

164
00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:04,550
In all of these, the idea is the same: you
pay someone else to do the work for you.

165
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:09,709
You can also use ‘get’ in these phrases,
with the same meaning, although it’s slightly

166
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:15,790
more informal. So, you can say ‘get your
hair cut’, ‘get your house painted’

167
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,940
or ‘get your car repaired.’

168
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:25,060
Finally, ‘get’ can be used to mean ‘earn
money’ or ‘make money’. You can use

169
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:33,030
it to talk about salaries, as in ‘Plumbers
can get over three k a month around here.’

170
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:38,550
You can also use it for other things. For
example: ‘I got fifteen hundred pounds for

171
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:44,320
my old car.’
This means you sold your old car, and you

172
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,220
made one thousand five hundred pounds from
the sale.

173
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:55,149
Of course, there are other ways to use ‘have’
and ‘get’. We couldn’t fit every meaning

174
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:57,700
of these verbs into one lesson.

175
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:04,649
Here’s a question: can you find any other
common meanings of ‘have’ or ‘get’?

176
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:10,080
If you can, post the meaning and an example
in the comments. You can learn more about

177
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:16,420

00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,420
Thanks for watching!

179
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,929
