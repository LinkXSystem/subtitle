00:00:01,329 --> 00:00:02,399
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,660
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,429
Many English learners have similar problems,
and say the same things: “I’ve been studying

4
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:12,730
for years, but I still can’t speak fluently!”

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,080
“How can I remember vocabulary?”

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,580
“How do I stop translating in my head?”

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,189
In this video, we’ll talk about what it
means to learn English, why so many learners

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,970
have these problems, and what you can do to
learn more effectively.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,900
First, have you seen our website?

10

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,720
Also, one more thing.

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,049
Don't forget to turn on the captions if you
need them!

16
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:52,600
All our videos have captions in English, some
have captions in other languages too.

to turn on captions now.

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:04,080
Let’s start with a question: what does it
mean to learn something?

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,230
No, really, think about it.

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:11,440
When you say, “I learned this,” what do
you mean?

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,700
Actually, it can mean different things.

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,800
All learning depends on three things: theory,
memory and practice.

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,290
You need to understand ideas and concepts—theory.

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,220
You need to remember ideas and how to do things—memory.

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,920
And, you need to use things in real life—practice.

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,350
When you learn something, you need a balance
between these three things, and you need the

27
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,560
right balance.

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,410
If you don’t get the balance right, you’ll
find it difficult to learn.

29
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:51,000
You’ll waste time and energy, and you'll probably
get worse results than you could have.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,820
Let’s talk about this balance in more detail.

31
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,460
When you learn different things, you need
different amounts of theory, memorisation,

32
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,400
and practice.

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,950
For example, think about learning to ride
a bike.

34
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,850
Do you need theory, or memorisation?

35
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,860
Not really!

36
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,530
No one learns to ride a bike by reading books.

37
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,470
You get on a bike, and you try.

38
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,110
You fall off; you try again.

39
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,990
It’s almost 100 per cent practice.

40
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,640
Let’s take a very different example: aeronautical
engineering, meaning designing aeroplanes

41
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,300
and rockets.

42
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,310
OK, I’ll be honest: I don’t know, because
I’m not an aeronautical engineer, but I’m

43
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,430
guessing that it’s a lot of theory and memorisation,
and less practice, because when you’re designing

44
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,620
a plane or a rocket, you should get it right
first time.

45
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,750
So, what’s the point?

46
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:49,020
When you learn different things, you need
a different balance of these three areas—theory,

47
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,880
memorisation and practice.

48
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,740
What about learning English?

49
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,300
Here’s my suggestion.

50
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,020
It’s not meant to be something precise.

51
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,400
This isn’t statistics.

52
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,819
What does this mean for you?

53
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:09,370
Many English learners have problems because
they get this balance wrong, and they get

54
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,209
it wrong in similar ways.

55
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:17,420
What are the biggest problems English learners
have here?

56
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,840
One: they focus too much on theory.

57
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,360
Two: they try to use theory and memorisation
to replace practice.

58
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,660
Three: they leave memorisation to luck.

59
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,400
And Four: they don’t practice enough, or effectively.

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,520
These mistakes lead to all the common English-learner
complaints: “I’ve been studying for years

61
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,160
but I can’t speak fluently!”, “I learn
vocabulary, but I can’t remember it!”,

62
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,379
and so on.

63
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:50,530
Let’s see what you can do about these problems,
and how you can make your English learning

64
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,130
more effective.

65
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,640
In this section, we’re going to talk about
the first two problems: focusing too much

66
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,580
on theory, and using theory and memorisation
to replace practice.

67
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,240
Actually, this isn’t English learners’
fault.

68
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,780
Many people learn English—and other languages—in
a theory-heavy way at school or university.

69
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:20,159
Then, they think this is what language learning
means: sitting in a classroom, doing grammar

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,920
exercises, and so on.

71
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,499
Theory is part of English learning.

72
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,639
Going to a language class might be useful.

73
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,600
Doing grammar exercises can be helpful in
the right situation.

74
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,460
But, here’s the key point: practice comes
first.

75
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,580
Practice should come before theory.

76
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,099
Using a language is a practical skill.

77
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:47,949
It’s more like riding a bike than designing an airplane or a rocket.

78
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:51,289
You can’t replace practice by studying theory.

79
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:54,590
You can’t learn to speak by doing exercises
from a book.

80
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,840
You can’t learn to write essays by reading
other people’s essays.

81
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,659
Here’s a question: do you have problems
speaking fluently, because you’re translating

82
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:06,190
whole sentences in your head?

83
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,330
Yes?

84
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,800
If you do, that’s a sign that you’ve studied
English in a way which depends too much on

85
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,110
theory and not enough on practice.

86
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,539
If you do this, you end up trying to ‘calculate’
sentences in your head.

87
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:20,939
That’s really hard!

88
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:23,900
It’s like doing complex maths at high speed.

89
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,779
Of course you can’t speak fluently if you’re
doing this.

90
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:32,809
Again, theory is not useless! Studying theory is not useless.

91
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:35,539
But, you have to put practice first.

92
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,139
If you want to learn to speak, you have to
speak.

93
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:41,189
If you want to learn to write, you have to
write.

94
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:45,020
Theoretical study should support your practice.

95
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,820
What does that mean?

96
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,460
Let’s take something which for many people
is the biggest symbol of boring English lessons—grammar

97
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,960
exercises.

98
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,240
Grammar exercises can be extremely useful!

99
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,589
But, you should only do them only when you
really need them.

100
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:06,060
For example, imagine you’re speaking English
regularly, but you’re not good at using

101
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,569
the present perfect.

102
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:12,879
You know something about it, and you hear
other people use it, and you know that you

103
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,110
can’t use it well when you speak.

104
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,800
That’s the right moment to take your grammar
book and read about the present perfect and

105
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,649
do some exercises.

106
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:28,389
More generally, you should only study theory—like
grammar rules or vocabulary exercises—when

107
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:31,440
you already know what you need.

108
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,040
Don’t take your grammar book, or your vocabulary
book, and start at unit one and say, “I’m

109
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,270
going to study this whole book!”

110
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,619
Have you ever done that?

111
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:41,719
I have.

112
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:42,719
It doesn’t work.

113
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:44,279
You won’t finish the book.

114
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,099
You probably won’t even finish the first
three units.

115
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:49,370
It’s boring and it doesn’t help you.

116
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,629
Get a good grammar book.

117
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:53,610
Get a good vocabulary book.

118
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,689
Get books on writing, or IELTS, or whatever
you need.

119
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:00,389
Then, take what you need when you need it.

120
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:04,259
If you don’t know what something is, then
you don’t need it yet.

121
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:09,310
If you aren’t sure whether you need something
or not, then you don’t need it yet.

122
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,360
By the way, I’m not making this stuff up.

123
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,589
It comes directly from my own language-learning experiences.

124
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:17,779
As you might know, I live in Greece.

125
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,750
My Greek is not that good.

126
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:30,819
[speak some Greek] I haven’t really studied
formally.

127
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,400
At one point, I realised that I didn’t know
how to form the past tense.

128
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,719
I knew *some* past verbs, but I couldn’t
make past forms which I hadn’t seen before.

129
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:43,509
Obviously, using past forms is very helpful.

130
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:48,309
In any conversation, you’ll probably need
a past verb at some point.

131
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:55,380
So, I found some grammar notes, did some exercises,
and I learned how to make past forms.

132
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,720
It wasn’t boring or difficult, because I
felt I needed it.

133
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,539
And, it helped me immediately, so I remembered
most of what I studied.

134
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:08,220
Here’s a summary: put practice first.

135
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:13,419
When you feel you need something theoretical,
like a grammar point or vocabulary on a certain

136
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:15,699
topic, then go and study it.

137
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:19,919
You need to feel that you need it, because
otherwise it probably won’t stay in your

138
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,400
head.

139
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,599
The same is true with memorising things.

140
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,569
There’s no point memorising something unless
you know you need it.

141
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:32,849
Don’t learn a big list of vocabulary which
you’ll probably never use.

142
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,750
Go out and practise, talk to people, write
something, find out what you can’t say and

143
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,360
which ideas you can’t express, and then
learn those words.

144
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,920
Let’s move on and talk more about memorisation.

145
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,820
Remember the problem that we said many English
learners have with memorisation?

146
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,780
Too many English learners leave memorisation
to luck.

147
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,320
Memorisation isn’t enough by itself to learn
a language.

148
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,600
But, it is an important point.

149
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,930
For example, take a topic which many English
learners find difficult: preposition use.

150
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,870
Should I use ‘at’ or ‘on’?

151
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,820
What’s the difference between ‘to’ and
‘for’?

152
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,040
Why do I need to use ‘on’ here?

153
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,290
Often, leaners approach this like other grammar
topics, where you start by learning rules.

154
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,930
But, there aren’t really rules, or at least,
not so many useful ones.

155
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:36,900
Learning to use prepositions is more about
memorising lots and lots and lots of information.

156
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,380
You have to memorise specific word combinations
and phrases.

157
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:47,080
Why do you say ‘it depends on’ and not
‘it depends of’?

158
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,820
There’s no good reason.

159
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,920
You just need to remember: ‘depend’ plus
‘on’.

160
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,800
Many other topics are like this.

161
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,180
They depend more on memory than theory.

162
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,420
If you can’t remember the information, then
you can’t use the language correctly.

163
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,100
At this point, you’ll start thinking in
your language.

164
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,060
Then you’re translating, which means you’re
calculating sentences again, which

165
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,220
doesn’t give you good results.

166
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,040
So, memorisation is necessary.

167
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,320
Here’s another point about memorisation:
it’s measurable.

168
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,560
A question: imagine you try to learn ten new
words.

169
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,000
How many will you remember next week?

170
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,570
How many will you remember next month?

171
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,760
How many will you remember in a year?

172
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,020
What do you think?

173
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,080
Say a number.

174
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:42,200
When I ask most students these questions,
they almost all say that they’ll remember

175
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,990
zero words in a year.

176
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,240
If that’s true for you, then why learn these
new words?

177
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,860
There’s no point learning something if you’re
just going to forget it again.

178
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,740
Also, that’s not really learning!

179
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,980
So, what’s the solution?

180
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,380
The first part you already know: put practice
first.

181
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,640
You won't remember things if you're not using them.

182
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,860
Practice needs to come first.

183
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,280
Don't try to memorise things you don't need.

184
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,580
Just like you shouldn't study theory unless you need it right now.

185
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,580
Secondly: make a system for memorisation.

186
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,930
If you’ve watched our other videos,
you might already know what I’m going to

187
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,930
talk about.

188
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,680
“Is he going to tell us to use Anki again?”

189
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,010
Yes, yes I am.

190
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,270
If you don’t know, Anki is a very powerful
digital flashcard app.

191
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:36,690
It lets you practice with questions and answers
on your laptop or phone or tablet, and it’s

192
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,040
designed to help you memorise large amounts
of information.

193
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,060
I’m not getting paid by Anki or anything
like that.

194
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,060
I’m telling you this because I know it works
from my experience.

195
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,220
I’ll tell you: I lived in China and I studied
Chinese, including writing.

196
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,800
Learning to write in Chinese involves a huge
amount of memorisation.

197
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,530
To write at a basic level, you need to know
around one to two thousand characters.

198
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:08,550
I spent three years in China, and at the end
I took a C1-level exam, which is equivalent

199
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,170
to around band 7 or 7.5 in IELTS.

200
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,190
That meant I had to write essays and other
things in Chinese.

201
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:22,530
So, I went from basically zero to C1 level
in three years, and Anki helped a lot.

202
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,370
You don’t have to use Anki.

203
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,090
There are other flashcard apps.

204
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,240
You don’t have to use a flashcard app.

205
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,070
There are other ways to memorise things.

206
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:36,720
But, you should have a system, and you should
ask yourself how well that system works.

207
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,340
Think about the question you saw before: if
you try to memorise ten things today, how

208
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,840
many will you remember in a year?

209
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,320
It won’t be ten.

210
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Nothing’s perfect!

211
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
And, that’s fine.

212
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,120
But, it shouldn’t be zero either.

213
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,100
Whatever you do to memorise things, it should
work.

214
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,900
The information should stay in your head.

215
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,360
If it doesn’t work, then try something different!

216
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Or, don't do it at all!

217
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,820
There's no point in memorising something if you're going to forget it again.

218
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,960
Spend your time on something better.

219
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,420
Don’t leave memorisation to luck.

220
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,650
You don’t have to!

221
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,710
There are tools you can use.

222
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,480
Also, even if you’re lazy, you should do
this.

223
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,440
In fact, especially if you’re lazy, you
should do this.

224
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Why?

225
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,810
Because being systematic about memorisation
will save you so much time, effort and stress

226
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,910
in the long term.

227
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,400
Many English learners get demotivated because
they go in circles, studying the same things

228
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,850
over and over and over again; learning and
forgetting and learning and forgetting and

229
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,060
learning and forgetting…

230
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,020
Everyone’s motivation is limited.

231
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,240
If this is you, you’ll give up eventually.

232
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,170
You’ll waste a lot of time and money and
energy.

233
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,930
So, be systematic about memorisation.

234
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,100
Measure your results!

235
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,680
Be a scientist.

236
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,140
Save your time, save your money, and save
your energy.

237
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,400
But, remember: memorisation isn’t everything.

238
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,420
The most important thing is practice.

239
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,790
Let’s talk about that!

240
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:20,010
You know this already: practice is the most
important part of learning English.

241
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,870
Here are some questions many English learners
have about practicing:

242
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,960
“How do I find someone to practice with?”

243
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,010
“Can I practice by myself?”

244
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,090
In this section, we’ll talk about effective
practice.

245
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,250
I’ll start by answering these questions.

246
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,500
You might not like my answers!

247
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,900
First: how do you find someone to practice
with?

248
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,070
I don’t know.

249
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,450
You have to solve that problem.

250
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:51,520
You can make friends with English speakers,
do a language exchange, join a conversation

251
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,820
group, pay for a language school, or pay for
a private teacher.

252
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,690
I don’t know what’s possible for you.

253
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,990
You have to find your own solution here.

254
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,320
I’m not trying to be unkind; it’s just
reality.

255
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:10,040
But, I’ll say this: learning to do anything
will cost you time or money or both.

256
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,060
If you have more time than money, then use
your time.

257
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:18,300
Look for English speakers or English-speaking
groups online or near where you live.

258
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,970
Or, start your own!

259
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:26,040
If you have more money than time, then pay
for a teacher or a class.

260
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,620
What about the second question: can you practice
effectively by yourself?

261
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,150
No, not really.

262
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,600
Why not?

263
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,230
Because effective practice needs feedback.

264
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,089
To be clear, practising by yourself can be
useful, but only if you’re also practising

265
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:45,589
with other people and getting feedback regularly.

266
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:49,780
If you’re *only* practising by yourself,
it won’t work.

267
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,620
So, what *should* you do to practice effectively?

268
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,270
One: practice as much as possible.

269
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,680
Two: practise as widely as possible.

270
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,430
Talk to many people, about many different
things.

271
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,360
Write different kinds of texts, on as many
different topics as you can.

272
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,860
Three: make sure you have feedback.

273
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,430
Feedback doesn’t have to be formal.

274
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:18,120
It doesn’t have to come from a teacher,
although sometimes that might be necessary.

275
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,300
Feedback can be simple.

276
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:26,440
For example, if you say something to someone,
and they go like this [confused face], that’s

277
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,450
feedback!

278
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,900
It tells you that what you said wasn’t clear.

279
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,060
Four: practice accurately.

280
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,290
Accept that you will make mistakes, but don’t
be happy about it.

281
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,870
Try to speak and write as accurately as you
can.

282
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,550
Work on your mistakes and your weaknesses
continually.

283
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,680
Five: practice repetitively.

284
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,060
Practice repetitively?

285
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,820
Why?

286
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Repetition is boring.

287
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,060
OK, I know.

288
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,029
But, it’s effective!

289
00:16:56,029 --> 00:17:00,540
Many English learners ask “How can I stop
translating in my head?”

290
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,490
Well, I’ll tell you the answer right now!

291
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,910
It’s not complicated.

292
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,939
When people ask me this question, I ask them
a question back.

293
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:13,220
Actually, I have a simple conversation with
them: “Hello!

294
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,839
How are you?

295
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,060
Where are you from?”

296
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,839
Let’s try it now together: hello!

297
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,779
How are you?

298
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,080
Where are you from?

299
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:33,180
Do you have to translate in your head to answer
those questions?

300
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,540
Most people say that they don’t.

301
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,460
Why not?

302
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,900
It’s because you’ve answered these questions
hundreds of times.

303
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,680
You can answer automatically.

304
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,289
You don’t have to think, and you don’t
have to translate from your language.

305
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:50,059
That’s the solution right there.

306
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,820
If you don’t want to translate in your head,
then you have to respond automatically.

307
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,660
To do that, you have to practice and repeat
the same things many, many times.

308
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:07,190
So, when you practice, don’t talk about
a topic once, talk about it many times.

309
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:13,940
Don’t practice answering a question once;
repeat your answer over and over again.

310
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,040
Don’t write an essay once.

311
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:19,929
Get feedback, and then write an improved version.

312
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:24,800
Build repetition into your practice, and you’ll
get better results.

313
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,200
I hope this lesson was useful for you.

314
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,169
Thanks very much for watching!
