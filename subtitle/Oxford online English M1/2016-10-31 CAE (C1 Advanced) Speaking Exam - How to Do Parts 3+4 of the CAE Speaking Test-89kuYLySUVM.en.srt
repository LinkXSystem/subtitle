00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,230
Hello, I’m Jack, and welcome to Oxford Online
English!

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,950
In this lesson, you can learn how to improve
your score in parts three and four of the

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,500
CAE speaking exam.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,770
Let’s first look at Part 3.

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:24,720
In part three, you’ll discuss a question
based around five or more related points.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,990
Let’s look at a sample question:

7
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,940
"What are the advantages and disadvantages
of these different activities for meeting

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,400
people and getting fit?

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:42,160
You’ll have two minutes to do this, and
you’ll talk to the other candidate or candidates.

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,900
You won’t talk to the examiner during part
three.

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,510
After two minutes, the examiner will ask you
to make a decision with your partner about

12
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,420
the topic you just talked about.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,900
For example, the examiner might ask:

14
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,899
"Which of these activities do you think is
the most beneficial for young people?"

15
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,780
You’ll have a minute to discuss the question.

16
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,140
Towards the end of the minute, you should
try to come to a conclusion together.

17
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,890
If you can’t agree on a decision, then what?

18
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,760
It’s okay – you won’t lose marks!

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,800
Just finish by summarizing your two different
opinions.

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:25,490
Let’s look at some tips you can use in part
three of the CAE speaking test.

21
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:30,010
My first tip is to learn conversation fillers.

22
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,330
What do you do if you don’t know what to
say?

23
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:37,250
It’s always better to say something rather
than nothing, right?

24
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,490
Remember, the examiners can’t mark you if
you’re silent.

25
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,200
That’s why it’s a good idea to use conversation
fillers.

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,420
These are phrases you can use to give yourself
some extra thinking time.

27
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,030
Here are two examples:

28
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,990
"Let me think about that for a moment…"

29
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,710
"That’s an interesting question…"

30
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,299
Let’s do an exercise to practice this.

31
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,420
Here are six phrases.

32
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,710
However, three of them are probably more likely
to be used as fillers.

33
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,729
Can you guess which ones they are?

34
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,560
"Do you know what I mean?"

35
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,569
"I’d never really thought about that, but
I suppose…"

36
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,760
"That’s exactly how I feel."

37
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,959
"Let me consider this for a moment, it’s
quite complicated…"

38
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:24,959
"Fantastic.

39
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,060
Do you mind if I just add something…"

40
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,769
"To be honest that’s not a question I’ve
ever thought about before…"

41
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:35,389
Which ones did you guess?

42
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,469
Did you guess these ones?

43
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:40,659
Now, don’t use these fillers too much.

44
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,090
You’ll waste time and it won’t sound natural.

45
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,629
However, knowing one or two filler phrases
can really help you if you have nothing to

46
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:50,769
say.

47
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:55,079
Tip number two: focus on depth and detail.

48
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:59,919
To score highly, it’s not necessary to talk
about all the points in part three.

49
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,109
It’s better to talk about three or four
points in depth.

50
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:06,559
Let’s look at the sample question again:

51
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:11,769
"What are the advantages and disadvantages
of these different activities for meeting

52
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:13,930
people and getting fit?"

53
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,889
Which activities would you choose to talk
about?

54
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:24,620
I’d probably talk about chess, soccer and
hip-hop dancing, because they seem like very

55
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,379
different activities.

56
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:32,250
The main thing to remember is to avoid rushing
through the points with your partner.

57
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,489
Remember, going into depth will let you demonstrate
more advanced language.

58
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,170
Let’s look at two sample answers:

59
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,959
"eGaming and chess aren’t very good for
getting fit, but they might be good for meeting

60
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,810
people with similar interests.

61
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,629
Sports like swimming or soccer are better
for people who want to get fit."

62
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:58,819
This isn’t bad, but the candidate is trying
to cover too many things too quickly.

63
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:05,299
This means the answer is simple and the candidate
can’t use much advanced or interesting language.

64
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:08,219
Let’s look at a better answer:

65
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:13,920
"Of course chess isn’t a good way to get
fit, because it’s a sedentary activity.

66
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,090
It’s exercise for the mind, not for the
body!

67
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,900
I’m not sure how social chess is but I guess
you could connect with people by talking about

68
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,220
tactics and exchanging tips on how to play."

69
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,260
By focusing on one point—chess—the candidate
can go into more detail and use a wider range

70
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,600
of language.

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,040
Focusing on this will help your score; your
scores depend on the language you use, not

72
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,390
how many points you cover.

73
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,920
Tip number three: use all the time you have.

74
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,440
After two minutes, the examiner will ask you
to reach a decision with your partner.

75
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,870
The question might be something like this:

76
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,340
"Which of these activities would be the most
beneficial for young people?"

77
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,930
When responding to this question, don’t
try to reach a decision too early.

78
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:09,190
Your goal is to discuss the question with
your partner, not answer it.

79
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:15,750
You have one minute to discuss your ideas
with your partner and try to reach a conclusion.

80
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,410
Once you feel that you are near the end of
the minute, use a phrase to show your partner

81
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,330
that you should finish your discussion.

82
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,890
Here are some phrases you could use:

83
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,550
"So, are we in agreement that soccer is the
most beneficial?"

84
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,850
"Alright, it’s safe to say that we agree
that soccer is the most beneficial."

85
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,490
"Are we on the same page?"

86
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,630
But here’s one important point to remember.

87
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,660
In part three, it’s not necessary that you
agree at the end.

88
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,930
In fact, disagreeing can give you the opportunity
to demonstrate some advanced language and

89
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,360
communication skills.

90
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:02,520
So my next tip for part 3 of the CAE speaking
exam is learn ways to agree and disagree.

91
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,970
Firstly, when you state an opinion, what do
you usually say?

92
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,560
Here are some examples:

93
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,770
"I’m of the opinion that…"

94
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,810
"I tend to believe that…"

95
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,180
"I feel as if…"

96
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,110
For example:

97
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,460
"I’m of the opinion that sports like soccer
are really beneficial for young people, because

98
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,750
they teach them to work together as a team."

99
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:33,660
"I tend to believe that physical activities
like swimming or surfing are more beneficial

100
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,560
than things like chess or eGaming."

101
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,420
"I feel as if the best activity depends on
the individual.

102
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,810
They could all be beneficial, but different
people will take different things from each

103
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,110
activity."

104
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:52,060
Now if you agree with the other candidate,
you could say:

105
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,840
I totally agree…"

106
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
"That’s a good point…"

107
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,010
"I tend to agree that…"

108
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:03,880
But you may also disagree, and this really
gives you the chance to show your good manners.

109
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,590
"I see what you’re saying, but I suppose
I would add that…"

110
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,420
"May I also suggest that…"

111
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,120
"I’m with you on that; however…"

112
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,360
And if you can’t come to a conclusion together
at the end of part three, can you think of

113
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,700
what you could say?

114
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:29,170
Imagine that your partner believes that soccer
is the most beneficial, but you believe that

115
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,790
hip-hop dancing is more beneficial.

116
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,080
What would you say?

117
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,660
Here’s one possibility.

118
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:40,780
"So I guess we’re not in agreement as to
which activity is the most beneficial.

119
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:47,669
I’d say that soccer is the most beneficial,
whereas he is leaning towards hip-hop dancing."

120
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:53,110
The examiners really like to see candidates
who interact politely, so practising a few

121
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,270
of these phrases will help you demonstrate
this.

122
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,800
Tip number five: ask for your partner’s
opinion.

123
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,220
As you’ve seen, you need to focus on interacting
with your partner in the CAE speaking exam.

124
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,710
This is especially important in part three,
because you talk only to your partner during

125
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,980
part three.

126
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,320
The examiner doesn’t take part in the discussion.

127
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,990
How can you interact with your partner and
make the conversation feel more natural?

128
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,771
A good way is to ask your partner for his/her
opinion whenever you can.

129
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:29,800
Can you think of some useful phrases to do
this?

130
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,060
Some examples are:

131
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,750
"What do you think?"

132
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,630
"Do you know what I mean?"

133
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,449
"How do you feel about that?"

134
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:40,919
You could also use a more colloquial phrase,
like:

135
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,979
"Do you get what I’m saying?"

136
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:44,749
"What do you reckon?"

137
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:47,420
"Where do you stand on this?"

138
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,330
Just make sure that you also spend time giving
your opinions too!

139
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:57,230
To get the best scores, you and your partner
need to balance your talking time.

140
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,319
Don’t talk for too long—bring your partner
into the conversation often.

141
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:06,579
Next, let’s look at part four of the CAE
speaking test.

142
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:11,610
In part four, the examiner asks candidates
questions about their opinions about topics

143
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,010
related to part three.

144
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:18,660
If you’ve been talking about sports and
activities in part three, part four would

145
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,499
continue on this topic.

146
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:23,730
For example, one question might be:

147
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,730
"Do you think that sport should be compulsory
at school?"

148
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,120
This part lasts for five minutes.

149
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,779
The examiner will ask you several questions.

150
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:40,089
The examiner asks you the questions, but then
you need to interact with your partner.

151
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:44,399
A lot of the advice and language you’ve
seen in this video is also useful for part

152
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,839
four.

153
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,910
Using filler phrases, agreeing and disagreeing
and interacting with your partner are still

154
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:56,410
important in part four, so you can use a lot
of the advice you’ve already seen in this

155
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,410
video.

156
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,449
However, let’s look at some advice that
can help you with part four specifically.

157
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:03,279
First: always develop your ideas.

158
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,630
This is important throughout your CAE speaking
test, but it’s especially important in part

159
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,079
four.

160
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,279
With everything you say, always add reasons,
examples or counterarguments.

161
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,519
Let’s look at a sample question:

162
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,920
"Do you think that sport should be compulsory
at school?"

163
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,410
Here’s a sample answer:

164
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,800
"Yes, I think so.

165
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,220
It’s really important for personal development."

166
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,850
This answer’s okay – the candidate provided
a reason.

167
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,180
That’s a great start.

168
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,470
But can you think of how to improve it?

169
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,410
Let’s develop the answer by adding some
examples.

170
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,500
Can you think of any?

171
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,600
"For instance, playing sport can help a person
to develop leadership skills, as well as self-discipline.

172
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,069
Many sports also involve teamwork, so you
can learn how to get along with others and

173
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,379
make friends."

174
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,750
You can see that adding a detailed example
like this allows the candidate to use more

175
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,670
advanced vocabulary, like 'leadership skills'
or 'self-discipline'.

176
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:08,329
Let’s look at another question and see how
we can improve it.

177
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:13,100
"Do you think that some sports are more suitable
at school than others?"

178
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,889
Here’s a possible answer:

179
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:21,180
"I think that sports that involve a lot of
physical activity are better because they

180
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,660
are good for your health."

181
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:28,629
Again, this answer is not bad, but we can
improve it by adding more details:

182
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:32,950
"Adolescence is a time when the body is changing
rapidly.

183
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,839
By getting exercise when you’re young, you
set yourself up for better health later in

184
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,079
life.

185
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,699
What do you think?"

186
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:47,279
Again, adding details makes the answer more
interesting and also allows you to use a wider

187
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,399
range of language.

188
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:54,850
Also, notice how the candidate invites the
opinion of his partner, by asking 'what do

189
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,069
you think?'

190
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:58,350
This makes the answer even stronger.

191
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:04,689
Let’s look at one more sample question,
but this time we’ll try to add a counterargument.

192
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:10,399
"Some people say that to be healthy on the
inside, you need to start from the outside.

193
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,660
What’s your opinion on this?"

194
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,050
Here’s a sample answer:

195
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,709
"For sure, I think that it’s important to
be physically healthy as it affects the way

196
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:20,740
you feel."

197
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,509
This answer is too short.

198
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,610
Can you think of a counterargument to add?

199
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,829
"Of course, it works the other way too.

200
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:34,050
In my opinion, being happy and satisfied with
your life can affect your physical health

201
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,500
too.

202
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,160
Being stressed for a long time can make a
person sick."

203
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:45,860
Adding counterarguments allows you to use
linking words and discourse markers like 'of

204
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,339
course' or 'in my opinion.'

205
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:53,470
Finally, remember that you are also interacting
with your partner.

206
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,480
Don’t just develop your own answers; build
on what your partner says, too!

207
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,579
You can do this in the same way.

208
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:07,029
Comment on your partner’s answers and add
your own details, suggestions and counterarguments,

209
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:08,040
just like we did here.

210
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,860
Let’s look at one more general tip which
can help you, especially during part four:

211
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,399
get informed

212
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,540
Some people are already good at expressing
their opinions.

213
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,810
But some of us don’t feel confident doing
this, especially in a second language.

214
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:27,829
When you take a speaking exam like CAE, it’s
not just about English.

215
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:33,290
It’s about your ideas and opinions, and
how well you can communicate them to others.

216
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:39,670
This is a more general tip, but reading widely,
keeping up with the news and thinking about

217
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,779
current affairs can help you in your CAE speaking
exam.

218
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:50,940
Read news and opinion articles on news sites
such as the BBC, Al Jazeera and so on.

219
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,709
Of course, it’s better to read in English,
but you could also read in your own language.

220
00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:00,290
The goal is to expose yourself to as many
different opinions as possible.

221
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:05,660
The good news is, even if you don’t have
a lot of time until your exam, you can give

222
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,620
yourself an advantage by reading current affairs,
and starting to think about what your opinions

223
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,290
are.

224
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,410
When you read, think about what you’re reading
and try to form your own opinions.

225
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,860
This way, you’ll be able to talk about a
wide range of topics, and you’ll have more

226
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:26,190
interesting ideas and opinions you can use
in your CAE speaking test.

227
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,009
Let’s review what we’ve covered today.

228
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:36,890
To improve your score on Parts 3 and 4 of
the CAE speaking exam, these are my top tips:

229
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:37,890
1.

230
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,610
Learn conversation fillers; 2.

231
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,079
Focus on depth and detail; 3.

232
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,480
Make sure you use all the time; 4.

233
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,560
Learn how to agree and disagree; 5.

234
00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:00,699
Bring your partner into the conversation by
asking for his/her opinions; 6.

235
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:07,540
Always develop your ideas; 7.Read widely to
expose yourself to different opinions and

236
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,540
ideas.

237
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:14,269
But I have one more very important tip for
you, and that's to practise!

238
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:18,709
Practise with a friend, with your teacher,
or in class.

239
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:23,759
Use these opportunities to practise agreeing,
disagreeing or using fillers like the ones

240
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,029
we learned today.

241
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:30,509
If you have a friend who is also preparing
for the CAE speaking exam, try to think of

242
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:35,899
your own part three/four questions, or find
some online, and just practise, practise and

243
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:36,980
practise them together.

244
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,750
In this lesson, we’ve talked about a lot
of different language structures that you

245
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,750
can use.

246
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:48,860
However, practising with a friend, your teacher,
or in class, is essential.

247
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,940
You can even try to think of your own part
4 type questions, and share them together.

248
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,040
So, that’s the end of the lesson.

249
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,670
Thanks very much for watching, and good luck
for your CAE speaking test!
