00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,090
Hi, I’m Gina.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,779
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:11,250
In this lesson, you’ll see how to make a
study plan to prepare for the IELTS exam.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,200
You’ll see a six-step plan which anyone
can follow.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,650
You’ll learn how to prepare for the different
parts of the IELTS exam, and you’ll also

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,699
see useful books and resources to make your
IELTS preparation easier and more effective.

7
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,259
If you need extra help with your IELTS, don’t
forget to check out our website: Oxford Online

8
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,560
English dot com.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,980
Our teachers can help you to prepare for the
IELTS exam in online classes.

10
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:45,989
We also have many free video and listening
lessons which you can use for IELTS study.

11
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,810
Now, let’s see the first part of your IELTS
preparation plan.

12
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,550
Step one: take a practice IELTS test.

13
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,010
You can find practice tests on the British
Council website.

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,640
There’s a link in the video description
if you’re watching on YouTube.

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,200
If you’re watching on our website, you can
find the link underneath the video.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,110
Do the listening and reading, check your answers,
and work out your score.

17
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:22,030
Do the practice test under exam conditions,
meaning that you work with a time limit, and

18
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,920
without a dictionary or any help.

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,780
For the speaking and writing, it’s best
to do the practice test with a teacher, so

20
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,170
that you can get accurate feedback on your
level.

21
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,230
It’s difficult to assess your own speaking
and writing.

22
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,700
If you can’t do this, then do a practice
writing exam by yourself.

23
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,549
See how it feels.

24
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:48,180
Could you finish everything in the time limit?

25
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,500
Did you write enough words?

26
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,159
Come back to your answer a few days later—is
it clear?

27
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,149
Does it cover all the necessary information?

28
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:03,729
To do the speaking by yourself, record yourself
answering the questions in a practice speaking

29
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:04,859
exam.

30
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:10,330
Remember: you can find all these materials
on the British Council website, in the link

31
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,010
which is under the video.

32
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,980
Record your answers, then listen back.

33
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,540
Could you answer the questions fluently?

34
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,150
Did you hesitate or pause a lot?

35
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,760
Could you give developed, detailed answers
to all the questions?

36
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,370
Again, it’s difficult to do this alone,
but hopefully you’ll get some idea of your

37
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,110
abilities and weaknesses.

38
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:38,319
You should also read the public IELTS score
schemes—you can find all the links in the

39
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,560
video description.

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,349
Read the score scheme for your target IELTS
band, and read the bands above and below.

41
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:52,430
Think about what it means; what do you need
to do?

42
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,270
Where are you stronger or weaker?

43
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,640
Make a list of your weaknesses in order of
importance.

44
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,950
This will help you with the next step.

45
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,150
Step two: set daily time goals.

46
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,390
First question: how much time can you spend
studying each day?

47
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,739
Be realistic.

48
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:18,709
Second question: how are you going to spend
that time?

49
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:20,650
Think about the list you made in step one.

50
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,660
Obviously, you want to spend more time on
your biggest weaknesses.

51
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,090
If your biggest problem is the writing exam,
then you should spend more time there.

52
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,260
If you’re already above your target band
score for reading, then you probably shouldn’t

53
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,989
spend time on reading practice.

54
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:43,879
You’ll see more details about how to work
on different exam sections later.

55
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,080
For now, just make a general plan.

56
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,750
For example, maybe you have two hours a day
for study.

57
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:56,220
You might decide to spend one hour on the
writing exam, thirty minutes on listening,

58
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,540
and thirty minutes on speaking.

59
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,750
Finally, think about how you can stick to
your target.

60
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,250
How are you going to stay motivated?

61
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:11,500
You could use a habit tracking app on your
phone, or put a calendar on your wall and

62
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,189
tick each day you hit your target.

63
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:19,450
You could also give yourself a reward for
hitting your target regularly.

64
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,580
Think about what will work for you!

65
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,380
Step three: useful books and resources.

66
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:32,940
We’ll remind you once more: links for everything
we mention can be found underneath the video.

67
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,110
Use official resources if possible.

68
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,240
That means resources published by Cambridge
or the British Council.

69
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,320
There’s a lot of free IELTS material available
online; some of it is very good, and some

70
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:48,010
of it isn’t.

71
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,500
If you can’t tell the difference, you could
create problems for yourself.

72
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,980
First, it’s useful to have some practice
IELTS exams.

73
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,350
Cambridge publish books of past exams.

74
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:05,800
These include answer keys, as well as model
answers for some writing questions.

75
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,860
Secondly, get some vocabulary-building resources.

76
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,440
The Cambridge Vocabulary in Use books are
effective and easy to use.

77
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,500
Cambridge also publish a Collocations in Use
series.

78
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:28,000
Collocations are important for your IELTS
score, so we recommend at least getting the

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,960
intermediate book.

80
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,190
Thirdly, get a grammar reference book.

81
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:39,160
The most popular is English Grammar in Use,
also published by Cambridge.

82
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,020
It comes in three levels: elementary, intermediate,
and advanced.

83
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,710
They could all be useful, depending on your
level, but you should definitely have the

84
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,000
intermediate book.

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,840
For writing and speaking, get a teacher if
you possibly can.

86
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,050
You might not want to spend money, but taking
IELTS is expensive, especially if you have

87
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,010
to take it several times.

88
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:10,410
Probably, not getting the IELTS score you
want will cost you something, too.

89
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:16,670
Investing in lessons with a professional teacher
can save you time and money later.

90
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:23,430
Online, IELTS Liz has lots of information
and tips about the IELTS exam, as well as

91
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,220
lists of recent IELTS questions and topics.

92
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:33,990
Also, check out IELTS-Simon, which has lots
of useful advice, especially for the writing

93
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,530
exam.

94
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:40,970
There are other good websites and online resources,
but remember to be careful!

95
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:47,000
There are also lots of sites with low-quality
materials which can give you the wrong idea

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,590
about the IELTS exam.

97
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:54,660
In particular, be careful with sites which
provide model writing answers.

98
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,990
In many cases, the website doesn’t tell
you what band score the model answer would

99
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,590
get.

100
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:08,160
Some sites include model answers which might
score from band six to band eight, but they

101
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,720
don’t indicate which is which.

102
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,740
This is dangerous; you might read an answer
and think it’s a good example, but in a

103
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,990
real IELTS exam it would get band six.

104
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,830
Only look at model writing answers if you
know the band score they would get.

105
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,770
Now, you have the resources you need.

106
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:35,360
Let’s make a detailed study plan for different
exam sections and key skills.

107
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,410
Step four: reading and listening.

108
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,980
Your reading and listening practice should
be divided between three things.

109
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,410
One: do practice tests.

110
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,900
Two: do general reading/listening practice.

111
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:58,860
For example, for reading, you could read newspapers,
blogs, magazines, novels, and so on.

112
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:05,800
For listening, use TV shows, podcasts, films,
or whatever you can find.

113
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,910
Three: learn vocabulary.

114
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,460
Don’t try to do too much.

115
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:18,180
For each thing you read or listen to, try
to learn between five and ten new words or

116
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,180
phrases.

117
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:26,000
These three things are in priority order,
so if your time is limited, focus on practice

118
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,500
tests.

119
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,680
There are other ways to build vocabulary,
so if you don’t have time for vocabulary

120
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,520
building here, don’t worry.

121
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,370
When preparing for IELTS, you also need to
think about how much time you have before

122
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,380
your exam.

123
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,320
Reading and listening are slow skills to build.

124
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,270
To make a significant difference, you need
months of regular work.

125
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:55,410
If you don’t have much time, then make reading
and listening lower priorities.

126
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,550
Do some practice tests, but spend most of
your time on other things.

127
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:07,320
If you have an exam in a few weeks, then you
can’t make big improvements in that time.

128
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,940
Step five: writing

129
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,120
Once again, we really recommend you find a
teacher to help you with the writing exam.

130
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,420
Otherwise, it’s difficult to get feedback,
which is essential to improve.

131
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,320
Either way, here’s how to practise effectively.

132
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,000
There are four steps to good writing practice.

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,130
One: do vocabulary pre-work.

134
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:38,070
For example, are you writing a task 2 essay
about the environment?

135
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:43,260
Use your vocabulary books to learn some words,
phrases and collocations.

136
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,460
Then, try to use these in your answer.

137
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,830
Are you writing a task 1 academic answer describing
a pie chart?

138
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:58,880
Learn some phrases to talk about proportions
and percentages, and try to use them in your

139
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,970
answer.

140
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,970
Don’t try *too* hard to fit all the vocabulary
into your writing.

141
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:11,370
For higher IELTS scores, you need to use vocabulary
naturally.

142
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,520
Accept that you won’t be able to use most
of the vocabulary you learn in one writing

143
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,460
task.

144
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,600
That’s fine!

145
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,720
If you can use even one or two new words or
collocations, that’s useful.

146
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,930
With all vocabulary learning, it’s better
to learn chunks of language.

147
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:38,040
That means: try to learn phrases and sentences,
rather than single words.

148
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,670
Two: write your practice answer.

149
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,920
Do it under exam conditions.

150
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,580
Three: get feedback and do supporting grammar
work if needed.

151
00:10:51,580 --> 00:11:00,420
For example, did you make mistakes with conditional
sentences, or perfect tenses, or prepositions?

152
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,000
Use your grammar reference book and practise
topics which you have problems with.

153
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,920
Also, think about your use of vocabulary.

154
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,800
Did you use the vocabulary you learned before
you started writing?

155
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,000
Did you make mistakes with it?

156
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,820
Were there any places where you couldn’t
find the word or phrase that you needed?

157
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:27,560
Finally, rewrite your answer and try to improve
it.

158
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,970
Try to avoid the grammar mistakes you made
first time.

159
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,250
Try to use a wider range of vocabulary.

160
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,060
Step six: speaking

161
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:43,770
Like writing, speaking practice should be
done with a teacher if possible.

162
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:50,310
If not, then the best way is to record yourself
answering speaking test questions, and then

163
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:56,370
listen to your own answers, and try to find
problems or mistakes.

164
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:04,420
Take a similar approach to writing practice:
do vocabulary pre-work, practise, find mistakes,

165
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:10,950
do supporting grammar work if you need, then
repeat the task and try to improve.

166
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,580
When you’re speaking, it’s better to focus
on one thing at a time.

167
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,560
For example, on one day, you can focus on
fluency.

168
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,900
Try to speak without pausing or hesitating.

169
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:30,120
Record yourself, listen to your speaking,
and count the number of hesitations and pauses.

170
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,480
Repeat the task, and try to get a lower number
of hesitations.

171
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:41,360
Another day, you can focus on using different
verb forms in your speaking.

172
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,200
Record yourself, and count how many different
verb tenses you use.

173
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:53,660
For example, if you use the present simple,
past simple, and past continuous in your answers,

174
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,180
then that’s three.

175
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:03,080
Repeat the same task, and try to use one or
two more verb tenses in your answer.

176
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:08,770
Of course, there are many other things you
need to think about for speaking: intonation,

177
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:16,940
stress, grammatical accuracy, using different
sentence forms, using linking words, and so

178
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,940
on.

179
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,920
However, it’s better to focus on one thing
at a time.

180
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,340
With speaking and writing, practising by yourself
will only be effective if your English is

181
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,940
already quite high-level.

182
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,190
If your English is at a lower level, you won’t
be able to find many of the mistakes and problems

183
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,960
which you have.

184
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,800
In this case, you need a teacher to help you.

185
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,750
And, that’s it!

186
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:49,310
Follow this six-step study plan to prepare
for IELTS efficiently and effectively.

187
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,240
Be flexible and adjust your plan as you go.

188
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,480
You might need to spend more time than you
thought.

189
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,050
You might realise that the writing exam needs
more work, and so you need to spend more of

190
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,620
your daily time working on that.

191
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,620
What about you?

192
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,710
Do you have any useful IELTS study suggestions?

194
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:18,790

up soon.

195
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,930

196
