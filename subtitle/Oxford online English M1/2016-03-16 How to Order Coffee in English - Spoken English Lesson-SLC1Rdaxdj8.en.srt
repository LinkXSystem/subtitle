00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,250
Hi.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,390
My name is Rheedan.

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,660
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,170
Today, we're going to learn some important
words and phrases, so that you can order your

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,300
next cup of coffee in English.

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,110
Do you often go for coffee?

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,930
Do you know how to order different types of
coffee in English?

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,810
You'll learn how in this lesson.

9
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,060
Let's first look at some words you'll need
to know when ordering your morning cup.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,480
At a coffee shop, drinks are usually made
from espresso.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,039
An espresso is a small amount of very strong
coffee.

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,860
This small amount is called a shot.

13
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,390
This espresso is then drunk on its own or
mixed in different ways to make the different

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,800
coffee drinks.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,120
Here are some of the most common.

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,590
Americano: espresso with hot water.

17
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,719
Cappuccino: espresso and steamed milk, with
foamed milk or cream on top.

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,520
Latte: espresso with lots of steamed milk.

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,859
Mocha: espresso, hot chocolate, and steamed
milk, sometimes with cream on top.

20
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,969
Which of these types of coffee have you tried?

21
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:06,299
Personally, I like lattes.

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,140
You can also have your coffee with different
kinds of milk, like low-fat, fat-free, or

23
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,140
soy.

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,909
If you want coffee without milk, ask for a
black coffee.

25
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:22,510
Some people also like to have things added
to their coffee, like caramel, chocolate,

26
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,250
or vanilla syrup, or cream.

27
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,460
You can even have an extra shot of espresso
added.

28
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,730
You also have a choice of sizes.

29
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:36,170
You can get a small, medium, large, or extra
large.

30
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,710
Many coffee shops have their own names for
these sizes, but you don't need to know or

31
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,950
use them.

32
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,170
Just using these sizes will work.

33
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:50,079
How to order coffee: when giving your order,
you usually say the size first, then the type

34
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,409
of coffee, and then the type of milk or extras.

35
00:01:53,409 --> 00:02:00,860
For example, "Small cappuccino with caramel
syrup" or, "Medium mocha without cream."

36
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:06,079
If you want a cold drink, you add the word
"iced" before the type of coffee.

37
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:12,739
For example, "Large iced latte with low-fat
milk" or, "Medium iced Americano."

38
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:16,690
Placing your order: a barista is someone who
makes coffee.

39
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,790
They will usually take your order.

40
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,459
There are a few things they can say, such
as, "May I take your order?"

41
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,760
"What would you like?"

42
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,870
"What can I get you?"

43
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,340
"What will you have?"

44
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,010
You can answer in a few different ways.

45
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:39,370
You can say, "I would like . . ." "I'll have
. . ." or, "Can I get . . .?" Then you give

46
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,760
your order: "I'll have an Americano with vanilla
syrup."

47
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,910
Or, "Can I get a latte with extra cream, please?"

48
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,380
What's this order missing?

49
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,220
If you make an order like this, the first
question you will be asked is, "What size

50
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,220
would you like?"

51
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,500
"What size will that be?"

52
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:02,140
Another question you might hear when making
your order is, "Is that for here or to take

53
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,270
away?"

54
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:08,269
You can answer, "For here," "To take away,"
or, "To go."

55
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:11,260
You can also add this information to your
order.

56
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,850
What does that look like?

57
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:19,360
When you order, you can just say, "I'd like
a small mocha without cream to go," or, "I'll

58
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,550
have a medium iced latte with vanilla syrup,
for here."

59
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,750
After you order, the barista might say, "Will
that be all?"

60
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,150
"Is that everything?"

61
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,739
"Would you like anything else?"

62
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,290
Finally, the barista will tell you the total
cost.

63
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:42,980
"Your total is . . ." "That comes to . . ." "That
will be . . ." When handing over your money,

64
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,950
you can say, "Here you are," or, "Here you
go."

65
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,310
Once you've paid, you'll both say, "Thank
you," and that's it.

66
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,000
You've just successfully ordered coffee in
English.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,730
Let's look at a sample dialogue.

68
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,730
"Hi.

69
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,020
What'll you have?"

70
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,069
"I"d like a large latte."

71
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:01,810
"Will that be all?"

72
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,489
"Yes, thank you."

73
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:04,800
"Is that for here?

74
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Or to go?"

75
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
"To go."

76
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,960
"Your total comes to $4."

77
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,340
"Here you go."

78
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,480
"Thanks very much."

79
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,549
"Thank you.

80
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:14,010
Have a nice day."

81
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,750
Let's look at one more.

82
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,750
"Hi.

83
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,859
What can I get you?"

84
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:22,850
"I'll have a small mocha with cream and a
small cappuccino, for here."

85
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,639
"Would you like anything else?"

86
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,220
"Yes, I'd also like an espresso."

87
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,550
"Is that everything?"

88
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,550
"Yes."

89
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,440
"That will be six pounds."

90
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,880
"Here you go."

91
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,060
"Here's your change."

92
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,070
"Thanks."

93
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,770
"Thanks very much."

94
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,240
There you go.

95
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,590
Now you'll be able to order your next cup
of coffee in English.

96
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,860
Want more practice?

97
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,530
Look at the full lesson on our website, oxfordonlineenglish.com.

98
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,530
That's it from me.

99
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,660
I hope the lesson helped.

100
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,640
See you next time!
