1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,610
Hello.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,610
I'm Oli.

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,730
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,340
In this lesson, you can learn about using
colons and semicolons in writing.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,219
First, let's look at using colons.

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:21,130
Colons have one main job: they introduce specific
examples or explanations.

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,130
Let's look.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,910
He had one problem: there was no way to get
there in time.

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,690
So in this sentence, we mention something
general in the first part of the sentence,

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,030
a problem.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,970
Then we give specific details in the second
part, after the colon.

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:43,100
There's just one rule here: do everything
I tell you.

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,489
Again, we mention something general in the
first part, one rule.

14
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:53,240
Then we say what it is, specifically, in the
second part of the sentence.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:59,899
A good way to remember this is that we put
a general idea before the colon and then give

16
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:06,580
a specific example or a more detailed explanation
after the colon.

17
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,680
You can also use colons to introduce a list
of items.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:18,580
For example, "We've invited a small number
of people: Bill, Emma, Rachel," and so on.

19
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:27,380
Or, "Tolstoy wrote several books, other than
'War and Peace': 'Anna Karenina', 'The Cossacks',

20
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,049
'Resurrection'," and so on.

21
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:38,040
Finally, you can use colons to introduce speech
in quotes, like, "He said: 'Don't talk to

22
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,970
me about this again,'" or, "They shouted:
'Be careful.

23
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,320
Don't get too close to the edge.'"

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,800
In this case, it's not necessary to use a
colon.

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,400
You can also use a comma.

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,430
There's no difference in which you use.

27
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,020
It's mostly a question of personal style.

28
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,900
After a colon, it's possible to use a small
letter or a capital letter.

29
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:10,840
If you use a colon to introduce what someone
said, you should generally use a capital letter.

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,150
If you use a colon to introduce an example
or an explanation, you can choose to use a

31
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,810
small letter or a capital.

32
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:25,150
Using a capital letter is more common in American
English, while in UK English, we almost always

33
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,360
use a small letter.

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,260
Next, let's look at when not to use a colon.

35
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:40,590
We said that a colon has one main job: introducing
specific examples or specific explanations.

36
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:47,230
We also said that a colon has one possible
use, which is introducing what someone said.

37
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,190
It's also important to know when not to use
a colon.

38
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,040
Here are some common mistakes which English
learners sometimes make with colon use.

39
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,350
First, don't use a colon at the beginning
of a letter or an email, for example, after

40
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,910
someone's name.

41
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,000
Use a comma instead.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,130
Also, don't use a colon after a title or a
heading, for example, at the top of an essay

43
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,790
or an article or anything like that.

44
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,160
You don't normally need any punctuation at
the end of the title.

45
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,800
Next, let's look at using a semicolon.

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,630
Like a colon, a semicolon has one main use.

47
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,170
We use it to show a connection between two
complete sentences.

48
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,050
A semicolon is actually similar to a full
stop.

49
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:39,480
It's generally the writer's choice whether
to use a full stop or a semicolon.

50
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,790
A semicolon is used instead of a full stop
because the writer wants to show that two

51
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,840
ideas are more closely connected.

52
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,760
For example, "The population of Shanghai is
around 24 million; Beijing has around 22 million

53
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
people."

54
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,909
Our second example, "We knew he was guilty;
There was no evidence, however."

55
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:08,700
You can see in both of these examples that
the parts before and after the semicolon could

56
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,160
both be full sentences.

57
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:18,419
So we could use a full stop in the first sentence,
after 24 million, and then start a new sentence

58
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:20,180
with the word "Beijing."

59
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,329
That would be possible.

60
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:26,780
Also, in the second sentence, we could use
a full stop after "guilty," and then start

61
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,229
a new sentence.

62
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:35,309
The second important point is that both parts
of the sentence, before and after the semicolon,

63
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:38,800
are talking about a related topic.

64
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,810
In the first example, both parts of the sentence
are about the population of Chinese cities.

65
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:50,039
In the second, both parts are obviously about
the same criminal case and the same person.

66
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:56,610
So we use a semicolon to show that two ideas
or two sentences are very closely related

67
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,520
or talking about the same topic.

68
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,550
Often, when we want to join two sentences
in English, we use a connecting word, like

69
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,870
"and" or "but" or "therefore," for example.

70
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,520
When you join two sentences using a semicolon,
you don't need to use a connecting word.

71
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,229
However, if you use a connecting word to join
two sentences, you sometimes need to use a

72
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:25,309
semicolon and sometimes a comma.

73
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:29,139
It depends what the connecting word is.

74
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:37,389
To join sentences using "and," "or," "but,"
"yet," or "while," you should use a comma.

75
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:44,979
To join two sentences using "however," "therefore,"
"nevertheless," or "meanwhile," you should

76
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:47,550
use a semicolon.

77
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,139
These lists are not complete.

78
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,789
There are other connecting words which require
a comma or a semicolon.

79
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:59,729
However, these are the most common, and the
most important thing is to remember that for

80
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:05,770
some connecting words, you need to use a comma,
and for others, you have to use a semicolon.

81
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:11,039
So here's our example from before, about the
population of Shanghai or Beijing.

82
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,110
In this case, there's no connecting word.

83
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,919
There's no word like "but" or "and" or "however."

84
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,249
So we use a semicolon.

85
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:23,759
OK, here's the same sentence, but a little
bit different.

86
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,539
In this case, we're using the connecting word
"while."

87
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,059
With "while," we need to use a comma.

88
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:36,259
We can't use a semicolon in this case.

89
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:38,039
Another example.

90
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,210
This time, we use the connecting word "however."

91
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:46,710
"However" is used with a semicolon.

92
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:52,719
A full stop would also be possible.

93
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:58,349
Semicolons have one other use: they can be
used in lists when the items on the lists

94
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:00,949
contain commas.

95
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:06,229
Usually when we make a list, we use commas
to separate the items on the list.

96
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:12,580
For example, "We need milk, eggs, sugar, and
flour."

97
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,349
We put a comma after each item, after milk,
after eggs, and so on.

98
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:25,349
But if the items on your list are not just
words, but phrases which include commas, we

99
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:29,209
use semicolons to separate the items on the
list.

100
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:30,209
Let's take a look.

101
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:37,449
"We traveled to four cities: Santa Fe, which
is in New Mexico; Denver, Colorado; Las Vegas,

102
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:41,149
Nevada; and finally, Los Angeles in California."

103
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:46,949
In this case, we use semicolons to separate
the items on the list because the items on

104
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:49,559
the list already include commas.

105
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:55,739
If we used commas to separate the items, it
would be very confusing and difficult to read.

106
00:07:55,739 --> 00:07:57,710
Let's look at one more example.

107
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:04,919
"Only three people showed up: Tom, the head
of accounting; Maria, who works in the sales

108
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:09,439
department; and Ellie, who's doing an internship
here."

109
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,099
Again, the items on the list are phrases which
include commas.

110
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:20,080
So it's much clearer to use semicolons to
separate the parts of the list.

111
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,339
So both the colon and the semicolon are used
to show a connection between two ideas, but

112
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,149
they operate in a very different way.

113
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:33,039
Let's finish by comparing the colon and the
semicolon directly.

114
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,930
So in these three examples, the only difference
is the punctuation, but it does make a big

115
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,779
difference to the meaning.

116
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:44,750
In the first case, the full stop shows that
there is no necessary connection between these

117
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,190
two ideas.

118
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,279
We have a problem, and he isn't doing enough
to help me.

119
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,639
These could be totally separate things.

120
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:57,720
In the second case, with the semicolon, it
shows that the ideas are related somehow.

121
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,860
I'm talking about the same topic.

122
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:07,340
In the third sentence with the colon, we mean
that the problem is his attitude.

123
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,610
The problem is that he isn't doing enough
to help.

124
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:16,089
To make this clearer, let's put these sentences
in other words.

125
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:21,759
In the first case, with the semicolon, we
could also say, "We have a problem, and he

126
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,149
isn't doing enough to help me with this problem."

127
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:32,020
In the sentence with the colon, we could also
say, "We have a problem, which is that he

128
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,650
isn't doing enough to help me."

129
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,399
If you can understand the difference here,
that's a good sign.

130
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,560
It means you really understand the difference
between colons and semicolons.

131
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,750
OK, that's the end of the lesson.

132
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,209
I hope it was useful.

133
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,709
If you're watching on YouTube, I suggest you

understood.

137
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,860
That's all, thank you again for watching,
and I'll see you next time.

138
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,309
Bye bye!
