00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:05,550
Hi, I'm Niamh and welcome to Oxford Online
English.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:13,090
In this lesson, you can learn how to answer
one of the questions in Part Two of the FCE

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,219
Writing Exam: Writing a review.

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:24,289
For many people, the writing section is the
most challenging part of the FCE test.

5
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:30,529
In this lesson, you’ll see a step-by-step
process for writing a review.

6
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:39,430
You’ll see exactly what to do at each stage
and how to improve your FCE writing score.

7
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:45,750
Let’s look at a sample question:

8
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,539
Book reviews wanted
Have your read a book recently that you couldn’t

9
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,090
put down?

10
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,450
Write a review of the book.

11
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,839
Say why you liked it and who you would recommend
it to.

12
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:02,440
The best reviews will be published in the
magazine.

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,600
There are four steps to writing an effective
answer.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,640
So, what’s the first step?

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,820
Read the question and identify exactly what
the examiners want from you.

16
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,580
Your FCE writing is assessed on four points:

17
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,750
First, let’s focus on content.

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,930
To get five marks for content you need to
make sure, “all content is relevant and

19
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,950
the reader is fully informed.”

20
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:39,130
Those aren’t my words—those are the words
from the official mark scheme!

21
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,970
But what do they mean?

22
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:49,480
Very simple: they mean you need to do everything
the question asks you to do.

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,630
Look at our sample question again.

24
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:03,660
There are three things you need to include
in this task; Do you know what they are?

25
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:09,110
Number one: you need to write a review of
a book.

26
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:16,440
This means you should include some basic information
about the book, like its title, the author,

27
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,400
and what genre it is: crime, historical, romance,
etc.

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,050
Number two: say why you liked it.

29
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,840
Finally, say who you would recommend it to.

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,530
Easy, right?

31
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,940
Yes and no.

32
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:40,500
It’s simple, but most people don’t get
full marks for content.

33
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,630
You should aim to get five out of five.

34
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,510
Here’s how you do this:

35
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,740
One: make sure you cover everything fully.

36
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,060
Don’t leave any parts of the question out!

37
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,830
Two: make sure you cover everything equally.

38
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,800
In this question, there are three points to
include.

39
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,819
You should have a more-or-less equal number
of words for each point.

40
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:14,050
Three: make sure you support your ideas with
reasons or details.

41
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:20,360
Four: don’t include anything unnecessary
or irrelevant.

42
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,310
Your task is to do what the question asks,
and nothing more!

43
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:31,150
Now, you’ve identified the three things
you need to include.

44
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:38,360
You can move on to step two: planning!

45
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,260
Planning is the most important step.

46
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,450
The FCE writing test is one hour 20 minutes
long.

47
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:54,569
Parts one and two are worth equal marks, twenty
each, so you should spend about 40 minutes

48
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:55,569
on each.

49
00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:04,010
Of those 40 minutes, you should spend five
to ten minutes on planning.

50
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,060
It can be tempting to think, “I need all
of that time to write!

51
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,140
I don’t have time to plan!”

52
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,599
However, this is a bad idea.

53
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:21,299
Not planning your writing is like going on
a journey without map: you’re likely to

54
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:23,139
get lost.

55
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:29,259
Planning is especially important for your
organisation score.

56
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:36,220
Your writing needs to be well-structured and
coherent to earn marks in this area.

57
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,200
So, when you’re planning, think about questions
like this:

58
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:46,960
What kind of language should you use: formal,
neutral or informal?

59
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,400
Do you need a title or subheadings?

60
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,090
How should you organise your text?

61
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,849
Do you need an introduction or conclusion?

62
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:01,690
The answers to these questions will depend
on the exact task.

63
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:09,979
For a book review, it should probably have
a title, but it doesn’t need sub-headings.

64
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:17,900
It should be written in a neutral style, and
it should use specific language for the task:

65
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:24,639
for example to describe books, or make recommendations.

66
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,379
You don’t really need an introduction or
a conclusion, because it’s not an essay;

67
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:33,009
you’re not trying to prove anything.

68
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:38,650
Now, let’s make a basic plan together.

69
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:45,189
When you plan, you need to decide how many
paragraphs you’ll have, and what main idea

70
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,770
will go in each paragraph.

71
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,430
How many paragraphs do you think you’ll
need?

72
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:59,410
There isn’t one right way to do this, but
you have three main points to include for

73
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,249
your content score.

74
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:10,069
So, it makes sense to have three paragraphs,
and an extra paragraph to explain what happens

75
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,190
in the book, like this:

76
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,809
Basic information about the book
What happens in the book

77
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:19,970
Why you liked it
Recommendation

78
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,309
Remember: this isn’t the only possibility.

79
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:29,139
A different structure might make more sense
for you.

80
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:34,680
That’s fine; just make sure the structure
is clear in your head.

81
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,599
‘Clear’ means that each paragraph has
one main point, and you know exactly what

82
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:44,430
that main point is.

83
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,949
After you have your basic outline, you should
add some key words or phrases to each point.

84
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:57,620
A book I read recently was ‘Breakfast at
Tiffany’s’ by Truman Capote.

85
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,710
Maybe you’ve read it, or perhaps you’ve
seen the film!

86
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,860
So, here’s my plan.

87
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,920
You don’t need full sentences, just an idea
of what you’re going to say.

88
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,900
Pause the video if you want some more time
to read the plan.

89
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,699
Okay, now it’s time to write your answer!

90
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,400
You have between 140 and 190 words.

91
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,240
Count the number of words you write in your
practice answers so you can get a feel for

92
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,020
how much to write.

93
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,500
Ready?

94
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,100
OK.

95
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,120
Here’s our first draft.

96
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:46,180
Pause the video for as long as you need to
read it.

97
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,520
How does it look to you?

98
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,899
It’s not bad but it’s not perfect either.

99
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:59,050
Now for the last step!

100
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,770
Try to leave two to three minutes at the end
to check your work.

101
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,110
It can make a difference to your score, so
it’s important!

102
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:14,949
This is where you can improve your score in
the ‘language’ section of the assessment.

103
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:21,110
To get a high language score, you need to
“use a range of vocabulary, including less

104
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:29,199
common vocabulary,” “use a range of simple
and complex grammatical forms,” and make

105
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,780
only “occasional errors.”

106
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:39,600
Again, these are direct quotes from the Cambridge
mark scheme.

107
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:45,290
There will be mistakes and things you can
improve in your writing.

108
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,630
Look at our model review again.

109
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:55,740
There are at least seven things which could
be changed in this answer.

110
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,430
Can you find what they are?

111
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,870
Here are some questions to help you:

112
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,600
Have you forgotten to include anything?

113
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,519
Is all the punctuation, grammar and spelling
correct?

114
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:19,990
Can you replace very common words with more
interesting, specific vocabulary?

115
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:26,220
Have you used linking words and phrases to
make it easy for your reader to follow?

116
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,120
Are you within the word count?

117
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,310
These are questions you can ask yourself after
you’ve finished your own practice answers.

118
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,620
Pause the video and read our answer.

119
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,240
See how many things you can find.

120
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,990
First, did you notice I forgot to include
a title?

121
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:55,410
A book review in a magazine or a newspaper
normally has a title, so our review should

122
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,680
have one, too.

123
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,540
What else could I have done better?

124
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,860
I've underlined a few things in my answer.

125
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,040
Can you improve them?

126
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,620
Okay, let’s see how you did!

127
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:20,149
First, titles of books and movies are normally
written in italics or placed inside speech

128
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:21,149
marks.

129
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:25,760
Let’s put it inside single speech marks
here.

130
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:34,240
Then, in the 2nd paragraph, 1940s should not
have an apostrophe.

131
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,790
In the third paragraph, I’ve repeated who
lives downstairs which I said in the second

132
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,790
paragraph.

133
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,380
Can you think of another way to say this?

134
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:53,600
You could say …who rents the apartment downstairs,
…who lives in the apartment below his, or

135
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,770
…who is a tenant in the apartment downstairs.

136
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:03,310
This shows a greater range of vocabulary and
will improve your language score.

137
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:11,420
The next one is similar: can you think of
a synonym for more difficult?

138
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,040
How about more challenging?

139
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:23,019
More difficult is not wrong, but more challenging
is a less common and more specific word.

140
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:28,850
If you show a range of language, you’ll
get more marks for your language score.

141
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,560
Next, behavior.

142
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,550
Why is this underlined?

143
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,990
Behavior is the American spelling.

144
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:45,870
It’s fine to use American spelling, but
you must be consistent!

145
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,720
Earlier I spelt travelled with two l’s,
which is British spelling.

146
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:58,569
I need to change one, so let’s change behaviour
to the UK spelling by adding a ‘u’:

147
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:05,670
Next, let’s look at the gap at the start
of the last paragraph.

148
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,870
What do you think we could add here?

149
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,290
You could add a linking word or phrase.

150
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,750
It would make it much easier for the reader
to follow.

151
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,269
You would also improve your organisation score.

152
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:23,319
You have a few options.

153
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:24,910
For example:

154
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,040
To sum up
Overall

155
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,009
All in all

156
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:32,639
What about in conclusion?

157
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,930
Would it be a good choice?

158
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,610
Maybe, but it’s not ideal.

159
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,130
It’s too formal!

160
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:45,449
Save this one for your essay and keep your
review in a neutral style.

161
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:52,620
Finally, what’s wrong with I’d recommend
it teenagers?

162
00:12:52,620 --> 00:13:02,149
Remember after recommend you need the proposition
to: recommend something to someone.

163
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:08,910
By correcting these errors and making these
improvements, you could improve your FCE writing

164
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,079
score without very much work.

165
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:21,670
We used this process to write a review, but
