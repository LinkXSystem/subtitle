00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,640
Hi, I’m Gina. Welcome to Oxford Online English!\h\h

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:13,040
In this lesson, you can learn to talk about crime\h
in English. You’ll learn vocabulary you can use\h\h

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,000
to talk about crime, criminals\h
and the justice system in English.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,920
Before we begin, check out our website: Oxford\h

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,720
We can do that, too! Oxford\h

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,160
Let’s start with part one, where you’ll hear a\h
conversation about being a victim of a crime.\h

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,760
How was your trip?

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,600
My trip was good… But my house\h
was burgled while I was gone.

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,720
Oh no!

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,440
Yeah… I came back to find the back window\h
broken, and everything was messed up inside.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,520
I’m so sorry to hear that.\h
Do you know when it happened?

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,240
Not exactly. Apparently there have been\h
several break-ins in the area recently, though.

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,000
Did they take much stuff?

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,120
Some electronics, a laptop, a few other\h
small things. It’s all replaceable,\h\h

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,120
but it’s still not a good feeling.

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,440
I’m sure. Still, maybe the police will\h
catch them and you’ll get it back.

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,640
Maybe, but I doubt it. They\h
came and dusted for prints,\h\h

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,000
but they said that there was almost\h
no chance of recovering my things.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,500
Really?

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,680
They say that stolen goods tend to be moved\h
out of the city and sold somewhere else,\h\h

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,920
so they’re very difficult to trace. The\h
detective told me that there’s a whole\h\h

24
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,320
network of fences around the country,\h
and they move stolen items between them.

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,320
Sounds like big business.

26
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,840
Look at a sentence you heard\h
at the start of the dialogue.\h

27
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:02,240
Do you remember the missing word?
The word was ‘burgled’, from the verb ‘to burgle’.

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,840
With crime vocabulary, you often\h
need to learn words in threes.\h

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,800
Do you know the noun forms?
Here they are.\h

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,120
You need to know one noun for the person,\h
one noun for the activity, and the verb.

31
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,680
Sometimes, some of the forms might be the\h
same. For example: murder, murderer, murder.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,920
Sometimes, one of the forms might be a completely\h
different word, like this: steal, thief, stealing.\h

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,840
Keep this in mind when learning crime vocabulary.

34
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,640
Let’s look at some other useful\h
vocabulary from the dialogue.\h

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:03,840
Here’s a task for you: look at the definitions.\h
Can you match the words to the definitions?

36
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:13,040
Pause the video and find your answers.
Could you do it? Let’s look!\h

37
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:22,400
‘Break-in’ and ‘burglary’ have a similar meaning;\h
you could use either word in this sentence.\h

38
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,720
‘Fence’ is a colloquial word,\h
but it’s useful sometimes\h\h

39
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,840
as there’s no single word with the same meaning.

40
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,920
Let’s move on to part two. Don’t forget that\h
you can always review a dialogue or a section\h\h

41
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,360
as many times as you need.

42
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,800
That was fun!

43
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,400
Yes, we should do it again some time.

44
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,680
By the way, how are you getting home?

45
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,560
I’ll walk through the park,\h
and then get the bus, I think.

46
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,520
Maybe get a taxi instead? My colleague\h
was mugged near here last week.

47
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,720
Really? I didn’t think there\h
was much street crime here.

48
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,000
No, me neither, but it’s better to be careful.\h\h

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,400
She was robbed at knifepoint.\h
She’s fine but it was scary.

50
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,240
I bet. I know there’s a lot of\h
pickpocketing on public transport\h\h

51
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,680
here, but I didn’t think\h
there was much violent crime.

52
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,320
Well, maybe it was just bad luck,\h
but better to be safe, I think.

53
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,160
Yeah, I’ll get a taxi.

54
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,880
Let’s see if you can remember the key\h
vocabulary you heard. Look at some sentences.

55
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,080
Can you remember the missing words?\h
Pause the video and think about it.\h\h

56
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,160
If you want, go back and listen to\h
the dialogues again, and find them!\h

57
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,560
Ready? Let’s look.\h

58
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,240
Did you get them right? Next,\h
can you explain what they mean?\h

59
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,640
Mugging is a kind of robbery. In general,\h
‘robbery’ means stealing by using violence or the\h\h

60
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:09,840
threat of violence. Mugging is robbery which takes\h
place on the street, or in another public place.\h

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,200
‘Street crime’ includes crimes like mugging,\h\h

62
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:23,840
pickpocketing, graffiti, and so on. In general,\h
it refers to crimes which are committed in public.\h

63
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,040
‘She was robbed at knifepoint’ means that someone\h
threatened her with a knife. You can also use the\h\h

64
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,840
word ‘gunpoint’. For example, ‘The gang held\h
the bank staff at gunpoint during the robbery.’\h

65
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,720
Pickpocketing means stealing from someone’s bag\h
or wallet, usually in a crowded public place.\h

66
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,760
Here’s an important point: in English, there\h
are many different words for different types\h\h

67
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,760
of stealing. You’ve heard some of\h
them already: burglary, robbery,\h\h

68
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,280
mugging and pickpocketing. There’s also\h
shoplifting which means stealing from shops.

69
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,680
It’s more common to use these\h
specific words when possible,\h\h

70
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,560
instead of using general words like ‘stealing’.

71
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:19,920
Don’t forget also to learn the three words for\h
each crime. For example: mug, mugger, mugging.\h

72
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,560
Is there much street crime or\h
pickpocketing where you live?\h\h

73
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,160
How can you protect yourself from this?\h
Think about what you could say on this topic.\h

74
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,840
OK? Let’s move on.

75
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,600
Where’s John? He’s twenty minutes late!

76
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,280
He probably underestimated how long\h
it would take to get here on the bus.

77
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,120
Why’s he taking the bus?

78
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,280
Oh, you didn’t hear? He was done for DUI.

79
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,080
No way!

80
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,200
Yeah. He got a twelve-month driving ban, and\h
he has to do some community service, too.

81
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,440
Wow! He’s such a car nut, too.\h
That must really hurt him.

82
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,480
I’m sure. I think it’s worse because he\h
got a couple of speeding tickets last year,\h\h

83
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,520
so he already had some points on his license.

84
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,760
Well, he can’t really complain.

85
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:18,880
Let’s see three sentences from the dialogue.
What do these phrases mean? Could you explain\h\h

86
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,400
them to someone?
Try it now.\h

87
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,320
Try to complete these sentences. Pause\h
the video and say your answers out loud,\h\h

88
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:36,720
or write them down, or both.
Could you do it? Let’s check!

89
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,200
‘Done’ is British slang. It means ‘convicted’,\h
meaning that you are found guilty in court. ‘DUI’\h\h

90
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,760
stands for ‘driving under the influence’,\h
which means driving while drunk or on drugs.

91
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:58,000
If you wanted to say this in a more formal\h
way, you could say ‘He was convicted of DUI’.

92
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,640
If you want to say this in a neutral style,\h
you could say ‘He was arrested for DUI.’

93
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,080
‘Arrested’ and ‘convicted’ aren’t the\h
same. ‘Arrested’ means when the police\h\h

94
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,840
first find you and take you to the police station.\h
‘Convicted’ is when you are found guilty in court.\h\h

95
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,400
However, in everyday conversation, people\h
might not use these words so precisely.\h\h

96
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,840
People might say ‘arrested’ when the\h
real meaning is ‘convicted in court’.\h

97
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,720
A driving ban means that you are forbidden\h
from driving for a period of time.\h

98
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,680
Community service is a punishment,\h
usually for less serious crimes.\h\h

99
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,960
It means you have to spend a certain\h
number of hours working for free.\h\h

100
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,040
For example, you might have to\h
pick up litter on the street.\h

101
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,040
If you have points on your license, you have been\h
caught breaking the law while driving before.\h\h

102
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:02,400
Many countries use a points system. If\h
you, for example, break the speed limit\h\h

103
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,640
and the police catch you, you get points on\h
your license. If you get too many points,\h\h

104
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,120
you might lose your driver’s license, or you\h
might be banned from driving for some time.

105
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:26,160
Clear? To practise, try answering some questions.
Think about your answers to these questions.\h\h

106
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,400
Pause the video, make your answers, and say\h
them out loud. If you want extra practice,\h\h

107
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,840
write your answers in the comments\h
and share them with other learners!\h

108
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,640
Could you do it? Great!\h
Let’s look at one more point.\h

109
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,960
Before you listen to the dialogue,\h
we have a challenge for you:\h\h

110
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,640
try to find words with these\h
meanings in the dialogue.\h

111
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,520
Got it? Try to find these words as you listen.

112
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,840
Could I ask a favour? Could I\h
take half a day off on Wednesday?

113
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,880
Should be OK. Can I ask what it’s for?

114
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,200
Well… I have a friend who\h
was arrested for shoplifting.\h\h

115
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,360
She says she didn’t do it, and\h
for what it’s worth I believe her,\h\h

116
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,200
but anyway, Wednesday is her court date\h
and I said I’d go along to support her.

117
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,080
Sure, no problem. How long is the trial?

118
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,560
It’s at the magistrates’ court, so as I understand\h\h

119
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,200
it it’s pretty quick. It’s not a\h
full trial with a jury and so on.

120
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,560
Do you think she’ll get off?

121
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,280
I don’t know. Even if not, she has a\h
clean record so I don’t think she’ll\h\h

122
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,480
get more than a slap on the\h
wrist, figuratively speaking.

123
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,360
Yes, I mean, I don’t think people\h
go to prison for shoplifting, right?

124
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,000
I don’t think so. At least, not\h
for a first offense. Anyway,\h\h

125
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,880
that’s not really my concern. I’m just going\h
to support her, and whatever happens, happens.

126
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,677
Before you listen to the dialogue,\h
we have a challenge for you: try to\h\h

127
00:10:55,677 --> 00:10:56,720
find words with these meanings in the dialogue.
Got it? Try to find these words as you listen.\h

128
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,840
Could you do it? Let’s see the answers.

129
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:07,040
‘Get off’ is slang. More formally,\h
you could say ‘be found innocent’.\h\h

130
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,240
So, in the dialogue I
asked ‘Do you think she’ll get off?’\h\h

131
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,520
In formal English, you’d say ‘Do\h
you think she’ll be found innocent?’\h

132
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,360
‘A slap on the wrist’ is an idiom. Often, it’s\h
used to refer to a punishment which is less\h\h

133
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,960
serious than it should have been. So,\h
if some people commit a serious crime,\h\h

134
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,160
but only receive a light punishment, you could\h
say ‘They got away with a slap on the wrist.’

135
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,960
Different countries have different justice\h
systems. In the UK, there are two levels of court:\h\h

136
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,080
magistrates’ court and Crown Court.\h\h

137
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:56,320
Magistrates’ courts deal with things like theft,\h
traffic offenses, minor assault, and so on.\h\h

138
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:04,000
More serious crimes go to Crown Court, where\h
trials are held with a jury of twelve citizens.

139
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,800
There’s much more useful language relating\h
to crime and punishment in the dialogues,\h\h

140
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,360
so we recommend reviewing them at least once,\h\h

141
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,320
and writing down words or\h
phrases you want to remember.

142
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,400
Thanks for watching!

143
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,840
See you next time!
