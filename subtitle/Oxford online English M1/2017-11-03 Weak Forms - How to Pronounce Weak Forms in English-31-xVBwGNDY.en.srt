00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,110
Hi I'm Oli.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,460
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,040
In this lesson you can learn about weak forms
in English.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,099
Weak forms are a really important pronunciation
point.

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:20,430
Learning about weak forms can help your speaking,
of course, but if can also make a big difference

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,880
to your English listening.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,890
Let's see how.

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,419
Listen to a sentence:

9
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:31,480
I gave her a box of chocolates for her birthday.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,390
So, what are weak forms?

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,490
Some words have two possible pronunciations.

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:45,780
For example, think about the word for in this
sentence.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,920
If you just read the word by itself, you’ll
probably say /fɔː/.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,130
However, in the sentence, its pronunciation
is different.

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,480
It becomes /fə/.

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,260
So, the word for has a weak form.

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,970
Its pronunciation changes.

18
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,400
This isn’t just because we’re saying it
very fast.

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,600
It has a different sound: /ə/ instead of
/ɔː/.

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,750
Can you see any other weak forms in our sentence?

21
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,990
Her, a and of are also weak.

22
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,140
Try it!

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,409
Read the sentence.

24
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:29,540
Try to pronounce the weak forms:

25
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,960
I gave /hərə/ box /əv/chocolates /fəhə/
birthday.

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,100
So, do all words have weak forms?

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:45,270
No, there are many words which have weak forms,
but not all words do.

28
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,100
In this lesson, you’ll see which words have
weak forms, when to use them, and how to pronounce

29
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,610
them correctly.

30
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:01,030
Words which have weak forms are often ‘grammar’
words.

31
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,930
Words which carry the main meaning of a sentence
don’t usually have weak forms.

32
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:14,459
That means most nouns, verbs, adjectives and
adverbs don’t have weak forms.

33
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:21,120
Prepositions like to, for, as, of or at have
weak forms.

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,079
Pronouns like you, your, that or there can
have weak forms.

35
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:32,689
Some conjunctions like and or but can also
have weak forms.

36
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:36,920
Also, auxiliary verbs often have weak forms.

37
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,400
That means words like do, does, was, would,
can, are, and so on.

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,409
Lots of information, I know!

39
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:48,430
Let’s do some examples.

40
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,879
Look at a sentence:

41
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,140
Are you coming to the cinema with us tomorrow?

42
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,950
There are five weak forms in this sentence.

43
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,680
Can you find them? Listen one more time.

44
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,580
Are you coming to the cinema with us tomorrow?

45
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,159
Can you hear where the weak forms are?

46
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,999
The weak forms are:

47
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:17,470
Are, which is pronounced /ə/.

48
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,760
You, which becomes /jə/.

49
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,659
To, which is pronounced /tə/.

50
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,439
The.

51
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,329
The is almost always weak, but it is technically
a weak form: /ðə/.

52
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:37,189
Finally, us is weak; it becomes /əs/.

53
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:45,469
So you can see that the weak forms are the
auxiliary verb (are), the pronouns (you, us),

54
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:49,140
and the preposition (to).

55
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:55,329
Also, do you notice anything about the pronunciation
of the weak forms?

56
00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:00,129
In all of the weak forms, you can see this
sound: /ə/.

57
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,719
This sound, the schwa, is common in weak forms.

58
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:06,839
Almost all weak forms have a schwa sound.

59
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:10,439
Let’s do one more example, for practice.

60
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,599
Listen to another sentence:

61
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,389
What does he do at the weekends?

62
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,100
Can you hear the weak forms?

63
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:25,840
If not, can you guess which words are weak
here? Listen one more time.

64
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,980
What does he do at the weekends?

65
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,900
Does is weak.

66
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,070
It’s pronounced /dəz/.

67
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,180
At is also weak.

68
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,430
It becomes /ət/.

69
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,560
The is weak, as before: /ðə/.

70
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:52,300
So, here’s a question: why is does weak
but do is not?

71
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,040
It’s because does is an auxiliary verb.

72
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,330
It’s just there to make a question; it doesn’t
add any meaning to the sentence.

73
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,260
Do is the main verb.

74
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,360
It carries meaning.

75
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,350
Words which carry meaning have their full
pronunciation, and won’t be weak.

76
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:17,840
Again, you can see that all of the weak forms
have the schwa sound: /ə/.

77
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,130
There are many more weak forms, but the number
of words with weak forms is limited.

78
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,850
Depending on how you define ‘weak form’,
there are maybe 30-60 words which have weak

79
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,960
pronunciations.

80
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:38,300
For now, remember the general idea: ‘grammar’
words like prepositions, pronouns and auxiliary

81
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,200
verbs often have weak forms.

82
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,760
Okay, so now you know a bit about weak forms,
but when should you use them?

83
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:56,420
In an English sentence, some words are pronounced
with more stress than others.

84
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,170
Generally, the words which carry the main
meaning are stressed, while ‘grammar’

85
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:07,900
words like prepositions, pronouns and so on
are not stressed.

86
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,950
Words which are not stressed can be weak forms.

87
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,430
For example:

88
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,870
How long have you been waiting here?

89
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,250
Can you hear which words are stressed?

90
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,670
The words how, long and waiting are stressed:

91
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,430
HOW LONG have you been WAITING here?

92
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,070
The unstressed words can be weak.

93
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,140
Have and you have weak forms.

94
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,170
They’re pronounced together.

95
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,830
You say: /əvjə/.

96
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:49,680
Been and here aren’t stressed, but these
words don’t have weak forms, so the pronunciation

97
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,330
stays the same.

98
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,440
Let’s do one more example:

99
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,250
I could have done more if I’d had more time.

100
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:04,700
Which words are stressed here, and which words
do you think are weak?

101
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,680
Listen one more time.

102
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,420
I could have done more if I’d had more time.

103
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:19,420
The stressed words are done, more, had, more
and time.

104
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,590
The weak forms are could and have.

105
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:29,870
Had is also weak in the contraction I’d;
a contraction like I’d is really just a

106
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,560
weak form which is written.

107
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,120
So, could have is pronounced /kədəv/.

108
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,110
The other unstressed words, like if and I,
don’t have weak forms, so their pronunciation

109
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,540
doesn’t change.

110
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:52,360
Okay, so now you know that weak forms are
words with two possible pronunciations, and

111
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,330
you know when to use the weak pronunciation
of a word.

112
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,720
But, if there are two possible pronunciations,
what about the other one?

113
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,490
The opposite of a weak form is a strong form.

114
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,110
You know that weak forms depend on sentence
stress.

115
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,970
However, sentence stress is not fixed.

116
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:23,370
Sentence stress depends on the situation,
and the exact ideas you’re trying to express.

117
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,730
Let’s look at an example we saw before:

118
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,610
How long have you been waiting here?

119
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:38,309
We said that in this sentence, the stressed
words would normally be how, long and waiting.

120
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:43,279
However, imagine you’re talking to several
people.

121
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,460
You ask the question to one person, but a
different person answers.

122
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:54,079
You ask person A, but person B thinks you’re
talking to him, and he answers instead.

123
00:08:54,079 --> 00:09:00,399
So, you ask the question again to person A.
This time, it sounds different:

124
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,290
How long have YOU been waiting here?

125
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,800
Why does it sound different?

126
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,110
And what’s the difference?

127
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:14,310
This time, you’re emphasising the word you,
because you want to make it clear who you’re

128
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,709
talking to.

129
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:23,200
That means that you is pronounced with its
full pronunciation: /jʊː/.

130
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,300
Let’s do one more example.

131
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:28,220
We’ll look at another sentence from before:

132
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,760
Are you coming to the cinema with us tomorrow?

133
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,300
Normally, the stressed words would be coming,
cinema and tomorrow.

134
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,589
However, imagine that you thought your friend
wasn’t coming.

135
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:48,740
Someone had told you that she was busy, and
couldn’t come with you.

136
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,610
So now, when you ask the question, it sounds
different:

137
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,890
ARE you coming to the cinema with us tomorrow?

138
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:04,529
This time, you emphasise the word are, because
you thought your friend couldn’t come, and

139
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,540
you’re showing surprise.

140
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,910
So, if you want to emphasise a word, you should
use the strong form.

141
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,990
Strong forms have the full pronunciation.

142
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:22,389
Emphasis depends on meaning, so the same word
in the same sentence can be pronounced differently

143
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,209
in different situations.

144
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:31,079
There’s one more rule: the last word of
a sentence can never be weak.

145
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:32,079
For example:

146
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,970
What are you looking at?

147
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,350
The stressed words here are what and looking.

148
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:46,740
Are and you are weak; they’re pronounced
/əjə/.

149
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,439
At has a weak form, and it’s not stressed
in this sentence.

150
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:55,819
However, the last word of a sentence can’t
be weak.

151
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:59,920
That means at gets its full pronunciation,
/æt/.

152
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,449
Now, hopefully you understand what weak forms
are, when to use them, and when not to use

153
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:07,499
them.

154
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,780
So, let’s do some practice!

155
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,200
First, look at three sentences:

156
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,540
Think about which words will be stressed,
and which words will be weak forms.

157
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,280
Pause the video and think about it if you
need more time.

158
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,360
Next, I’ll read the sentences.

159
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:34,230
Listen for stressed words and weak forms.

160
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,740
Were your ideas right?

161
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,860
Does she really think she should do it?

162
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,300
What did you do to your hair?

163
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,940
What were you doing when she called you?

164
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,000
Let's look together.

165
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,600
Does she really think she should do it?

166
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,080
Here, really, think and do are stressed.

167
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:01,589
Does and should are weak.

168
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,410
Try saying the sentence with the stress and
weak forms.

169
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,209
Repeat after me:

170
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:14,000
Does she really think she should do it?

171
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,050
Try once more, a little faster:

172
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:24,360
Does she really think she should do it?

173
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,939
How was that?

174
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:29,809
Can you pronounce the weak forms correctly?

175
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:36,499
One important point: weak forms are always
connected to the words before and after.

176
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:42,929
So does needs to be joined to she: /dəsʃi/

177
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:49,470
Should needs to be pronounced together with
she and do: /ʃiʃəd.dʊː/

178
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:54,139
Let’s look at our next sentence:

179
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,680
What did you do to your hair?

180
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:02,019
Here, what, do and hair are stressed.

181
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:07,170
You, to and your are weak.

182
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,430
Try saying the sentence with the stress and
weak forms.

183
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,329
Repeat after me:

184
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:18,780
What did you do to your hair?

185
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,760
Let’s try again, at natural speed:

186
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:28,260
What did you do to your hair?

187
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,410
Okay, let’s look at our last sentence:

188
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,400
What were you doing when she called you?

189
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,660
Here, what, doing and called are stressed.

190
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,559
Were and you are weak.

191
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:52,369
The you on the end is not stressed, but not
weak, either, because it’s the last word

192
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:55,260
of the sentence.

193
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,079
Try saying the sentence with the stress and
weak forms.

194
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,839
Repeat after me:

195
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,420
What were you doing when she called you?

196
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,800
Let’s try again, at natural speed:

197
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,660
What were you doing when she called you?

198
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,220
Remember, if you want more practice, you can
review this section and try as many times

199
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,140
as you need to!

200
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:28,140
Okay, hopefully you've learned something new about weak forms and English pronunciation.
