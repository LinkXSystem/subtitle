00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,900
Hi, I’m Marie.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,180
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,560
In this lesson, you can learn about active
listening.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,480
What’s ‘active listening’?

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,360
You’ll find out in detail in the rest of
this lesson.

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:18,980
You’ll see why listening is not just a passive
skill, and how developing active listening

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,279
skills will improve not only your English
listening, but also your English communication

8
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:26,760
skills more generally.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,079
Before we start, you should take a look at
our website: Oxford Online English dot com.

with your English.

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,880
Oxford Online English dot com.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,560
Now, let’s get back to our topic.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,560
What is ‘active listening?’

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,280
Oh yeah, I meant to tell you: I got a message
from that woman.

20
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:11,610
You know, the one who told me she had met
me before, but in Peru?

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,170
It’s unbelievable, but it turns out I have
an identical twin sister, and we were separated

22
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,940
at birth.

23
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,640
And that’s…

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,440
I mean…

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,360
That’s big news, right?

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,060
Yes.

27
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,900
That’s why you need active listening.

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,540
Listening is often described as a passive
skill.

29
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:36,830
However, when you’re talking to someone,
especially face-to-face, you can’t be completely

30
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,520
passive.

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,010
The listener in a conversation has to take
part.

32
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,369
If you’re listening to someone, you need
to give feedback.

33
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:48,950
You need to show that you’re interested,
or not.

34
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,210
You need to show that you understood, or you
didn’t.

35
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:57,119
If you don’t, it’s difficult for the other
person to continue, and the conversation will

36
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,500
become awkward.

37
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,340
Sometimes, we meet English learners who have
the problem you saw in the dialogue.

38
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,280
They don’t give any feedback.

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,030
It’s difficult to communicate like that.

40
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,300
We understand; it’s because you’re focusing
so much on hearing the words and understanding

41
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,400
the meaning.

42
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,569
You don’t have spare energy for anything
else.

43
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:22,660
Anyway, what is active listening?

44
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,980
Active listening means that you take part
in the conversation even when you’re not

45
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,680
speaking.

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,400
You give feedback, either verbally or non-verbally.

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,480
Active listening is essential, and it will
help your English in many ways.

48
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,420
We’ll give you one important example.

49
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,360
Often, English learners don’t want to show
that they haven’t understood something.

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,090
Often, it’s because they feel embarrassed,
or they don’t want people to judge them

51
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,640
for their English.

52
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,940
If this is your situation, you might stay
silent when people are speaking, and you won’t

53
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,660
ask the other person to speak more slowly,
or repeat points, or explain things again.

54
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,780
This makes communication difficult.

55
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,330
The other person doesn’t know what you have
or haven’t understood.

56
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:12,780
They won’t know what to do to help you understand.

57
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,220
But, if you give the right feedback, communication
will become easier.

58
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,440
You’ll be able to show what you don’t
hear or don’t understand, and the person

59
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,770
you’re talking to will have a chance to
adjust.

60
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,310
That’s just one example.

61
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,940
There are many more; active listening is essential
for clear, comfortable communication.

62
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:41,940
So, what do you need to do to be an active
listener?

63
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,500
Oh hey, I wanted to tell you something about
the cottage for our Wales trip.

64
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,580
Oh yeah?

65
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,030
It turns out that they got the prices wrong,
and the actual cost is much more expensive.

66
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,030
Mm-hmm.

67
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,930
So, we’re going to look for something else.

68
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,349
It’s short notice, but hopefully we can
find something.

69
00:03:58,349 --> 00:03:59,349
OK.

70
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:03,340
If we find something, we’ll have to book
it fast, so check the WhatsApp group.

71
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,340
Uh-huh.

72
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,260
I mean, do you want to check out whatever
we find before we book?

73
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,040
No, if you find something, just go for it.

74
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,760
Right.

75
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,620
One of the most important forms of active
listening is simple.

76
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:22,590
When you’re listening to someone, you use
simple words and sounds to show that you’re

77
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,470
listening and that you understand.

78
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:32,470
Common words and sounds you can use are ‘yeah’,
‘oh yeah’, ‘OK’, ‘mm-hmm’, ‘mmm’,

79
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,460
or ‘uh-huh’.

80
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,190
When you use these in active listening, they’re
pronounced quickly and quietly, without emphasis

81
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,680
or much intonation.

82
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,530
You could also show understanding and interest
with basic body language, for example nodding,

83
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,139
making eye contact, and so on.

84
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:56,160
It’s simple, but it’s important.

85
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,199
When you’re speaking your first language,
you probably do it without thinking.

86
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,880
What about in English?

87
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,460
Think about it: do you listen actively in
this way, or not?

88
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,520
If not, try to focus on it when you’re listening
to someone.

89
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,610
If you don’t give this feedback to the other
person, it will look like either you don’t

90
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,160
understand, or you’re not interested.

91
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,110
This is the most basic point.

92
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,640
What else can you do with active listening?

93
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,740
I got a promotion.

94
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,680
I’m the new head of the regional division.

95
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Wow!

96
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,300
Actually, it’s a crazy story.

97
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,520
You know our manager,
the one that we all hated?

98
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,780
It turns out she’d been stealing from the company for
years.

99
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,270
No way!

100
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,560
We found out when police officers came in
and arrested her right in her office!

101
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Are you serious?

102
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,259
Yeah, and that’s not all.

103
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,270
She went crazy as the police officers were taking her out.

104
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,419
She was screaming, kicking,
trying to bite them…

105
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:56,419
You’re kidding!

106
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:01,539
Anyway, the next day, the head office people
turned up, asked to speak to me and offered

107
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:02,539
me the position.

108
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:03,539
Really?

109
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,480
That’s great news!

110
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,420
Congratulations!

111
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,840
Thanks!

112
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,640
To be an active listener, you’ll sometimes
need to react emotionally to what you’re

113
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,640
hearing.

114
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,480
If someone gives you some bad news, you probably
shouldn’t just react with ‘mm-hmm’ or

115
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
‘uh-huh’.

116
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,180
It could make you sound cold.

117
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,430
To listen actively and show emotion, you can
use words and phrases like ‘really?’ or

118
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,139
‘wow!’

119
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,200
Look at four different situations.

120
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,300
Can you think of words or phrases that you
could use for each situation?

121
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,470
And, how could you pronounce them?

122
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,500
Pause the video if you want to think about
it by yourself.

123
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:52,520
To react to good news, you might say ‘that’s
great!’, ‘wow!’ or ‘amazing!’

124
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,380
To react to bad news, you might say ‘oh
no!’, ‘that’s too bad’ or ‘what

125
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,680
a shame.’

126
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,630
To show surprise, you might say ‘really?’,
‘no way!’ or ‘are you serious?’

127
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,900
To show frustration, you might say ‘oh come
on’, ‘you can’t be serious’ or ‘no

128
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,740
way!’

129
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,000
Of course, there are other possible answers.

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,440
Here, you need to think about pronunciation,
too, specifically intonation.

131
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,260
You saw that you could use the phrase ‘no
way!’ to express surprise or frustration.

132
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,380
But, the intonation is different.

133
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,110
To show surprise, you’d say it like this:
‘no way!’

134
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:43,100
To show frustration, you’d say it like this:
‘no way!’

135
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,650
This is true for many words and phrases.

136
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,620
For example, you could say ‘really?’

137
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,440
‘really?’

138
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,560
'really?'

139
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,680
Again, think about whether you do this in
English already.

140
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:06,419
Do you use words and phrases like these to
react when you’re listening to someone?

141
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,530
Think about it!

142
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:17,130
Another question: do people do something similar
when they’re speaking in your language?

143
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,669
This is important.

144
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:21,680
Some cultures and languages do this differently.

145
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,169
It might be normal in your language to show
little reaction or emotion when listening.

146
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:32,220
But, in English, you might appear cold or
uninterested to the person you’re speaking

147
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,700
to.

148
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:38,449
If you don’t do this in your language, you’ll
need to focus on it more when you’re having

149
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:41,300
a conversation in English.

150
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:48,740
Next, let’s look at one more important part
of active listening.

151
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,040
Hey, Dave!

152
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,290
Happy birthday!

153
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,679
Are we going for tacos later?

154
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,679
Wha...?

155
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,360
I heard we were going out for tacos, right…?

156
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:56,860
Uh...

157
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,080
I don’t…

158
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,980
I’m not Dave.

159
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,900
Huh?

160
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,240
But…

161
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,640
Who are you, then?

162
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,760
I’m Oli!

163
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,680
Aah…

164
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,740
I thought you were Dave.

165
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,740
That’s embarrassing.

166
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,249
Dave’s over there
What?

167
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,820
What? *He’s* Dave?

168
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,160
I’ve been calling him Gareth for months.

169
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,320
Gareth?

170
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,100
Who’s Gareth?

171
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:25,519
If you don’t understand something in a conversation,
it’s generally better to show this immediately.

172
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,949
If you show the other person that something
isn’t clear, you can deal with the problem

173
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:31,730
right away.

174
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,350
If you don’t, it’s more difficult—and
more uncomfortable—to go back to something

175
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,410
which was said one minute, or two minutes,
or ten minutes ago.

176
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,629
To show that you don’t understand, use a
word or sound like ‘what?’

177
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:48,819
‘wha?’, ‘uh?’ or ‘huh?’

178
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:52,050
As before, intonation is important.

179
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,949
A sound like ‘huh’ can also be used to
show understanding or surprise.

180
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:03,980
To show that you don’t understand, it should
have a high, rising intonation: huh?

181
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,059
Often, showing that you don’t understand
is enough.

182
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:12,590
The person you’re talking to will see that
something is not clear, and try to help, by

183
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,980
explaining or repeating what they said.

184
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,200
However, you might need to do more.

185
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,149
The question is: why didn’t you understand
something?

186
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:25,239
Did you not hear?

187
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:27,639
Did you not understand the words?

188
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:30,350
Did you not understand the situation?

189
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,910
Was it something else?

190
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:38,279
You can give the other person more feedback
by explaining or asking a question.

191
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,520
For example, you could say ‘I didn’t catch
what you said.’

192
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,640
‘I don’t get what you mean.’

193
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,900
‘I have no idea what you’re talking about.’

194
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,560
Of course, this depends heavily on the situation.

195
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:59,689
But, if the other person doesn’t know what
you do or don’t understand, it’s difficult

196
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:01,189
to communicate.

197
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:05,189
If you make it clear where the problem is,
you have a chance to solve it.

198
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:11,379
There’s one more point about active listening:
non-verbal communication is also important.

199
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:16,929
Facial expressions can show that you’re
interested, or bored, or confused, or surprised,

200
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:18,059
and so on.

201
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,220
Also, gestures, like shrugging
or holding out a hand with the palm facing

202
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,250
up—or down
—can be part of active listening.

203
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,730
Again, think about how this is in your language
and your culture.

204
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,980
You might use facial expressions and gestures
more, or less, or differently than English

205
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,610
speakers.

206
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:44,399
When speaking English, you might want to adjust
your non-verbal communication as well.

207
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,110
Let us know in the comments: are these ideas
similar in your language, or not?

208
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,279
How are they different?

209
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,769
Tell us, because we’re curious!

210
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:58,750
Also, try to use the ideas in this video when
you’re speaking and listening.

211
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,249
You can even practise when watching a YouTube
video, or listening to a podcast, or things

212
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:05,149
like that.

213
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:10,290
Active listening is a useful habit, but like
all habits, you need to practise it if you

214
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,459
want to use it naturally and comfortably.

215
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:14,819
Thanks for watching!

216
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:15,610
See you next time!
