00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,950
Hi, I’m Stephanie.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,600
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,390
In this lesson, you can learn how to improve
your reading skills in English.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,660
We’ll show you the number one mistake English
learners make when they try to practice their

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,730
reading in English, and how to avoid it.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,570
You’ll see a step-by-step plan that you
can use to improve your English reading skills,

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,070
and we’ll give you several suggestions to
improve your English reading level more quickly

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,050
and efficiently.

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,210
You heard just now that there’s one big
mistake that many English learners make when

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,070
trying to practice reading.

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:43,840
So, what is it, and how can you avoid it?

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,760
Here’s a situation.

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,909
Think about whether you’ve been here before.

14
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:50,850
You start reading something in English.

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,149
You can’t understand a lot of it, and there
are many unknown words.

16
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:59,979
You start looking up every word you don’t
know in a dictionary.

17
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:04,510
Thirty minutes later, you’re either asleep,
or you’ve read about two paragraphs.

18
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:10,680
Of course, this makes you feel bad, and you
start feeling that you can’t read in English,

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,210
that it’s too difficult, and so on.

20
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,610
But, this isn’t true!

21
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,500
You can read in English and you can improve,
whatever your English level now.

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,590
What’s the key?

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,680
You need to select materials at the right
level.

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,660
Often, people try to read the same things
they would read in their native language.

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:36,080
But, if your English level is intermediate,
like many of the learners we meet, then you

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,180
need to accept that you can’t read all the
same things in English that you would read

27
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,560
in your own language.

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,130
If you try, you’ll probably feel frustrated, and
maybe give up.

29
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,410
So, it’s essential to select reading materials
that are the right level for your English

30
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,710
abilities now.

31
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,890
But, how can you do that?

32
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,120
Here are some tests you can use:

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,520
One: can you understand the general meaning
of the text without using a dictionary?

34
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,020
Two: can you understand the general meaning
of most sentences without using a dictionary?

35
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,920
Three: can you read the text at a reasonable
speed?

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,310
This is subjective, but it shouldn’t take
an hour to read a few paragraphs.

37
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:27,409
If you can’t answer ‘yes’ to these questions,
then the text is probably too hard.

38
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:31,629
Of course, you don’t want it to be too easy,
either!

39
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:36,540
If you can understand everything first time,
it’s probably too easy.

40
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,620
There should be some words and ideas which
aren’t easy to understand.

41
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,519
You’re probably thinking: so where can I
find suitable reading materials?

42
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,650
That’s a hard question to answer, because
this depends on your level, your study goals,

43
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,430
and your personal tastes.

44
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,020
Here’s one suggestion: look for Graded readers.

45
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,610
Graded readers are books adapted specially
for English learners.

46
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,329
They take famous stories, or even things like
Shakespeare plays, and adapt them for different

47
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:09,599
levels.

48
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,569
Naturally, there are many other sources of
English reading materials: news websites,

49
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:20,650
magazines, blogs, forums, books, journals,
and so on.

50
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,439
However, whatever you read, it should pass
these tests.

51
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,180
You should be able to read and understand
most of the general ideas without using a

52
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,629
dictionary or spending hours reading a short
text.

53
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:38,980
If you can get this right, then you’ve done
the most important work.

54
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,440
Remember that you don’t have to finish reading
everything you start.

55
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,790
For this lesson, we’re talking about reading
in order to improve your English level.

56
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,380
To do this, you need to find the right materials
at the right level.

57
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,620
Don’t waste your time trying to read things
which are much too difficult.

58
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,460
So, what’s the next step?

59
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:07,020
Let’s get one thing clear: improving your
reading skills in English is going to take

60
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:08,090
a lot of time.

61
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,519
It’s not something you can do in days or
weeks.

62
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,450
There aren’t any tricks which can help you
to improve faster.

63
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,769
So, the best thing you can do is very simple:
read as much as possible.

64
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,560
Spend as much time reading in English as you
can.

65
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,900
Also, variety is important in your reading
practice.

66
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,250
If you read the same kind of texts again and
again, you’ll get good at reading that kind

67
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,800
of text.

68
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,490
For example, if you only ever read news articles
about economics, you’ll get very good at

69
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:49,030
reading news articles about economics, but
you might find it difficult to read other

70
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,320
styles of text on other topics.

71
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,440
If you’ve seen our video about how to improve
your listening, then you might recognise these

72
00:04:58,449 --> 00:04:59,449
ideas.

73
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:06,460
That’s because improving your reading and
improving your listening need a similar approach.

74
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:12,660
Let’s make an example reading study plan
together, but first, we want you to think

75
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,100
about something: how many different things
could you read in English?

76
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,720
Pause the video, and try to think of five
different things you could read.

77
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,940
Make them as different as possible.

78
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,200
Ready?

79
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,220
Let’s make a reading study plan together.

80
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,539
There are two rules:

81
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:35,539
1.

82
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:37,520
Do something every day.

83
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,080
If you’re very busy, try to do five minutes
a day.

84
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,540
Five minutes is better than nothing.

85
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,669
If you can do ten minutes a day, do ten minutes.

86
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:48,819
If you can do more, do more.

87
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:53,050
But, do something, even if it’s just a little
bit!

88
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,259
2.

89
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:56,520
Do something different every day.

90
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,259
If you read part of a novel one day, read
something different the next day.

91
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:08,169
Also, try to find things you’re interested
in, and that you really want to read.

92
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:13,370
That way, it won’t feel so much like studying,
which will make it easier to do regularly.

93
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,100
Anyway, here’s a possible plan for one week:

94
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:27,580
Monday: read 1-2 pages of a short story
Tuesday: read a blog post

95
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:35,100
Wednesday: read a BBC news article
Thursday: do a reading exercise from an English

96
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,900
textbook
Friday: read a film review online

97
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,920
Saturday: read the comments on an online news
article

98
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,000
Sunday: read the lyrics to a song

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,880
Of course, you should make your own plan to
suit your own interests and level.

100
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,430
When you’ve made your plan, write it down
and stick it on a wall, or on your bathroom

101
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,430
mirror, or somewhere where you’ll see it
every day.

102
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,879
When you finish each thing, cross it off
your plan.

103
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:15,629
That way, you can track what you’ve done,
and feel good about finishing your plan.

104
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:20,789
On the one hand, it’s good to challenge
yourself, so give yourself one or two harder

105
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:25,729
days, where you’re reading more, or reading
something more difficult.

106
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:30,540
On the other hand, be realistic and don’t
try to do too much.

107
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:36,460
It’s more important to make reading in English
a long-term habit, so make a plan which you

108
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,830
can stick to regularly!

109
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,830
Next, keep doing this, every day, every week,
every month.

110
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:49,460
You might not feel that you’re getting better,
but over time, you will improve.

111
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:55,009
Now, you’ve seen the most important ideas
you need to improve your English reading.

112
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:57,760
There are a couple more points to think about.

113
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,660
Let’s look.

114
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:07,440
Here’s a situation: you’re taking an English
exam, maybe an IELTS exam.

115
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:10,969
You have a reading text which is difficult
for you.

116
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:16,629
There are many words you haven’t seen before,
and many sentences which you don’t understand

117
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,370
clearly.

118
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,090
The clock is ticking.

119
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,639
What can you do?

120
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,199
Are there any tricks to make it easier to
understand the text in this situation?

121
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,520
Surely there must be some special techniques
which make it easier, right?

122
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,880
Not really.

123
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:38,339
If you’re reading a text and you don’t
know many of the words, that’s a bad situation.

124
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,650
If your grammar knowledge isn’t enough to
understand complex sentence structures, then

125
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,600
that’s a bad situation.

126
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,940
At that moment, when you’re in your exam
and you’re faced with this difficult text,

127
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,480
there’s really no good solution.

128
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,920
There are many videos and lessons giving you
‘reading tips and tricks’, including some

129
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,200
of our own!

130
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,279
However, these are only necessary if your
reading level isn’t high enough for a specific

131
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,040
task, like an IELTS reading exam.

132
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,139
These tips and tricks are ways to deal with
having a lower reading level than you need.

133
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:16,110
Like everything in this lesson, there’s
no quick fix here.

134
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,220
To improve your English reading level, you
also need to improve your vocabulary and grammar

135
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,320
knowledge, and that’s a long, slow process.

136
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,680
But, it’s necessary.

137
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,420
Remember in part one, we said that you should
choose reading materials which you could understand

138
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,200
most of without a dictionary?

139
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,220
Now, we need to look at this from the other
side.

140
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,300
Often in life, you can’t choose the things
you need to read.

141
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,850
If you’re at work, or taking an English
exam, you’ll be given a text.

142
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,720
You can’t choose to read something easier.

143
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,520
In that situation, you need to know most of
the words in the text already.

144
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:59,580
If you don’t, it will take you a long time
and a lot of work to read and understand the

145
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,269
text, and there’s a high chance that you’ll
misunderstand parts of it.

146
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:06,250
So, what should you do?

147
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,920
Firstly, your reading practice needs to be
supported by regular grammar and vocabulary

148
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,040
work.

149
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,070
We won’t go into details about this here,
because it’s too big as a topic, but if

150
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:23,449
you need advice, there are many free materials
and videos on our channel and our website

151
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:27,400
to help you learn vocabulary and grammar effectively.

152
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,980
Secondly, when you read something in English,
don’t just read it once.

153
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:39,000
Read it two, three, four or more times, especially
if it’s difficult to understand the first

154
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,510
time.

155
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:45,339
Vocabulary learning depends on repetition,
so by reading a text many times, you give

156
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:51,560
yourself more chances to see new words and
phrases in context, which makes it easier

157
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,620
to remember them.

158
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:59,399
Thirdly, as you practice and as your reading
level improves, increase the difficulty of

159
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,500
your reading materials.

160
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:07,460
This way, you’ll continuously see new words,
new phrases, new sentence structures, and

161
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,900
so on.

162
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:17,080
Okay, let’s look at one more useful point
you can use to practice your English reading.

163
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,959
Okay, you’re probably
bored of hearing that improving your English

164
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:22,060
reading is a long, slow, pro…

165
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,500
Okay, okay, you get it.

166
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,070
We’ve told you many times.

167
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,160
The problem with long, slow processes is that
they’re often boring.

168
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,930
And, when something’s boring, it can be
hard to motivate yourself to do it.

169
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,140
So, how can you deal with this?

170
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:43,250
The most important point is something you’ve
already heard: read things you’re interested

171
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,250
in.

172
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,769
However, there are a few other things you
can do.

173
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:52,269
One idea is to set yourself challenges.

174
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:57,570
For example, use a timer when reading something
and set yourself a time limit.

175
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,640
Try to read the whole text within that time.

176
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,900
Or, get a speed reading app.

177
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:09,340
There are many available in the Apple Store
or Play Store, including many free apps.

178
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:15,470
These apps display text at a specific speed,
so you have to read at the same speed.

179
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:20,670
As you get better, you can challenge yourself
by increasing the speed.

180
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:25,360
Another good challenge is to read texts without
a dictionary or any help.

181
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,410
You shouldn’t do this all the time, because
it’s useful to learn new vocabulary when

182
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,430
you read, and you need a dictionary for this.

183
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,060
However, sometimes it’s good to practice
without any help.

184
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,570
It’s also useful because this is often closer
to real-life situations, where you might be

185
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,829
under pressure and unable to look up every
word you don’t know.

186
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:49,940
Follow these tips and your English reading
level will improve.

187
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,180
Remember that you need to be patient!

188
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,080
Do you have any good tips to help others improve
their English reading level?

00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,750
