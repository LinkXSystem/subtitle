00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,220
Hi, I’m Oli.

You’ll learn how to use prepositions, conjunctions
and other useful words and phrases to talk

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,590
about time.

6

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:45,190
The things you’ll learn in this lesson will
help you in many situations: telling stories,

11
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:51,050
saying when things happen, talking about the
future, describing how long something lasted,

12
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,239
and many more.

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:59,960
Let’s start with one of the most basic ways
to talk about time.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,360
When’s her birthday?

15
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,460
How many times have you asked me that?

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,660
It’s in December.

17
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,400
Are you sure?

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,920
I thought it was in January.

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,140
No, it’s definitely in December, on the
23rd.

20
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,939
But that can’t be right.

21
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:17,360
Her birthday was on a Saturday last year,
and this year the 23rd is a Wednesday.

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,810
You’re thinking of her birthday *party.*
She had it on the weekend before her birthday.

23
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,700
Don’t you remember?

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,650
Our car broke down and we got there at eleven.

25
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,650
Oh yeah!

26
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,970
And then we had to stay the night there because
we couldn’t drive back.

27
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:32,970
That’s right!

28
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,110
Then, in the morning, remember that we had
to try to call a tow truck, and we couldn’t

29
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,119
find anyone who was working?

30
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:41,119
Of course!

31
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,119
What a nightmare!

32
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,860
What time did we get home in the end?

33
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,860
Five?

34
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,860
Six?

35
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,479
It was in the evening, but not too late.

36
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,149
Maybe at six, yeah.

37
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,899
Was that the second time we went?

38
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,899
No, we’ve been three times.

39
00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:05,610
The first was in 2015, we were away in 2016,
and then we went in 2017 and 2018.

40
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,950
So, if we go this year, it’ll be the fourth
time.

41
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,180
Has she invited us?

42
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,470
Yeah, she’s having her party on the Friday
before her birthday.

43
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,200
So, on the 18th?

44
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,030
That’s right.

45
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,690
In the dialogue, you heard many examples of
using ‘at’, ‘on’ and ‘in’ to talk

46
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,140
about when things are.

47
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,390
Can you remember any?

48
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:35,440
Do you know any rules about using ‘at’,
‘on’ and ‘in’ to talk about time?

49
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,170
Use ‘in’ for months and years.

50
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:50,010
For example: ‘in December’, ‘in January’,
‘in 2016’ or ‘in 1999.’

51
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:56,400
You can also use ‘in’ for parts of the
day: ‘in the morning,’ ‘in the afternoon’,

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,010
or ‘in the evening’.

53
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,980
Use ‘on’ with days and dates.

54
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:11,770
For example: ‘on Saturday’, ‘on Friday’,
‘on the 3rd’, or ‘on the 20th of November’.

55
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,730
Use ‘at’ with times.

56
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:22,990
For example: ‘at six o’clock’, ‘at
five thirty’, or ‘at twelve forty-five’.

57
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,270
There are a few exceptions and flexible cases.

58
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:31,980
In British English, you say: ‘at the weekend’
and ‘at Christmas’, but in American English,

59
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,740
you say ‘on the weekend’ and ‘on Christmas’.

60
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:41,040
Also, although you say ‘in the morning’,
‘in the afternoon’ and ‘in the evening’,

61
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,280
you also say ‘at night’.

62
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,230
It’s an exception.

63
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,870
Let’s practice quickly!

64
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,260
We’re going to ask you four questions.

65
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,760
After each question, pause the video and answer
with a full sentence.

66
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,010
Ready?

67
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,750
When’s your birthday?

68
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,080
What time did you get up this morning?

69
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,540
When’s the last time you went on vacation?

70
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,960
When’s your next day off?

71
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,740
How was that?

72
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,130
Could you answer all the questions?

73
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:22,660
Of course, there are many possible answers,
but here are some suggestions.

74
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:28,480
You could say, ‘My birthday’s on the eighth
of June.’

75
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,330
You could say, ‘I got up at half past seven.'

76
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:40,310
You could say, ‘The last time I went on
vacation was in May.’

77
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,460
You could say, ‘My next day off is on Saturday.’

78
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,560
Could you answer all the questions?

79
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,880
Remember that you can go back and review this
section if you need to!

80
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,690
Let’s move on to our next point.

81
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,340
I can’t work like this!

82
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,730
This is ridiculous!

83
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,240
What’s the problem now?

84
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,110
The network’s not working again.

85
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,400
I’ve spent the whole morning dealing with
this.

86
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,360
I can’t even log in.

87
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,450
How’m I supposed to work?

88
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,770
Have you called the IT department?

89
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,250
Of course!

90
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,730
They’re useless!

91
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,900
They told me it’d be fixed in an hour, but
it wasn’t.

92
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:29,180
I called again and they promised that it’d
be done by midday at the latest, but now it’s

93
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,090
nearly two and so far nothing seems to have
happened.

94
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,420
Well, I’m sure it’ll be fixed in the next
few hours.

95
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,160
Can’t you do some other work in the meantime?

96
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,290
I need the image files, which are in a shared
folder.

97
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,500
I promised my client this would be done by
the end of today.

98
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,340
Now I’m going to look bad because we can’t
make our computer systems work.

99
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,410
You should take this more seriously, you know.

100
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,120
I am taking it seriously, but we don’t have
these problems all the time.

101
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,760
Until recently, everything worked pretty well,
right?

102
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,280
I wouldn’t say that.

103
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,680
We’ve had at least five days this month
when things weren’t available for an hour

104
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,390
or more.

105
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,780
In the long run, that lost time adds up.

106
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:21,350
I agree; it’s not ideal, but look: in the
short term, there’s not much I can do.

107
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,770
I’ll talk to the IT department and try to
move things along.

108
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,850
I can also call your client to explain the
situation and apologise, if you like.

109
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,960
How does that sound?

110
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,139
Sounds good.

111
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,600
OK, so we’ll talk in an hour and I’ll
give you an update.

112
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,320
Sure.

113
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,300
In this section, you’re going to learn how
to use the prepositions ‘in’, ‘by’,

114
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,960
and ‘until’.

115
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,520
In this dialogue, you saw a different way
to use ‘in’.

116
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,570
Do you remember what you heard?

117
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:57,940
You heard: ‘They told me it’d be fixed
in an hour’, and ‘We’ll talk in an hour.’

118
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,990
What does ‘in’ mean here?

119
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:07,830
You can use ‘in’ plus a time period to
say when something will happen.

120
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:14,760
It’s most often used to talk about the future,
although you might use it in the past if you’re

121
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,620
talking about what someone said.

122
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,400
For example, ‘We’ll arrive in three days.’

123
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,150
This means that we’ll arrive three days
from now.

124
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,980
If today is Tuesday, I mean we’ll arrive
on Friday.

125
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:37,390
Here’s another example: ‘Your car will
be ready in 30 minutes.’

126
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:43,880
That means, if it’s one o’clock now, your
car will be ready at one-thirty.

127
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,620
There are also phrases with ‘in’, like
‘in the short term’, or ‘in the long

128
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,620
run’.

129
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,120
‘In the short term’ means you’re talking
about the near future.

130
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,550
‘In the long run’ has the opposite meaning:
you’re talking about the distant future.

131
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:04,490
For example: ‘In the short term, he needs
to focus on getting out of debt.’

132
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,560
This means that in the near future, paying
off his debt should be his priority.

133
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,540
Next, let’s think about ‘by’ and ‘until’.

134
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,240
Do you know the difference between these two
prepositions?

135
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,980
Look at two sentences: ‘She’ll be here
by Friday.’

136
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,000
‘She’ll be here until Friday’.

137
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,210
What’s the difference?

138
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:35,729
‘By Friday’ means ‘any time before Friday’.

139
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:43,539
If you say, ‘She’ll be here by Friday’,
you mean that she’s not here now, and she’ll

140
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,900
arrive some time between now and Friday.

141
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:53,500
You don’t know exactly when she’ll arrive,
but you’re sure that she won’t arrive

142
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,620
later than Friday.

143
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:02,020
‘Until Friday’ means ‘continuously from
now up to Friday’.

144
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:08,250
If you say, ‘She’ll be here until Friday’,
you mean that she’s here now, but she’ll

145
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,880
leave on Friday.

146
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,020
So, the two sentences have very different
meanings.

147
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:22,360
Does your language have different words for
‘by’ and ‘until’ with these meanings?

148
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,780
Some languages use one preposition for both
meanings; if this is the case in your language,

149
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,110
you’ll need to be careful using ‘by’
and ‘until’ in English!

150
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,820
Let’s do a quick test.

151
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,010
Look at four sentences.

152
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,800
Pause the video if you need more thinking
time.

153
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,700
Ready?

154
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,000
Let’s look at the answers.

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,900
Did you get them all right?

156
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,779
If so, well done!

157
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:56,910
If not, remember that you can review each
section as many times as you need to.

158
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,300
What’s next?

159
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,420
Where’s Georgia?

160
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,920
Weren’t you meeting her at the airport?

161
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,930
Uhh…

162
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,240
It’s a nightmare!

163
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Uh-oh!

164
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
What happened?

165
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,370
I was waiting for her in the arrivals hall,
but I needed the toilet.

166
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,460
I guess while I was in there, she came out,
didn’t see me and went outside.

167
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,200
These things happen.

168
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,260
Anyway, I went back and waited for a while.

169
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:28,740
Then, I realised that she must have arrived
already, so I went outside to look for her.

170
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,550
You won’t believe it: as I was going down
in the elevator, she was going up in the elevator

171
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,800
on the other side, trying to find me.

172
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,980
How do you know?

173
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,320
She called me later; we’ll get to that.

174
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,160
So, I looked around for her near the train
station, but I couldn’t see her.

175
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,810
Just as I was going to go back to arrivals,
she called me.

176
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,810
And?

177
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,610
The signal was really bad, so I couldn’t
really hear her.

178
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:01,990
I ran outside to get a better signal, and
at the exact moment I got out of the doors,

179
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,130
my battery died.

180
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,750
That’s bad luck!

181
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:10,750
So I went back up to arrivals, but it turns
out she was going down at the same time, so

182
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,130
we missed each other again.

183
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,020
It’s like a comedy film!

184
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,250
I wasn’t laughing at the time.

185
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,880
I figured that she’d catch the train into
the city, so I decided to just go to her hotel

186
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,350
and wait for her there.

187
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,010
So did you meet her?

188
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,520
No, but I did find somewhere to charge my
phone, so I called her.

189
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,580
She was still at the airport.

190
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,700
And where is she now?

191
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,660
She said she’d take the train into the centre,
so she’ll call me as soon as she arrives.

192
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,890
I hope she doesn’t fall asleep during the
journey and miss her stop…

193
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,760
Don’t even joke about it!

194
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,700
Look at two sentences you heard in the dialogue.

195
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:55,480
Here’s a question: what’s the difference
between ‘during’ and ‘while’?

196
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,060
Both words are used to say *when* something
happened.

197
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:06,830
Specifically, you use them to talk about two
things which happened at the same time, or

198
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,410
something that happened in the middle of something
else.

199
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:14,300
However, they’re used in different ways.

200
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,750
After ‘during’, use a noun.

201
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:26,480
For example, ‘My phone rang during the film’;
‘During my presentation, there was a power

202
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,589
cut’;
‘I met my husband during my trip to Corsica.’

203
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:40,440
After ‘while’, use a clause; that means
you use a subject and a verb.

204
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,660
For example, ‘I wasn’t paying attention
while he was explaining what to do’;

205
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,460
‘While I’m out, can you tidy up the living
room?'

206
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:57,339
‘I like listening to music while I’m working.’

207
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:03,810
You can also use ‘at’ to talk about things
which happened at the same time.

208
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:11,740
For example: ‘At the exact moment I got
out of the doors, my battery died;’

209
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:20,080
‘I went back up to arrivals, but it turns
out she was going down at the same time.’

210
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:26,970
You could use these in different ways; for
example, ‘At the exact moment the train

211
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:32,340
left, I saw her running into the station’.

212
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:39,020
‘You can’t study and watch TV at the same
time.’

213
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:45,080
Finally, you can use ‘as’ to talk about
the moment when something happened.

214
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,500
In the dialogue, you heard these.

215
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,420
‘As’ means ‘at the moment when’.

216
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,880
So, the first sentence means that at the moment
when I was going down in the elevator, she

217
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,200
was going up in the other elevator.

218
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,370
‘Just as’ has the same meaning, but it’s
more emphatic.

219
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:13,360
Use ‘just as’ to mean that two things
happened at *exactly* the same time.

220
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,860
‘As soon as’ also has the same meaning,
but it’s used to talk about the future.

221
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:24,250
You use it to say that two things *will* happen
at the same time.

222
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:31,800
You can make more examples with this language,
like this: ‘As I was walking down the street,

223
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:38,899
I heard thunder in the distance’;
‘I got to the airport just as they closed

224
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:46,029
the gate for my flight’;
‘We’ll leave as soon as you’re ready.'

225
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:55,700
So, in this section, you saw how to use ‘during’,
‘while’, ‘at’ and ‘as’ to talk

226
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,270
about things which happen at the same time.

227
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:07,970
Note that ‘during’ and ‘at’ are prepositions
here, whereas ‘while’ and ‘as’ are

228
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,760
conjunctions.

229
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,260
Let’s look at one more thing.

230
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,000
Can we stop for something to eat?

231
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,970
I didn’t have lunch and I’m starving!

232
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,420
I’ve been waiting for you for ages!

233
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,950
We’re already going to be late.

234
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,920
I think we should go straight there.

235
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,680
Come on, it won’t take long.

236
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,520
You always say that, and then you take forever.

237
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,900
That’s not fair!

238
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,570
Well, hey, you should’ve been on time.

239
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,540
It’s not my fault you’re always late…

240
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,180
I’m really punctual these days.

241
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,700
This is the first time I’ve been late for
a while.

242
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,980
Are you serious?

243
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,910
Every time I met you over the summer, you
were at least half an hour late.

244
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,760
Yes, but since then, I’ve been mostly on
time, right?

245
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,700
You’ve been less late.

246
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,710
During the last few weeks, I’ve really been
trying to be on time.

247
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:01,870
I know it’s a bad habit to turn up late
everywhere, but it’s a tough habit to break…

248
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,680
Anyway, I don’t want to be even later than
we already are.

249
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,040
Everyone will be wondering what’s happened.

250
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,230
Let’s just go, and you can get some food
there.

251
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,810
But I haven’t eaten anything since this
morning!

252
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,480
Just stop at a shop and let me buy a snack
or something.

253
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,860
It’ll take less than five minutes, I promise.

254
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,140
Oh, alright.

255
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:27,030
If you want to describe how long something
continued, what can you use?

256
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:32,540
Can you remember any of the examples you heard
in the dialogue?

257
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,770
Often, to describe a period of time, you use
the preposition ‘for’.

258
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:42,839
For example, ‘I’ve been waiting for you
for ages’.

259
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:50,810
You can use this in many different ways in
the past, present and future; for example,

260
00:16:50,810 --> 00:17:00,500
‘I’ve worked here for 10 years’;
‘I’ll be staying here for six weeks’;

261
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,470
‘She lived in Paris for several months.’

262
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:15,039
There are also many common phrases with ‘for’,
like ‘for ages’ or ‘for a while’.

263
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,919
‘For ages’ means for a long time; ‘for
a while’ means for some time.

264
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:27,789
‘A while’ means a time period which is
not very short and not very long.

265
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:33,980
It’s not very specific, but it’s useful
and common in spoken English.

266
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:42,149
Here’s a question: can you complete the
missing verb in this sentence?

267
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:44,280
The missing verb is ‘take’.

268
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,129
You can use ‘take’ to say how long something
will continue.

269
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:52,289
In the dialogue, you also heard, ‘It won’t
take long’;

270
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:57,480
‘It’ll take less than five minutes, I
promise.’

271
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,679
You can use ‘take’ in many different situations.

272
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:04,470
For example, ‘How long does it take you
to get to work?’;

273
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:10,820
‘Getting to the airport takes about 45 minutes
if the traffic’s not too bad.’

274
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:17,530
If you want to talk about something which
happened within a longer period of time, you can use

275
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,340
‘over’.

276
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:25,730
In the dialogue, you heard, ‘Every time
I met you over the summer, you were at least

277
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:32,320
half an hour late’;
‘Over the last few weeks, I’ve been really

278
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,030
trying to be on time.’

279
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:43,980
‘Over’ has a similar meaning to ‘during’,
but it’s more conversational, and you use

280
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,100
it only with longer time periods.

281
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,660
You might also see the phrase ‘over time’,
which means ‘gradually.’

282
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:58,190
For example, ‘Over time, cars are getting
more efficient, and therefore cheaper to run.’

283
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:03,700
This is a big topic, and there’s a lot we
weren’t able to fit into this video!

284
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:09,309
Are there other time prepositions or phrases
you’d like to know more about?

285
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:12,129
Please leave your suggestions in the comments!

286
00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:13,879
Thanks for watching!

287
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:14,629
See you next time!
