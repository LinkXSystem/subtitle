00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,110
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,350
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,360
In this lesson, you can learn about the IELTS
speaking exam, part two.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,670
The IELTS speaking test has three parts, and
in this class, you can learn in more detail

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,960
about part two of the speaking exam, and how
to improve your score.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,150
First, let’s review what happens in part
two of the IELTS speaking test.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,180
The examiner will give you a card with a topic.

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,770
You have one minute to prepare a short speech
on the topic.

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,329
After one minute, the examiner will ask you
to speak.

10
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,329
You need to talk for between one and two minutes.

11
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:46,420
After you finish, the examiner will ask you
one or two simple questions about what you

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,420
said.

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,679
Let’s look at a sample question from part
two of the IELTS speaking test which we’ll

14
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,730
use during this lesson:

15
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,019
Describe an important choice you made.

16
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:07,020
You should say:what choices you had, what
you decided, and how easy it was to make your

17
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,020
decision.

18
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,719
You should also explain how you feel about
this choice now.

19
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:15,280
Imagine: you’re in the exam.

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,320
You have one minute to prepare your answer.

21
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,100
How should you use your time?

22
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,100
Let's look!

23
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,360
Part one: how to use your preparation time.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,170
The first thing you should do: ask the examiner
if there are any words you don’t understand!

25
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,760
Asking the examiner will use some of your
time, and that’s not great.

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,080
But, don't talk if you haven’t understood
the question; that will be worse.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,590
Secondly, look at the question.

28
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:49,829
It has four parts: the three bullet points,
and the longer question at the end.

29
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,640
One minute is not a long time.

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,229
You can’t prepare everything, so don’t
try.

31
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,600
Try to think of one or two things you can
say for each part of the question.

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,560
Make short notes to help you remember your
points.

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,320
How can you make effective notes?

34
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,490
Let’s look:

35
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:12,130
For example, let’s say you want to talk
about choosing what to study at university.

36
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,040
You write:

37
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,100
"Computer science or engineering."

38
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,629
"IT—interesting career opportunities."

39
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:23,909
"Difficult—pros and cons on both sides."

40
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:29,630
"Satisfied—IT work is interesting/creative."

41
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,500
These notes will help you to speak.

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,360
Let’s see how:

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,780
The four parts of the notes follow the four
parts of the question.

44
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,180
This will help you to keep your answer organized.

45
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:47,659
You have some key words and phrases like 'career
opportunities', 'pros and cons' or 'creative'

46
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:50,810
which you can use in your answer.

47
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:57,230
The notes give you at least one or two points
to make about each part of the question.

48
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,970
Again, you won’t have time to do more than
this, so don’t try.

49
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:07,459
Don’t write full sentences—focus on covering
all the points you need to talk about.

50
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:13,069
OK—your minute’s up, and it’s time to
talk!

51
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,069
Now what?

52
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:18,030
Part two: how to organize your answer.

53
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,409
Organizing your answer well is easy to do,
and important, but many students don’t do

54
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:23,689
it so well.

55
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:27,730
So how can you organize your answer effectively?

56
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,519
First, start with an opening phrase.

57
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,670
Say something like:

58
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,299
"I’m going to tell you about…"

59
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,799
"I’d like to talk about…"

60
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,939
"I’ve decided to talk about…"

61
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:47,340
This gives your speech a strong, clear start.

62
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,900
What next?

63
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,710
Very simple: follow the bullet points.

64
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:57,830
Say 1-2 sentences, using your notes, about
each of the three bullet points.

65
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,849
Hopefully, this will take you 30-60 seconds.

66
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:09,420
Be focused, and don’t go off topic or add
any points which don’t answer the question.

67
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,959
Every sentence should be a direct answer to
one of the points on the card.

68
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:23,540
Next, focus on the last part of the question—“…explain
how you feel about this choice now.”

69
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,140
This is the most important part of the question,
because it lets you go into more detail.

70
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,760
This isn’t just true for this question;
this is generally true for IELTS speaking

71
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,860
part two questions.

72
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,400
The three bullet points are quite simple,
and you can’t say very much about them,

73
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,430
sometimes.

74
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,830
The last part has more depth, and you should
spend more time on it.

75
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:53,410
So, try to make 3-4 sentences about the last
part of the question.

76
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,680
This should take you 30-60 seconds, again.

77
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Great!

78
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,840
You’ve finished, right?

79
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,560
Well, not quite.

80
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,110
You also need a strong finish.

81
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,690
Often, when I practice IELTS with my students,
they act surprised when they finish their

82
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,640
answers, like this:

83
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,270
“…and so I feel like I probably made the
right choice…

84
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,270
…
…

85
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,270
Finished!”

86
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,100
This doesn’t sound like you’ve finished.

87
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,760
It sounds like you’ve just run out of things
to say.

88
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,750
You should know when you’ve finished, and
you should show the examiner clearly.

89
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,430
How can you finish strongly?

90
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,500
Use a concluding phrase, such as:

91
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,210
"That’s why I feel that…"

92
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,310
"Finally, when I look back at my decision
now…"

93
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,280
"I’m glad I made the decision I did."

94
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,120
Obviously, the finishing phrases aren’t
like the opening phrases, which you can use

95
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,850
for any topic.

96
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,290
The finishing phrases will depend on the question
you get.

97
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:04,000
Just remember: you need to finish strongly,
don’t just…

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
…

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
…

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,040
Okay, I’ve finished point 2!

101
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,550
What’s next?

102
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,620
Part three: adding details to your answer.

103
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:21,800
A lot of IELTS advice says the same things:
give detailed answers, use varied vocabulary,

104
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,620
use different sentence structures.

105
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,990
OK, that’s great, it’s all true, but how?

106
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,870
And how can you use this in part two of your
IELTS speaking test?

107
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:38,440
Actually, if you follow the advice I’ve
given you so far, this will happen automatically.

108
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,690
If you make two sentences for each bullet
point, make 3-4 sentences for the last part

109
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:51,560
of the question, write down key vocabulary
to use in your notes; if you do these things,

110
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,900
your answer should already be detailed, with
good vocabulary.

111
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,280
We’ve already done a lot of the work you
need to do here.

112
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,510
What else can you do?

113
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:06,720
For each point, try to give at least one fact
and at least one opinion.

114
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,840
For example, don’t say:

115
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,310
"I had to choose between studying computer
science and studying engineering."

116
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,870
Say:

117
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,890
"I had to choose between studying computer
science and studying engineering.

118
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,720
I was interested in both, although I always
felt that studying computer science was a

119
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,900
better choice."

120
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,040
Don’t say:

121
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,210
"I decided to study computer science."

122
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,840
Instead, say:

123
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,930
"I decided to study computer science, because
I felt that it would give me more interesting

124
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,470
career opportunities."

125
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,500
This is a good, simple rule to make your answers
more detailed.

126
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,470
Always include a fact and an opinion if you
can.

127
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,490
Add details wherever you can.

128
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,970
Don’t say,

129
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,690
"It was quite a difficult decision to make."

130
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,810
Instead, say:

131
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:03,200
"It was quite a difficult decision to make,
because my parents and my teachers all gave

132
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,040
me different advice, and I didn’t know what
to do."

133
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,080
Don’t say:

134
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,390
"I feel like I made the right decision."

135
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,810
Say:

136
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:18,781
"I feel like I made the right decision, because
I really enjoy working in IT—it’s very

137
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:23,010
creative and there’s always something new
to learn."

138
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,790
Following these simple rules will make your
answers more detailed, and give you a higher

139
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,940
chance to get a better score.

140
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,690
Next, let’s look at timing.

141
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,740
Part four: how long should you speak?

142
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,129
This is simple: at least one minute.

143
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:42,900
Speaking for less than one minute will hurt
your score.

144
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,790
You can speak for up to two minutes.

145
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,600
After two minutes, the examiner will stop
you, even if you’re in the middle of your

146
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,040
sentence.

147
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,480
If the examiner stops you, that’s not necessarily
a problem.

148
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,089
It doesn’t affect your score if you go too
long.

149
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:02,940
However, if you’ve haven’t covered all
the parts of the question, that could be a

150
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,940
problem.

151
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,170
That’s why a good goal is to speak for 90
seconds.

152
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,360
This should give you enough time to say everything
you want to say.

153
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,279
So how do you do that?

154
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,129
Practice, and time yourself.

155
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:22,970
Type “IELTS part two speaking questions”
into Google and find some questions to practice

156
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,100
with.

157
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,720
First, speak and look at your timer, on your
phone or wherever.

158
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,759
Answer the same question several times.

159
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:37,210
Your goal is to cover all parts of the question
in 90 seconds.

160
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:42,010
Later, when you’re more comfortable with
this, practice your answers, but don’t look

161
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,949
at the timer.

162
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:50,019
At the end, guess how long you spoke for,
and then look at the timer to check.

163
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:54,699
If you do this a few times, you’ll start
to feel how long you need to speak for.

164
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:58,750
You’ll also know how much you can say.

165
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,900
Different people speak at different speeds.

166
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:06,740
If you can speak fast and fluently, you’ll
be able to say more in 90 seconds.

167
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,709
If you’re a slower speaker, you won’t
be able to say as much.

168
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:16,199
Practising will help you to understand how
much you can say in 90 seconds.

169
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,779
Part five: dealing with common problems.

170
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:26,470
Finally, let’s look at some problems which
students face in part two of the IELTS speaking

171
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,470
test.

172
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,790
First problem: “I don’t have anything
to say about this topic!”

173
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:37,509
Well, I chose the question for this lesson
because it’s an easier one.

174
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:41,749
“Describe an important choice you made”
Ithink is something which most people could

175
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:43,290
talk about.

176
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,170
Unfortunately, not all of the questions are
so easy or general.

177
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:54,430
For example, if the question is, “Talk about
a party which you went to.”

178
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,620
What if you haven’t been to a party for
several years?

179
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,379
What if you don’t like parties?

180
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:01,259
This could happen.

181
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:04,170
We hope it won’t, but it could.

182
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,880
What can you do?

183
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,360
First, when you’re preparing for the exam,
be strict with yourself.

184
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,990
Don’t just practice easy questions, or questions
which you think are interesting.

185
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,120
Find the most difficult question you can.

186
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,360
Find the most boring question you can.

187
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,510
Practice answering these.

188
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:28,259
Find more difficult questions, and more boring
questions, and practice them.

189
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:32,129
You need to be prepared for anything.

190
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:36,410
If the worst happens, and you get a topic
where you don’t have anything to say, you

191
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,970
have two options:

192
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,819
First, you can just lie.

193
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:44,149
The examiner really doesn’t care if you
tell the truth or not.

194
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:46,660
Make up a story if you can.

195
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,819
Otherwise, try to think of a story from a
friend, or from the news, or anything which

196
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:53,149
you could use.

197
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:58,870
For example, if the topic is “Talk about
a party which you went to,” and your friend

198
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:04,529
told you about a party that he or she went
to last week, use your friend’s story.

199
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:07,559
To be clear, don’t talk about your friend.

200
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,529
Use your friend’s story and make it about
you.

201
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:17,600
This is important: in other parts of the IELTS
exam, it can be OK to say “I don’t know,”

202
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,730
or “I don’t have anything to say about
this.”

203
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,110
But in part two, you must answer the question.

204
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,560
You can’t change the topic or adapt it.

205
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,920
What other common problems do IELTS students
have during part two of the speaking test?

206
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,980
Another common problem: “I’m so nervous!”

207
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,779
Alright, well giving a speech like this makes
a lot of people nervous or uncomfortable.

208
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,279
What can you do about this?

209
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:50,160
First of all, understand that feeling nervous
in this situation is natural.

210
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,089
Very few people can feel totally comfortable
in this kind of situation.

211
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:58,170
Is there anything you can do to feel less
nervous?

212
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,180
Well, yes, there is.

213
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,199
Try to practice making presentations or speeches
in English, in front of as many people as

214
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:10,009
possible, maybe in class or with your teacher.

215
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:14,490
Practicing speaking like this is useful anyway,
but it’s also goodto get used to feeling

216
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,260
nervous.

217
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,160
Feeling a little bit nervous doesn’t mean
your English will get worse.

218
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,160
Feeling nervous is natural; you can feel nervous
and you can still speak well.

219
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,519
It's important to understand this before your
exam.

220
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,280
Okay, part six, let's review what we've talked
about today.

221
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:42,079
To get a higher score in part two of the IELTS
speaking test, you need to prepare carefully,

222
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,060
making sure you have something to say for
each part of the question.

223
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:52,740
You should structure your speech, with a clear
beginning and ending.

224
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:59,540
Add details to your answer where possible,
especially for the last part of the question.

225
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,459
Try to speak for around 90 seconds.

226
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:08,579
And, practice in advance, including boring
questions, difficult questions, and speaking

227
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:11,740
in situations where you feel nervous.

228
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,220
Okay, think about the question we looked at
today:

229
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,889
Here it is again.

230
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:19,800
Who would you talk about?

231
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,259
What would you say?

232
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:23,689
What details could you add to your answer?

233
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:29,220
Try it for yourself, and try to use some of
the things we’ve talked about today.

234
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,910
Alright, that’s the end of the lesson.

235
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,050
Thanks very much for watching!

236
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,430
I hope you found this IELTS advice useful
in preparing for your exam.

237
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,319
