00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,140
Hi, I’m Stephanie.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,880
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,300
In this lesson, you can learn about conditional
sentences.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,160
Conditional sentences are sentences with the
word ‘if’.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,390
You can use conditional sentences to talk
about many different situations.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,700
There are also sentences which don’t use
the word ‘if’, but which follow similar

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,610
rules.

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,000
By the way, do you want English subtitles
while watching this video?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,940
Click the ‘CC’ button in the bottom right
now to turn on English subtitles if you need

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,239
them.

11
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:37,840
This is a ‘5 levels’ lesson.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,649
That means you’ll see five sections.

13
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,149
Each section will give you a challenge.

14
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:46,600
Each section is more difficult than the previous
one.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,839
If you’re a more advanced English speaker,
you should probably skip to level two.

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,620
Ready?

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,620
Let’s go!

18
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,540
Look at the five sentences.

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,940
Your job is to put the verb in brackets into
the correct form.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,820
Pause the video and do it now.

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,880
Ready?

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,780
Here are the answers.

23
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,230
So, what do you need to know here?

24
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,560
These sentences are called first conditionals.

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,580
They talk about things which could happen
in the future.

26
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,650
All conditional sentences have two parts.

27
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:36,750
They have an if-clause…
…and a *result* clause.

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,380
You need to know three basic things to make
first conditional sentences.

29
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,840
One: after ‘if’, use a present tense.

30
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,630
Here, you use the present simple.

31
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,290
Other present tenses are sometimes possible,
but you can almost always use the present

32
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,700
simple.

33
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,820
Even though you’re talking about the future,
you generally can’t use a future form after

34
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,840
‘if’; you use a present verb tense to
talk about the future.

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,200
Two: in the result clause – meaning the
other part of the sentence – use a future

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,509
form.

37
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:16,549
You can use different future forms, like ‘will’,
‘going to’, or the present continuous.

38
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:22,819
Three: you can change the order of the clauses;
you can put the if-clause at the start of

39
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:30,049
the sentence, or you can start with the result
clause, and the if-clause goes afterwards.

40
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:34,269
With these three points, you can make first
conditional sentences to talk about things

41
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:36,280
which might happen in the future.

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,300
However, there are many other kinds of conditional
sentence.

43
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,480
Let’s move on to level two!

44
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,080
Look at your sentences for level two.

45
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,180
Here, you have a different task.

46
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,739
Some of these sentences are correct, but some
are not.

47
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:59,819
Your job is to find the mistakes and correct
them.

48
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,420
Pause the video and think about it.

49
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,209
Take as much time as you need!

50
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:07,370
Could you do it?

51
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,440
Let’s look together.

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,440
Sentences one and two are correct.

53
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,480
These are called zero conditionals.

54
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,810
A zero conditional uses the present simple
in both parts of the sentence.

55
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:26,020
Use zero conditionals to talk about things
which are generally true.

56
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,279
Sentence three is incorrect, but four is correct.

57
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:32,469
Can you explain why?

58
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:35,099
‘Unless’ means ‘if not’.

59
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,169
You can’t use a negative verb after ‘unless’,
because you can’t have two negatives together

60
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:41,599
in English.

61
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,629
So, sentence three should be ‘Unless you
*have* further questions, let’s move on

62
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:50,440
to the next point.’

63
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,080
Finally, sentence five is also incorrect.

64
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,440
There are many words which behave similarly
to ‘if’.

65
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:04,180
‘Until’ is one such word; others include
‘as soon as’, ‘when’, ‘in case’

66
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,459
and ‘unless’.

67
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,459
Like with ‘if’, you can’t generally
use a future form after these words.

68
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,690
Instead, you use a present verb – usually
the present simple – to refer to the future.

69
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:26,220
So, sentence five should be ‘I can’t do
any work until my computer *is* fixed.’

70
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,520
Did you get everything right?

71
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,310
If so, great!

72
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,020
If not, don’t worry.

73
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:38,100
Remember that you can always review a section
if you need to.

74
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,540
Here are your sentences.

75
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,520
This time, you have to put both verbs into
the correct form.

76
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,500
Here’s a tip: not all the sentences follow
the same pattern.

77
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,840
Think carefully!

78
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,560
For one verb, there are two possible answers.

79
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,020
Pause the video and make your answers now.

80
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,200
Done?

81
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,180
Take a look.

82
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,509
How did you do?

83
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,100
Did you get them all right?

84
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,990
If not, what do you need to study?

85
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,229
These sentences are all second and third conditionals.

86
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:20,580
Second and third conditionals are *unreal*
conditionals.

87
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,530
That means you use them to talk about imaginary
situations – situations that didn’t really

88
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,039
happen, or won’t happen.

89
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,980
For example, look at sentence two: ‘If I
were president, I’d send everyone a cake

90
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,520
on their birthday.’

91
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,840
But, I’m not president, and I’m not going
to be.

92
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,720
It’s an unreal, imaginary situation.

93
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,340
So, no cake for you!

94
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:51,479
You use second conditionals to talk about
unreal situations in the present or future.

95
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:57,580
You use third conditionals to talk about unreal
situations in the past.

96
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,180
Look at the five sentences again.

97
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:06,200
Which ones are second conditionals, and which
are third conditionals?

98
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:13,440
One, two and four are second conditionals;
they refer to the present or the future.

99
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,819
Three and five refer to the past, so they’re
third conditionals.

100
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:23,870
If you find this difficult, start by reviewing
second conditional sentences.

101
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,860
Also, study the difference between real and
unreal conditionals.

102
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,419
Many languages don’t make a difference between
real and unreal situations like English does.

103
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:39,720
If your language doesn’t do this, then you’ll
need to pay extra attention to these unreal

104
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,259
sentences when you’re speaking English.

105
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:49,760
When you feel that you understand second conditionals
well, then learn and practise third conditionals.

106
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,110
So, is that it?

107
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,240
Have we seen all the possible types of conditional
sentences?

108
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,870
Not quite yet.

109
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,690
In level four, let’s do something a little
different.

110
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,509
Look at the sentences to begin.

111
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:10,689
You have two jobs here.

112
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:14,530
One: are both verb forms possible, or not?

113
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,520
If not, which one is right?

114
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,900
Two: if both are possible, is there any difference
in meaning?

115
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,540
If so, what?

116
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,780
Pause the video now.

117
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:29,699
You know what to do!

118
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:35,389
OK, before we look at the answers, here’s
a clue: there’s only one sentence where

119
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,870
both verb forms are possible.

120
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,590
If that’s news to you, then feel free to
pause again and take more time to think about

121
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,300
it.

122
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,520
Ready now?

123
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,900
Let’s check!

124
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,050
Like in level three, all these sentences are
*unreal* conditionals.

125
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,050
They’re talking about things which didn’t
happen or won’t happen in reality.

126
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,630
But, these are mixed conditionals.

127
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:08,150
That means the one part of the sentence is
about the present or future, and the other

128
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,770
part is about the past.

129
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:18,030
For example, in sentence two, the first clause
– which is the result clause – is about

130
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,430
the present, and the if-clause is about the
past.

131
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,700
In sentence three, the result clause is about
the future, and the if-clause is about the

132
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,500
past.

133
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,380
In sentence one, both forms are possible.

134
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,680
Sentence one can also be a third conditional,
referring to the past.

135
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:44,000
However, it can also be a mixed conditional,
with the if-clause referring to the present,

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,920
and the result clause referring to the past.

137
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,340
Here’s the question you probably want an
answer to: what’s the difference between

138
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,110
using the two forms in sentence one?

139
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,500
Can you explain it?

140
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,860
If you use ‘wasn’t’, and say ‘if she
wasn’t so shy’, then you’re referring

141
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,839
to the present.

142
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,720
This suggests that she’s generally shy – this
is part of her personality.

143
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,880
If you say ‘if she hadn’t been so shy’,
then you’re referring to the past.

144
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,820
This suggests that she was shy during her
stay here, but maybe she’s not shy all the

145
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,820
time.

146
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,370
This is a small difference, but it is a difference
nonetheless.

147
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,300
Another question: how do you know there’s
only one possibility for sentences two to

148
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,860
five?

149
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,860
It’s because all these sentences contain
a time marker.

150
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,560
For example, sentences two and four include
the word ‘now’.

151
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,620
So, they must be about the present.

152
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:54,840
Sentences three and five contain time markers
which clearly refer to the past.

153
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,900
So, what should you do if you found this difficult?

154
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:06,339
First, review second and third conditionals,
and how to form them.

155
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:12,220
If you have difficulties with the formation
of second or third conditional sentences,

156
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,580
then you’ll struggle with mixed conditionals,
too.

157
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:22,660
Then, try to make some mixed conditional sentences
about your life.

158
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,910
Think of things you did – or didn’t do
– in the past, which could have made a difference

159
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,399
to your life now.

160
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,750
Or, think about your personality traits, and
how your past might have been different if

161
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,990
you had a different personality.

162
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,580
If you want extra practise, add your examples
in the comments!

163
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,279
OK, there’s one more section.

164
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,670
Are you ready for the toughest challenge?

165
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,440
Look at your level five sentences.

166
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,769
Your job is to complete each sentence with
*one* word.

167
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:04,910
There’s only one answer that makes sense,
except for number five, where there are at

168
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,830
least two possible answers.

169
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,620
Pause the video and find your answers.

170
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,320
Could you do it?

171
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,110
These sentences test some extremely specific
grammar knowledge.

172
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,050
Let’s see the answers.

173
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,970
So, can you explain what’s happening here?

174
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:33,040
Some of these sentence might look strange
or wrong, but they’re all correct.

175
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,050
By the way, in sentence five, ‘would’
is – we think – the most likely answer,

176
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,970
but ‘will’ and ‘could’ are also possible.

177
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:49,680
In sentence one, using the present perfect,
instead of the present simple, means that

178
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,800
this person has already taken their English
exam, but doesn’t know the results yet.

179
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,759
Usually in first conditional sentences, you
might be able to use other present tenses,

180
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,880
but you can always use the present simple.

181
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,320
However, there’s one case where you *must*
use the present perfect.

182
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,410
If you’re talking about the future consequences
of something which happened in the past, you

183
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,779
need the present perfect after ‘if’.

184
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:26,589
In this case, the event – the exam – is
in the past, but the consequences – meaning

185
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:30,840
the results – are in the future.

186
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,980
Sentence two is a more formal or literary
style.

187
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,710
The more common pattern would be ‘if you
had told us sooner…’

188
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:44,550
You can use this formal style if the first
verb after ‘if’ is ‘had’, ‘should’

189
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,550
or ‘were’.

190
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,430
To form the sentence, you do two things.

191
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,440
One: you omit ‘if’.

192
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,240
Two: you move the auxiliary verb – ‘had’,
‘should’ or ‘were’ – before the

193
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,660
subject.

194
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,980
It’s never necessary to use this pattern;
you can always use a regular conditional,

195
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,690
with ‘if’, instead.

196
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,980
What about sentence three?

197
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,370
In second conditional sentences, if the verb
after ‘if’ describes an action, you can

198
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,170
add ‘were to’ before the verb.

199
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:24,810
This emphasises that the situation is very
distant or unlikely.

200
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:29,370
When you use this, you’re saying ‘I really
don’t think this will happen.’

201
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:35,720
In this case, the interviewer is probably
not very positive about this candidate!

202
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,740
Again, you never need to use this structure.

203
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:47,040
You could make a regular second conditional:
‘if we decided to hire you…’

204
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,980
In sentence four, what do you think is happening?

205
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,130
You might be thinking: you can’t use ‘will’
after ‘if’ in a conditional sentence.

206
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:01,470
That’s generally true, but this sentence
isn’t really a conditional.

207
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:07,709
‘If’ here does not express a condition;
it is similar in meaning to ‘in case’.

208
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:12,810
You can understand the sentence as ‘You
can take it, because it might help you.’

209
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:18,629
So, the regular rules about first conditionals
don’t apply here, and you can – and should

210
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:22,350
– use ‘will’ after ‘if’.

211
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,750
Sentence five might also look weird to some
of you.

212
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,540
Can you explain it?

213
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,350
Why is there only one part?

214
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,800
Don’t conditionals need to have two parts?

215
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,040
Like with number four, this isn’t a conditional.

216
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,910
It’s a formal way of making a request.

217
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:44,880
The meaning is equivalent to ‘Would you
please follow me?’

218
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,990
Because it isn’t a conditional, it doesn’t
need a result clause – you can just use

219
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,819
an if-clause by itself.

220
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:58,610
Remember that this is a formal style, and
you’re not likely to hear it or use it often.

221
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,650
Now, we have one final question for you: what
