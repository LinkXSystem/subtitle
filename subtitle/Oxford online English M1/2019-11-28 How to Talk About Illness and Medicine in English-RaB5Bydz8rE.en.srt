00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,490
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,060
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,010
In this lesson, you can learn how to talk
about illness, medicine and healthcare in

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,010
English.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,840
You’ll learn how to deal with a visit to
the doctor’s office, how to talk about different

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,380
healthcare systems, how to talk about going
to hospital, and more.

Take a look: Oxford Online English dot com.

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:51,100
Let’s start by looking at language you can
use if you need to see a doctor.

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,559
So, what can I do for you today?

14
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:58,070
Well, I’ve been having these headaches,
just behind my eyes.

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,030
How long have you been having them?

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,420
For about a week now.

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,120
They aren’t constant—they come and go,
but they’re really painful.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,480
Do you have a fever?

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,020
No, I don’t think so.

20
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,880
Any respiratory symptoms?

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,880
How do you mean?

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,409
For example, do you have a blocked nose, a
sore throat, a cough, or anything like that?

23
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,549
No, nothing like that.

24
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:22,030
Is this the first time you’ve had a problem
like this?

25
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,079
As far as I can remember, yeah.

26
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,180
OK, please sit on the bed over here.

27
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,450
I need to check your pulse and blood pressure.

28
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,229
I’ll also need to check your lymph nodes
to see if they’re swollen.

29
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:36,479
In the dialogue, the doctor asked many questions.

30
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,540
Can you remember any?

31
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,729
Typically, the doctor will ask about your
symptoms, your medical history, and about

32
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,060
medication which you’re taking.

33
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:52,000
To ask about your symptoms, the doctor might
ask ‘Do you have a fever?’

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,240
‘Do you have a cough?’

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,320
‘Do you have a sore throat?’

36
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,000
The doctor might ask more questions about
a specific symptom.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,360
For example: ‘How long have you been feeling
like this?’

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,780
‘Is this the first time you’ve had a problem
like this?’

39
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,950
‘How severe is the pain?’

40
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,870
If you’re describing your symptoms, it’s
common to use the present perfect tense, especially

41
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,519
for a problem that appears repeatedly.

42
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,940
For example: ‘I’ve been having really
bad headaches.’

43
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,020
‘I’ve been having some stomach problems.’

44
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,260
‘I’ve been having a lot of problems getting
to sleep.’

45
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:47,739
You could also add a time period, as in: ‘I’ve
had this cough for a week now.’

46
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:53,030
To describe more stable symptoms, use the
present simple tense.

47
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,260
For example: ‘I have a swelling in my right
knee.’

48
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,760
‘I have this rash on my arm.’

49
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,660
After you describe your symptoms, the doctor
might do some basic checks on you.

50
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:14,400
For example, he or she might want to take your pulse
check your blood pressure

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,780
or listen to your heartbeat or breathing using
a stethoscope.

52
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,620
Next, the doctor will suggest further treatment,
and possibly prescribe medicine for you to

53
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,360
take.

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,100
Are you taking any medication currently?

55
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,720
No, nothing.

56
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Any allergies?

57
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
No.

58
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,650
I’m going to prescribe you some painkillers.

59
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,480
Take one as soon as you feel your headaches
starting.

60
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,260
If you’re still in pain after an hour, take
a second one.

61
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:51,480
Don’t take more than two pills in four hours,
or more than six pills in a 24-hour period.

62
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,640
OK…

63
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,780
Also, don’t drink alcohol or take any other
anti-inflammatories while you’re taking

64
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,520
these.

65
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,960
Can’t you do some more tests?

66
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,750
What if it’s something more serious?

67
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,620
If you’re still having the same problem
in two weeks, then we’ll need to investigate

68
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,019
further.

69
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:10,769
These things often clear up by themselves.

70
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:16,200
You should also make sure you get enough sleep,
stay hydrated, and avoid stress if possible.

71
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,420
Do I have to pay for the prescription?

72
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,900
You pay a seven-pound prescription fee.

73
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,710
I’m giving you enough pills to last four
weeks, so you should have enough.

74
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,280
Can I take it to any chemist’s?

75
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,980
Yes, of course.

76
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,820
There’s a pharmacy in the supermarket around
the corner.

77
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,550
You could get your medicine there.

78
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,420
OK, I’ll do that.

79
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,940
Thank you.

80
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,480
Doctors can prescribe you medicine or other
treatments.

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,610
They do this by writing what you need on a
piece of paper—a prescription.

82
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,330
‘Prescribe’ is the verb, and ‘prescription’
is the noun.

83
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:55,200
You can also use the noun ‘prescription’
to refer to the medicine which a doctor prescribes

84
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,000
for you.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,600
For example, you could say: ‘The doctor
prescribed antihistamines, but they didn’t

86
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,360
help.’

87
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,030
‘I lost my prescription, so I’ll have
to call the doctor and see if she can send

88
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,860
me a replacement.’

89
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,660
Antihistamines are often taken by people who
have allergies.

90
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,520
In the dialogue, do you remember what kind
of medicine the doctor prescribed?

91
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,550
She prescribed painkillers.

92
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,180
Common painkillers are paracetamol and ibuprofen.

93
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:34,600
Painkillers may also be anti-inflammatories—they
reduce fever and swelling.

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,960
After you have your prescription, you can
collect your medicine from a pharmacy—also

95
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,980
called a chemist’s in UK English, although
both words are used.

96
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:49,240
The doctor or pharmacist might also give you
advice on how to take your medicine.

97
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,240
For example: ‘Take one pill every twelve
hours.’

98
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,460
‘Make sure you take the pills with food.’

99
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:05,660
‘Avoid alcohol while you’re taking these,
or they might not be as effective.’

100
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,040
Finally, the doctor might also give you some
more general advice.

101
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,630
In the dialogue, the doctor mentioned three
things.

102
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,540
Do you remember them?

103
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,490
I said ‘You should also make sure
you get enough sleep, stay hydrated, and avoid

104
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,120
stress if possible.’

105
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,580
Last question for this section: what happens
if you don’t stay hydrated?

106
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,830
If you don’t stay hydrated by drinking enough
fluids, you’ll get dehydrated.

107
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:42,480
Next, let’s look at language to use if you
aren’t sure where to go or how to get medical

108
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,260
help.

109
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,040
So, weird question, but what do I do if I
need to see a doctor?

110
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,850
I’ve never been to hospital or anything
here, and I have no idea how it works.

111
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,850
You have insurance?

112
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,850
No.

113
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,850
No?

114
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,830
Anyway, what’s wrong with you?

115
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,830
Nothing much.

116
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,530
I have this swelling in my wrist, and it’s
a little uncomfortable to move it.

117
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,110
I’d just like to get it checked out.

118
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,450
Well, you could go to a public hospital.

119
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,950
I think as a resident you’re entitled to
free public healthcare, but even if you have

120
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,470
to pay, it won’t be much.

121
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,710
You might have to wait for a long time, though.

122
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,190
You mean, you have to wait to see a doctor?

123
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:27,490
Yes, that too, but I meant that after you
see a doctor, it might be a long time before

124
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,510
you get any treatment.

125
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,710
From what I hear, the public health system
is really overstretched at the moment, and

126
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,830
people have to wait weeks or months for treatment.

127
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,590
So, you have private health insurance?

128
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,490
Yeah, most people do.

129
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,270
You could also go to a private clinic, or
just go to a GP and let him or her refer you

130
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,170
to the right specialist if you need further
treatment.

131
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,760
Would that be very expensive?

132
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,160
A GP appointment normally costs about 40 or
50 Euros.

133
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,620
For further treatment, it depends what you
need, obviously.

134
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,580
Of course, if you’re uninsured, it’ll
be more expensive, but it’s not likely to

135
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,940
be ridiculous.

136
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,520
Maybe I’ll do that, then.

137
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,780
I’d prefer to get it looked at sooner.

138
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,600
Can you recommend anyone?

139
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,400
I can give you the details for my GP.

140
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,220
There’s also a website I can show you where
you can find a doctor closer to where you

141
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,900
live, if you like.

142
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,060
That sounds great.

143
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,680
Thanks.

144
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,380
In your country, if you need to see a doctor,
what do you do first?

145
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:32,220
Can you go directly to a hospital, or do you
need to go to a GP or smaller clinic first?

146
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,420
Let’s take the UK as an example.

147
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:40,740
Most people in the UK use public healthcare,
which is almost completely free.

148
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,680
Some people choose to buy private insurance,
which can give you more choice about where

149
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,580
and when you get treatment.

150
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,130
If you’re using public healthcare, you’ll
generally register with a GP.

151
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:58,510
‘GP’ stands for ‘general practitioner’,
meaning a doctor who doesn’t specialise

152
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,100
in one area.

153
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,280
GPs mostly work in small clinics, not in hospitals.

154
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,300
If you have a problem, you’ll go to your
GP first.

155
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,670
Your GP will then help you to arrange further
treatment if you need it.

156
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:19,630
For example, your GP might refer you to a
specialist if you need more targeted treatment.

157
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,180
In other countries, most people have healthcare
insurance.

158
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,680
In some places, healthcare can be very expensive
if you’re uninsured.

159
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,650
What about in your country?

160
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,620
Look at three questions:

161
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:38,120
One: do most people use public healthcare,
or is it more usual to buy private health

162
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,280
insurance?

163
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,370
Two: is public healthcare high-quality and
reliable?

164
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,020
Why or why not?

165
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:54,640
Three: are all residents entitled to free
public healthcare, or are there restrictions?

166
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,740
Could you answer these questions?

167
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,740
Try it!

168
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,240
Say an answer out loud, or write it down.

169
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,340
Or, do both!

170
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,980
Remember that you might need to repeat and
practise your answer several times, so that

171
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,520
it is fluent and clear.

172
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,740
Did you do it?

173
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,940
If so, feel free to share your answers with
other learners in the comments.

174
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,560
Let’s move on.

175
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:29,170
What happens if you have a more serious health
issue, and you need to stay in hospital?

176
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,950
Have you heard about what happened to Louis?

177
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,290
No, what?

178
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,820
He went to the doctor’s for a routine check-up,
and they discovered he had a major cardiac

179
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,580
problem.

180
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,160
They sent him to A&E right away; they wouldn’t
let him go home even for an hour.

181
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,330
Then, he had surgery the same day.

182
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,330
No way!

183
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,700
I saw him on Tuesday.

184
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,400
He looked absolutely fine.

185
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,880
Yeah, I was shocked, too.

186
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,750
Anyway, we should go and see him, don’t
you think?

187
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,960
He would probably appreciate some company.

188
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Sure…

189
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,500
How long are they keeping him in?

190
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,170
From what I heard, they want to monitor him
for a few days, and then he can go home.

191
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,230
So, when can we go?

192
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,980
Do they have set visiting hours?

193
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,600
Yeah, it’s in the afternoon some time.

194
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
I can check on their website.

195
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,550
Let me check with his wife, too, because I’m
sure she’ll be spending time there, and

196
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,650
I think there’s a two-visitor maximum.

197
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,160
I hope he’s alright.

198
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,230
I’ve never had an operation or had to stay
overnight in hospital, but I imagine it’s

199
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,230
fairly miserable.

200
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,030
Yup, you’re not wrong.

201
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,780
Hopefully he’ll be discharged soon.

202
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,610
We should take him some fruit or something
nice to eat.

203
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,610
Can we do that?

204
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,020
I think so, but I’ll check to be sure.

205
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:44,500
Look at a sentence from the dialogue: ‘They
sent him to A&E right away.’

206
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,600
Do you know what ‘A&E’ means?

207
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,850
A&E stands for ‘accident and emergency’.

208
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,920
It’s the hospital department where you go
if you have a serious medical issue.

209
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,060
In American English it’s commonly called
‘ER’—‘emergency room’.

210
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,580
Let’s look at four more sentences from the
dialogue.

211
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,650
In each sentence, there’s a word missing.

212
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,400
Can you remember the missing words?

213
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,760
If not, you can also go back and review the
dialogue to find them, if you want!

214
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,100
Did you find the missing words?

215
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,900
Let’s look.

216
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,110
‘How long are they keeping him in?’

217
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,270
means ‘How long will he have to stay in
hospital?’

218
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:34,240
‘They’ here refers to the hospital staff.

219
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,500
Hospitals have visiting hours, when you can
go and spend time with your friends and relatives

220
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,800
who are staying there.

221
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:48,180
Even if you need to go to hospital, you might
be an outpatient, meaning that you go to hospital,

222
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,610
do what you need, and then go home again.

223
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:57,070
The opposite is ‘inpatient’, meaning that
you need to stay overnight.

224
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,990
When you’re ready to leave hospital and
go home, they discharge you.

225
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,280
You can discharge yourself earlier, but your
doctors might try to persuade you to stay

226
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,440
longer.

227
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:15,120
Now, let’s look at our final section: recovering
from a health problem.

228
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,610
So, how are you feeling?

229
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,260
Quite fragile, to be honest.

230
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,310
I mean, I feel better than I did, but it’s
a long process.

231
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,730
Well, that’s to be expected.

232
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,060
You had a major operation.

233
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,840
How long do they say it’ll take to recover?

234
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,980
They don’t give exact answers to things
like that.

235
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,340
I guess every case is different, but they
said I should be back to normal in around

236
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,690
three months.

237
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,730
Three months?!

238
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,680
Obviously I won’t be like this for three
months, or at least I hope not.

239
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,860
I get tired so easily right now.

240
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,490
They told me I should get some strength back
in a couple of weeks.

241
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,930
Do you have to go back in for any more tests?

242
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,170
I have to go tomorrow to get the incision
cleaned and dressed.

243
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,460
It’s a big wound, so that’ll take a while
to heal just by itself.

244
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,620
Apart from that, I think I have to go back
in a month or so for an ECG.

245
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,220
Maybe there’s more, but I’m not focusing
on that right now.

246
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,910
One day at a time!

247
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,279
Do you need any help with anything?

248
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,490
Please ask if you do.

249
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,180
I’d love to help if I can.

250
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,030
That’s kind of you!

251
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,770
If you want, you could take me for a walk.

252
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,210
I’m not supposed to go outside by myself,
but it’s nice to get some fresh air.

253
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:28,430
I start going crazy if I’m just stuck in
bed or at home all day.

254
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,940
Sure, how about tomorrow?

255
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,780
That would be great!

256
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,380
Come by any time.

257
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,920
Let’s look at some language you heard in
the dialogue.

258
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,990
Do you remember how this language was used?

259
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,860
Could you explain what these sentences mean?

260
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:50,120
Remember, you can pause the video to think,
or go back and review the dialogue if you

261
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,980
need to.

262
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,910
‘Fragile’ is similar to weak.

263
00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:00,120
It’s often used to describe things which
break easily, like china plates or things

264
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,170
made of glass.

265
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:06,470
If you’re feeling fragile, you feel weak
and ill.

266
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,000
If you’re recovering from a serious illness
or an operation, you’ll need to get your

267
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,380
strength back.

268
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,670
You also heard the phrase ‘get back to normal’.

269
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:20,280
For example: ‘It’ll take a few weeks to
get back to normal.’

270
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,820
A wound is an opening or a cut in your skin.

271
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,290
If you have an operation, the surgeon will
need to make an opening in your skin, which

272
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,060
needs to heal afterwards.

273
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:36,720
Finally, ‘one day at a time’ is a phrase
which means you focus on the present, rather

274
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,160
than thinking about the future.

275
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,480
You can use it when you’re dealing with
a difficult or complex situation.

276
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,630
You can also use the longer phrase ‘take
things one day at a time.’

277
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,560
For example: ‘Everything’s so busy right
now.

278
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,430
I can’t make plans for next year.

279
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,400
I’m just taking things one day at a time.’

280
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,680
Of course, we hope you don’t need the language
you’ve seen in this lesson.

281
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,230
But, we still hope it was useful for you.

282
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,970
Thanks for watching!

283
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,660
See you next time!
