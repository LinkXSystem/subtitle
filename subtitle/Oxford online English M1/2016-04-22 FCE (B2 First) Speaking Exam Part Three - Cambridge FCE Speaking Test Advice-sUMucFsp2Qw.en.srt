1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,490
Hello.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,490
I'm Mia.

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,400
In this lesson, you can learn about the Cambridge
FCE speaking exam, part three.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,740
Do you know what to expect in this part of
the exam or what the examiners are looking

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,740
for?

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,810
In this lesson, you can see what will happen
in part three of the speaking test and how

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,160
to improve your score.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,020
Part One: what to expect in part three of
the FCE speaking exam.

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,700
So what happens in part three of your FCE
speaking test?

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,570
Part three of the exam is divided into two
parts.

12
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:50,570
In the first part, you and your partner will
be given five written prompts and asked a

13
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,570
question.

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,530
You'll have about two minutes to discuss the
question.

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,620
Look at a sample question.

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:05,210
In this example, the question is, "Why might
people choose to wear these different clothes?"

17
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,180
All of these questions have a similar format.

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,530
The question is in the centre with five prompts
around the sides.

19
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:18,630
After you finish talking to your partner,
the examiner will ask you and your partner

20
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,740
a question about the subject you've just discussed.

21
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,860
For example, "Which of these clothes would
people feel more comfortable wearing?"

22
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,549
Or, "Which clothes would be best to wear for
a job interview?"

23
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,070
You'll have about one minute to discuss this
question with your partner.

24
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:46,479
So what do you need to do to improve your
score in part three of the FCE speaking test?

25
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,069
Part Two: interactive communication and improving
your score.

26
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:58,429
Like the other parts of the FCE speaking exam,
you are given scores for grammar, vocabulary,

27
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:03,189
discourse management--whether you can speak
fluently and coherently--and pronunciation.

28
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:10,310
In part three, you also get a score for interactive
communication.

29
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:16,070
This means that your score depends partly
on how you communicate with your partner.

30
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,750
This means it's important to work with your
partner and speak together.

31
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:27,020
In our videos in part one and part two of
the FCE speaking exam, we've discussed how

32
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,100
to improve your grammar, vocabulary, and discourse
management scores.

33
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:40,080
Now, let's focus on your interactive communication
score and what you can do to improve it.

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,060
So what are the examiners looking for?

35
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,790
The examiners want to know: can you begin
a conversation?

36
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:53,170
Are you able to listen and respond to your
partner in an appropriate way?

37
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,230
Can you keep the conversation going?

38
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,060
Can you ask your partner questions?

39
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:05,291
Can you take turns with your partner, speaking
when it's your turn but also giving your partner

40
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,080
the chance to speak?

41
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,060
Here are some good ways to improve your interactive
communication score.

42
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,390
Take short turns.

43
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,910
It's a good idea to take short turns when
speaking with your partner.

44
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:27,120
This way, the conversation moves quickly,
and you can discuss more of the written prompts.

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,030
First, don't speak for too long.

46
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,670
Express an idea, and then ask your partner
a question.

47
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:40,040
When your partner speaks, comment on what
they say and ask new questions.

48
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,260
This way, you will sound natural and engaged.

49
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,760
This will improve your score on the exam.

50
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,700
Use body language.

51
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,340
Body language is an important part of expressing
yourself.

52
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,600
Turn towards your partner, and make eye contact.

53
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,970
Remember, you're talking to your partner,
not to the examiners.

54
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:07,290
This will also make the conversation more
natural and help you to relax.

55
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,590
Make sure you look interested in what your
partner is saying.

56
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,650
Even if they're the most boring person you've
ever met, you need to pay attention to what

57
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,759
they're saying so that you can respond appropriately.

58
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,470
Express your opinions.

59
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,960
It's good to agree and disagree with your
partner.

60
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,699
This will help you to express your opinions
and have a more natural conversation.

61
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,830
Make sure you disagree politely so that you
don't offend your partner.

62
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:43,990
For example, "I disagree that a dress and
high heels would be a good choice for going

63
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,210
out with friends.

64
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:51,099
I think that jeans and a jumper could be a
lot more comfortable, and you could make them

65
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:54,389
look stylish, too."

66
00:04:54,389 --> 00:05:00,979
While this answer expresses disagreement,
it's also polite and helps to move the conversation

67
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:03,080
forward.

68
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,780
Ask questions.

69
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,600
It's always a good idea to ask your partner
questions.

70
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,830
They could be simple or complex.

71
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:19,210
A good time to ask a question is after you
disagree with your partner.

72
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:25,240
Look at the previous example again, "I think
that jeans and a jumper could be a lot more

73
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,349
comfortable, and you could make them look
stylish, too.

74
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:31,580
What about shorts and a T-shirt?

75
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,189
When do you think people might wear them?"

76
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:41,499
Asking your partner a question after you disagree
with them moves the conversation forward and

77
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:43,580
stops any possible arguments.

78
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:50,099
It will also give you a higher score in your
interactive communication mark.

79
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:53,930
Part Three: useful phrases and expressions.

80
00:05:53,930 --> 00:06:00,360
Next, let's look at some useful phrases and
expressions that you can use in this part

81
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,930
of the FCE speaking test.

82
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:09,680
Firstly, it's a good idea to ask your partner
if they would like to start the conversation.

83
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,729
You are showing the examiner that you can
begin the conversation, and at the same time,

84
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:19,680
giving yourself more time to think about the
task.

85
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,620
You could say, "Would you like to begin?"

86
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,979
Or if you're more confident and want to dive
straight in, "Shall I start?"

87
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:35,840
Now that you've begun, let's look at some
phrases you can use to agree with your partner.

88
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,509
You could simply say, "I agree with you,"
or, "That's a good idea."

89
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:45,680
However, these phrases are quite basic and
can be repetitive.

90
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,319
Try using some more interesting phrases, such
as, "I see your point," or, "You make some

91
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,909
great points."

92
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:58,009
Or if you really agree with them, "I couldn't
agree with you more."

93
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:00,499
"You're absolutely right."

94
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:03,569
So what do you do if you disagree?

95
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:10,229
If you disagree, it's a good idea to use a
polite phrase and keep the conversation moving.

96
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:15,219
This will make you sound more fluid and avoid
getting into arguments.

97
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:23,400
You could tell your partner, "I'm not sure
I agree," or, "I get your point, but..." or,

98
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,780
"That's one way of looking at it.

99
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,110
On the other hand..."

100
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:34,360
You can see that all these phrases allow you
to continue and explain your point, helping

101
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,129
you to keep the conversation moving.

102
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:42,379
Part Four: how to deal with difficult partners.

103
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,379
Okay.

104
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,839
But what if your partner isn't letting you
speak?

105
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,860
What if your partner isn't taking part in
the conversation at all?

106
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,349
What can you do?

107
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:53,349
Don't worry.

108
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:58,689
This is unlikely to happen, but knowing what
to do in this situation will help you feel

109
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:01,729
more confident in your speaking test.

110
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:07,199
Firstly, imagine that you're in the exam and
your partner won't stop talking about the

111
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,749
same point.

112
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,460
What do you do?

113
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,409
You interrupt them.

114
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:17,919
Be polite about it, and say something like,
"That's an interesting point, but what about

115
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:25,350
this idea?" or, "Okay, let's discuss this
point next," or, "Shall we move on to this

116
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,729
point now?"

117
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:32,479
These phrases will show that you need to continue
with the task and will also give you a higher

118
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,659
score because you are interacting with them
and moving the conversation forward.

119
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:44,370
Now, imagine that you're in the exam with
the same partner, only this time they don't

120
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,380
want to talk.

121
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,940
They are very shy and quiet and don't speak
much to you.

122
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,000
What would you do in this situation?

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,399
In this situation, it's a good idea to ask
your partner questions.

124
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,260
Of course, you should ask your partner questions
anyway.

125
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,149
But if they really don't speak much, ask them
more.

126
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:07,360
You could simply ask, "What do you think?"

127
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,120
"Which do you prefer?"

128
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,370
"Do you think it's a good idea to...?"

129
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,200
Or you could ask more specific questions.

130
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,900
For example, "What's your opinion on these
clothes?" or, "What are your views on this

131
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,269
question?"

132
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:30,190
Now that you've seen some useful phrases,
we'll look at some sample questions and answers.

133
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,829
Part Five: sample questions and answers.

134
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:41,089
Now, let's start putting all of that information
together and looking at how to make great

135
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:42,089
answers.

136
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:45,089
Have a look at this question.

137
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:51,600
The question is, "Why are these inventions
important in everyday life?"

138
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:59,019
Your partner begins and says, "In my opinion,
computers and mobile phones are the most important

139
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:03,600
inventions because we use them for everything
in our day-to-day lives."

140
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:12,019
Now, look at this sample answer, "I think
that all of these inventions are very important

141
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:16,250
in modern society, and we use most of them
every day.

142
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,610
However, I don't think it's as important to
have separate mobile phones and computers

143
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,480
as nowadays we have smart phones which are
like small computers."

144
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,910
This answer is grammatically good and uses
a variety of vocabulary.

145
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,670
However, there's a big problem here.

146
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,050
Can you see the problem?

147
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:41,120
The problem is that there isn't any interaction
with the partner.

148
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,850
Your partner has just made an interesting
statement, which you haven't responded to

149
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:46,850
at all.

150
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,060
But don't worry.

151
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,110
This is easily fixed.

152
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,970
Have a look again.

153
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,820
"That's a good point.

154
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,490
However, I don't think it's as important to
have separate mobile phones and computers

155
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,660
as nowadays we have smart phones which are
like small computers.

156
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,639
What's your opinion on this?"

157
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,220
This is much better.

158
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:13,920
Remember, you need to take short turns at
speaking with plenty of interaction with your

159
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
partner.

160
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,949
Don't talk for too long.

161
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:23,320
Now, imagine that you have discussed all of
the prompts with your partner.

162
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:31,130
The examiner asks you, "Which of these inventions
do you think is the least important?"

163
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:37,600
You have one minute to discuss this new question
and reach some sort of conclusion.

164
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,730
Take a look at this answer, "In my opinion,
the dishwasher is the least important because

165
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,880
it's not necessary to use one to clean your
plates and things.

166
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,510
What do you think?"

167
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,470
This is okay, but it's a common problem to
answer the question too early.

168
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,550
Remember, you have about a minute for the
question.

169
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:07,699
Now, have a look at this answer, "From what
you said earlier, I liked your idea that computers

170
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:12,920
are less necessary these days because everyone
has smart phones and tablets.

171
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:18,120
Do you think that this means that computers
aren't important any more?"

172
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:25,009
This is a good answer because you're discussing
the question in depth with your partner.

173
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:31,389
You're asking questions and referring back
to your partner's past answers.

174
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:37,149
This shows the examiner that you can have
a complex conversation.

175
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:42,680
This would get you a higher score in your
interactive communication.

176
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,639
Now that we've looked at what you can expect
in part three of your FCE speaking exam and

177
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,269
some useful tips and phrases, I hope you're
feeling confident and ready for your test.

178
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:56,879
Good luck!

179
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,430
That's the end of the lesson.

180
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,170
