00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,650
Hi, my name’s Marie.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,840
welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,639
In this video, we’re going to show you how
to add emphasis while speaking English.

4
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:12,870
But what does it mean to add emphasis?

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:20,010
Adding emphasis is a way to show your listener
that certain words or ideas are more important.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,170
In this lesson, you’ll see how to use different
pronunciation features and grammar structures

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,260
to add emphasis to your spoken or written
English.

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,730
Another thing: don’t forget to turn on subtitles
if you need them!

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,460
This video has English subtitles; click the
‘CC’ button on the video player to turn

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,720
them on.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,720
On your mobile phone, use the settings icon.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:49,060
Let’s start with one of the most common
ways to add emphasis to an idea.

13
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,180
What time is John flying to Paris tomorrow?

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,260
He isn’t flying to Paris *tomorrow.*
Did you hear the stressed word?

15
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,210
Which one was it?

16
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,530
Hopefully, you heard that ‘tomorrow’,
was stressed.

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,250
Why do you think this is?

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,590
Before we answer that question, let’s have a look
at three more examples.

19
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,020
Listen for the stressed words and think about what the stress means.

20
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,900
What time is John flying to Paris tomorrow?

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,100
He isn’t *flying* to Paris tomorrow.

22
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,499
What time is John flying to Paris tomorrow?

23
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:24,369
*He* isn’t flying to Paris tomorrow.

24
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:26,729
What time is John flying to Paris tomorrow?

25
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,080
He isn’t flying to Paris tomorrow.

26
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,120
In the first sentence, ‘flying’ was stressed.

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,860
In the second, ‘he’ was stressed.

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,300
And the third?

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,209
There were no stressed words!

30
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:39,759
Trick question.

31
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,060
When you stress one word, you show that this
idea is more important.

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,960
Often, you do this to show contrast with an
opposite idea, or to disagree with someone.

33
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,600
In the first sentence, adding stress to ‘flying’ means that he is going to Paris

34
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:58,950
tomorrow, but that he isn’t going
by plane.

35
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,200
Maybe he’s taking the Eurostar train

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,420
or driving.

37
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,720
What about the second sentence?

38
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,940
What does it mean if you stress the word ‘he’?

39
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,380
This suggests that other people
we know are flying to Paris tomorrow, but

40
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,800
‘*he’* isn’t.

41
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,740
What about our first example?

42
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,360
What does it mean if you stress the word ‘tomorrow’?

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,140
Think about it.

44
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,750
Adding stress to ‘tomorrow’ means
he is flying to Paris, but not tomorrow.

45
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,090
Maybe he’s flying today, or the day after
tomorrow.

46
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,360
Adding word stress is a simple way to add
emphasis to your idea.

47
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,840
This is especially useful when you want to
correct someone, or disagree with somebody

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,900
else.

49
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,280
So, what did you think of the movie?

50
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,960
Amazing!

51
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,180
It was so tense!

52
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,440
Yeah, I saw you jump so many times!

53
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,460
I know!

54
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,040
*Never* have I been so scared.

55
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,380
That basement scene was so frightening, I
could hardly watch.

56
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,720
And the ending!

57
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,780
What a twist!

58
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,040
At no point did I see that coming.

59
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,680
What was the director’s name again?

60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,020
Maria Thornby, I think.

61
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,440
Not only did she direct it, but she also wrote
and starred in it too!

62
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,880
She’s one to watch, then.

63
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,380
Look at two sentences.

64
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,540
You heard one of these in the dialogue.

65
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,360
Do you remember which?

66
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,000
You heard number two.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,260
Next question: what’s the difference between
these two sentences?

68
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:36,400
The structure in sentence two is called an
inversion.

69
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,900
This is another way to add emphasis to your
ideas.

70
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:47,040
When you make an inversion, you do two things:
first, you start the sentence with an adverb,

71
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,560
like ‘never’, ‘only’, ‘not only’
or ‘at no point’.

72
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,250
The adverb can be a single word or a phrase.

73
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,950
Secondly, you put an auxiliary verb before
the main verb.

74
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,510
You can make inversions in different verb
tenses.

75
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,640
For example, look at four sentences.

76
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,960
Can you say what verb tenses they are?

77
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Could you do it?

78
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,320
Pause the video if you want more
time to think.

79
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,220
Sentence one is past perfect.

80
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:22,490
Two is present simple.

81
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:28,880
Three is future, with ‘will’, and four
is past simple.

82
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,300
Inversions like this are more common written English,

83
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,160
but you might hear them in conversations, too.

84
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,300
Like all emphasis, you shouldn’t overuse
them.

85
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,240
You’re not coming to the party tonight,
right?

86
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,040
I *am* coming!

87
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,500
Why would you think I wasn’t?

88
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,660
Well, last time we went to their place, you
were in a terrible mood.

89
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,760
It didn’t look like you were enjoying yourself
at all.

90
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,500
Well, I was quite tired, but I *did* have
a good time.

91
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
OK, well that’s good.

92
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,280
I *do* hope you’re bringing Michelle with
you, too?

93
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,900
I haven’t seen her for ages.

94
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,500
Yes, she’ll be there.

95
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,800
Is she going to make her orange cake again?

96
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,200
That was the best!

97
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,600
I’ll ask her.

98
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,200
She *does* make the best cakes.

99
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,200
In the dialogue, you heard four examples of
adding emphasis by stressing an auxiliary verb.

100
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,100
Can you remember the sentences you heard?

101
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,200
Which auxiliary verb did they use?

102
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,200
You heard these four sentences.

103
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,200
One of these four is different from the others.

104
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,500
Can you see which sentence is different, and
why?

105
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,920
The sentence ‘I *am* coming’ is different.

106
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,800
It’s different because in the other three
sentences, you add an auxiliary verb for emphasis:

107
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
‘do’, ‘does’ or ‘did’.

108
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,480
Here, there’s already an auxiliary verb
– ‘am’ – and you simply pronounce

109
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,040
it with more stress.

110
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,800
If you have a sentence in the present simple
or past simple, and you want to add emphasis,

111
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,000
with most verbs you can add an auxiliary verb
‘do’, ‘does’ or ‘did’ to make

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,200
your idea sound stronger.

113
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,360
You need to pronounce the auxiliary verb with
stress, too.

114
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,000
Don’t say ‘I did have a good time’.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Say ‘I *did* have a good time.

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,900
In other verb tenses, there is already an
auxiliary verb.

117
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,200
For example: ‘I am going to tell her.’

118
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,900
‘They can speak Italian.’

119
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,600
‘You have grown a lot.’

120
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,599
To add emphasis to sentences like these, simply
pronounce the auxiliary verb with stress,

121
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,080
like this: ‘I *am* going to tell him.’

122
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,020
‘They *can* speak Italian.’

123
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,780
‘You *have* grown a lot.’

124
00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:01,000
Now, let’s look at one more way you can
add emphasis when you speak.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,420
Olivier, can you come downstairs, please?

126
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,430
What’s happened?

127
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,539
Look in the living room.

128
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:06,699
Did you break the TV?

129
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:08,729
I didn’t break the TV!

130
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,240
Well, what happened then?

131
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,249
It was the dog who did it!

132
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:16,560
He ran through the living room chasing the
cat and got caught on the wires.

133
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,900
OK, sorry, my mistake.

134
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,080
Look at a sentence you heard.

135
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,400
Here’s a question: why say it like this?

136
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:29,229
Why not just say ‘The dog did it’?

137
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:34,160
You can probably guess the answer: saying
it this way adds emphasis.

138
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,780
But, do you know what this sentence structure
is called?

139
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,979
It’s called a cleft sentence, also known
as a focusing sentence.

140
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:48,119
‘Cleft’ has a similar meaning to ‘split’
or ‘divided’.

141
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:52,550
In the sentence we used – ‘It was the
dog who did it’ – you can see that the

142
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,699
sentence is in two parts.

143
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:59,659
The first, ‘it was the dog’ and the second
‘who broke the TV’.

144
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:04,310
A cleft sentence will always have at least
two verbs: one in the first part, and one

145
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,900
in the second.

146
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,380
Cleft sentences often start with the word
‘it’, but they can also start in different

147
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,389
ways.

148
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:15,900
You can also start a cleft sentence with ‘what’
plus a clause.

149
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:23,300
For example ‘what I hate most about living
here is the dark winters.’

150
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,200
‘What I need right now is a good long holiday.’

151
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:34,160
‘What I’d like to do is put this aside
and think about it again after a good night’s

152
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,900
sleep.’

153
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,640
It’s also possible to make cleft sentences
starting with ‘all’, ‘something’ or

154
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
‘one thing’.

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,650
For example ‘All I want is to lie down.

156
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,660
I feel terrible!’

157
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,800
‘Something you should think about is choosing
the words you use more carefully.’

158
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:03,320
In the last sentence, you could also use ‘one
thing’, which is interchangeable with ‘something’.

159
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,120
There are other ways to form cleft sentences,
but these are the most common.

160
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,440
All these sentences follow the same pattern;
they’re divided into two parts, with at

161
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,280
least one verb in each part.

162
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,500
Thanks for watching.

163
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
See you next time!
