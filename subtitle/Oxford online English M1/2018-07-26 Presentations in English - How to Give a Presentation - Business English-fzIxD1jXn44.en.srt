1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,350
Hi, I’m Gina.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,150
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,930
In this lesson, you can learn how to make
a presentation in English.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,990
Do you have to make presentations in English
in your job?

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,820
Imagine you have to give an important presentation
in English tomorrow.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,440
How would you feel about it?

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,650
This lesson will help you learn useful phrases
and techniques to introduce yourself and your

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,580
topic, keep your ideas organised, deal with
problems, and respond to questions from audience

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,580
members.

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,430
Imagine you’re standing in front of your
colleagues.

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:42,300
You need to introduce yourself and what your
presentation is about.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,600
What are some words and phrases you could
use?

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,739
If some people in the audience don’t know
who you are, you should introduce yourself

14
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,809
and your position.

15
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,120
In a more formal setting, you could say something
like this:

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,399
Good morning everyone.

17
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,129
For those who don’t know me, my name’s
Simon, and I work in the marketing department.

18
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,920
Or: Hello everybody.

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,700
Before we begin, let me introduce myself briefly:
I’m Reese and I’m the head of HR.

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,180
If you work in a more informal company, you
could say:

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,100
Hi guys; if you don’t know me, I’m Sylvia
and I work in digital marketing.

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,960
Or: Hello!

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,990
I see some new faces, so I’ll introduce
myself first: I’m Julia and I’m one of

24
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,580
our customer service team.

25
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,150
Next, you need to introduce your topic.

26
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,840
If your presentation topic is simpler, you
could just say one sentence, like this:

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,580
Today, I’m going to be talking about our
new HR policies and how they affect you.

28
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:54,640
Or: I’d like to talk to you today about
quality control and why we’re all responsible

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,420
for quality control, whichever department
you work in.

30
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:06,310
If your topic is more complex, you might add
more detail to break your idea into stages.

31
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,200
For example:
I’ll begin by outlining the policies, and

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,160
then I’ll go on to highlight what they mean
for you and your working habits.

33
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:23,790
Finally, I’ll briefly discuss why we feel
these new policies are necessary and beneficial

34
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,160
for us all.

35
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,920
Here’s another example:
First of all, I’ll explain why ‘quality

36
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,580
control’ has a broader meaning than you
might expect.

37
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,690
I’ll continue by giving examples of real
quality control, and why this matters for

38
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,150
all of us.

39
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,550
To finish, I’ll be asking you to think of
ways you can incorporate quality control into

40
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,930
your working habits.

41
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,540
Here, you saw two examples.

42
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,080
You can use these as templates to begin your
presentation:

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,269
I’ll begin by… and then I’ll…

44
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:02,610
Finally, I’ll…

45
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,580
Or: First of all, I’ll…

46
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,510
I’ll continue by…

47
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,370
To finish, I’ll…

48
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,940
Okay, now you can practice!

49
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,050
We’d like you to do two things.

50
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:26,820
First, practice introducing yourself informally,
and explaining your topic in a simple way,

51
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,040
with one sentence.

52
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:37,560
Then, practice introducing yourself formally,
and explaining your topic in a more detailed

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,620
way.

54
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,110
Pause the video and practice speaking.

55
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,980
All the language you need is in this section.

56
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,280
Ready?

57
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,020
Let’s move on!

58
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:59,160
I’m sure that in your life, you’ve heard
good speakers and bad speakers.

59
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,569
Good speakers grab your attention and don’t
let go.

60
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:05,270
You want to hear what they have to say.

61
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,450
You feel interested and energised by listening
to them.

62
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,530
Bad speakers are the opposite.

63
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,790
Even if you try to make yourself listen, you
find that your attention drifts away.

64
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,689
Your eyelids feel heavy, and you have to struggle
to stay awake.

65
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:27,499
So, here’s a question: what’s the difference
between good speakers and bad speakers?

66
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:33,999
And, how can you make sure you speak effectively
when you make your presentation in English?

67
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:41,949
Here’s one way to think about it: bad speakers
don’t think they have to earn your attention.

68
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:48,240
Good speakers understand that no one has to
listen to them, so they work hard to make

69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,729
you want to pay attention.

70
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:57,479
What does this mean for you, and your presentation?

71
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,189
Getting people’s attention starts from the
beginning.

72
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:07,449
You need to make it clear what people should
expect from your presentation, and why they

73
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:11,600
should care about what you have to say.

74
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,110
Sounds like a nice idea, but how do you do
this?

75
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,650
Here are three techniques you can use.

76
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,770
One: establish a problem which many people
in your audience have.

77
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,689
Then, establish that you have a solution to
their problem.

78
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:30,499
For example:

79
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:36,080
Have you ever felt unfairly treated at work,
or felt that the work you do isn’t appreciated?

80
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,590
We’ve been working to design new HR policies
that will make sure all staff get fair recognition

81
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,539
for their contribution to the company.

82
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:51,649
In this way, you take a boring-sounding topic
like HR policies, and you make it more relevant

83
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:53,159
to your audience.

84
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,319
How?

85
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,669
By connecting it with their experiences and
feelings.

86
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,800
The second technique?

87
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,129
Mention an interesting fact, or a surprising
statistic to get people’s attention.

88
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:08,740
For example:

89
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:14,419
Did you know that the average office worker
spends eight hours a day at work, but only

90
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:18,439
does four hours of productive, useful work?

91
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:25,389
I’m here to tell you about ‘quality control’,
and how you can use this idea to make better

92
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,490
use of your time.

93
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:33,650
Finally, you can engage people by telling
a short story and connecting it to your topic.

94
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,999
Stories are powerful, and they can add an
emotional dimension to your topic if you do

95
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:39,610
it well.

96
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,490
For example:

97
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,199
I once met a young salesman—I won’t mention
his name.

98
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,909
He spent several weeks building a relationship
with a potential client.

99
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:53,890
He worked overtime, and he was working so
hard that he was under severe stress, which

100
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,580
started to affect his personal life.

101
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,099
In the end, he didn’t close the deal—the
clients signed with another firm.

102
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:06,289
Today, I’m going to talk about confidence
as a sales tool, and how you can avoid the

103
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:11,939
traps that this young man fell into.

104
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:16,059
Use one of these three techniques in your
introduction to connect with your audience

105
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:20,110
and show them why they should be interested
in what you have to say.

106
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:26,340
Here’s a question for you: which technique
would you prefer to use, and why?

107
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,869
Okay, now you’ve introduced your topic and
you have everyone’s attention.

108
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:35,660
What next?

109
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,419
There’s a famous quote about making presentations:

110
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:45,400
“Tell the audience what you’re going to
say; say it, and then tell them what you’ve

111
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,560
said.”

112
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,760
Have you heard this before?

113
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,749
Do you know who said it?

114
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:58,649
This comes from Dale Carnegie, a very successful
American salesman and writer.

115
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:03,800
He lived a long time ago, but his advice is
still relevant today.

116
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,919
So, here’s a question: what does the quote
mean?

117
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,750
It means that your presentation shouldn’t
just give information.

118
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,319
You also need to show people how your information
is organized.

119
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,489
To do this, you need signposting language.

120
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:25,270
Let me give you an example to explain.

121
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,399
Imagine you go to a website.

122
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:31,239
The website is full of really useful, interesting
information.

123
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:34,440
But, the information is all on one page.

124
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,930
There’s no organization, and you have to
scroll up and down, up and down this huge

125
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,250
page, trying to find what you need.

126
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,089
Would you stay on that website?

127
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:47,089
Probably not.

128
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:51,870
You’ll find a website which makes it easier
for you to find the information you need.

129
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,420
What’s the point here?

130
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:00,680
The point is that having interesting or relevant
information is not enough.

131
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,889
How you structure and organize your information
is equally important.

132
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:11,200
If you don’t structure your presentation
clearly, people won’t pay attention, just

133
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,490
like you won’t stay on a website if you
can’t find the information you want.

134
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,930
So, how can you do this?

135
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,620
You use signposting language.

136
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:31,240
This means using words and phrases to show
the audience where your points begin and end,

137
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:37,140
to show what’s coming next, and to remind
them about things you talked about before.

138
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,880
For example:

139
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,380
Okay, that covers the new policies.

140
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:47,140
Next, I’d like to move on and discuss what
these policies mean for you.

141
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:52,779
Or: Now that you’ve heard a bit about what
not to do, let’s focus on positive advice

142
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:58,430
to help you be more effective salespeople
and close more of your leads.

143
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,430
When you say something like this, you aren’t
giving people information about the topic

144
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,610
of your presentation.

145
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,460
Instead, you’re showing people where you
are, and where you’re going next.

146
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,259
It’s a kind of signpost.

147
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:15,970
You don’t need signposts to travel from
one place to another, but they can make it

148
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,800
easier.

149
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,180
What else can you use signposting language
for?

150
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:27,660
You can use signposting language to move from
one point to the next.

151
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,810
For example:

152
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:34,420
Next, I’d like to talk about…

153
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,560
Let’s move on and discuss…

154
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,640
Or: At this point, I’d like to turn to…

155
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,360
You can use signposting language to add detail
to an idea:

156
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,150
Let me go into some more detail about…

157
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,940
Let’s examine … in more depth.

158
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,640
Or: I’d like to elaborate on…

159
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:07,399
You can use signposting language to show that
you’ve finished your main points, and you’ve

160
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,939
reached your conclusion:

161
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:17,110
To wrap up, let’s remind ourselves of why
this should matter to everyone here.

162
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,300
Let’s review the key points from this session.

163
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,569
So, you’ve heard what I have to say.

164
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:30,370
What conclusions can you take away from this?

165
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:37,010
If you have an important presentation in English,
practice using signposting language.

166
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:43,769
Use signposting language to move between points,
to show when you’re giving a summary or

167
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:49,889
going into more detail, and to signal that
you’ve reached your conclusion.

168
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:56,480
Okay, but things don’t always go so smoothly
in real life.

169
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,040
We know that!

170
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:07,350
Let’s look at some advice and language for
dealing with problems during your presentation.

171
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,379
Imagine you’re making your presentation
in English.

172
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:11,810
What could go wrong?

173
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,470
What problems could you have?

174
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,139
There are many common problems:

175
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:21,889
You might forget where you were, or forget
an important word.

176
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:27,230
You might realise that you said something
wrong, or you didn’t explain something clearly.

177
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,560
You might forget to mention something important.

178
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,649
Or, someone might ask you an awkward question,
which you have no idea how to answer.

179
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:38,170
Of course, there are other possibilities!

180
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,850
Let’s think about these problems.

181
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:47,779
What can you do, and more importantly, what
can you say in these situations?

182
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:54,079
First of all, it’s a good idea to make a
cue card with key points, as well as any important

183
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,829
vocabulary you need.

184
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:01,879
If you lose your place, or you forget a word,
it could help.

185
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:05,430
However, you can’t prepare for everything.

186
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:12,269
So, it’s useful to learn some phrases to
deal with problems smoothly.

187
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:18,139
If you lose your place, and can’t remember
what to say next, you can use a filler phrase

188
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,600
like:

189
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,000
Where was I?

190
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,470
So, what was I saying?

191
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,639
What’s the word in English again?

192
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:35,160
If you still can’t remember, look at your
cue card with your main points.

193
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,149
Of course, forgetting something isn’t ideal.

194
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:47,670
But, if you do, it’s better to keep talking,
rather than just standing there in silence.

195
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:53,860
What if you make a mistake, or you realise
that you didn’t explain something well?

196
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,600
You could say:

197
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,449
Let me rephrase that.

198
00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:00,899
Actually, what I meant to say is…

199
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,480
To clarify, I wanted to say that…

200
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,610
In this way, you can correct yourself without
admitting that you made a mistake!

201
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,399
What if you realise that you forgot to mention
something important?

202
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,819
Use a phrase like this:

203
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:20,139
Let me just add one more thing:…

204
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:26,019
I’d like to add something to a point we
discussed earlier.

205
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:29,730
Let me return to an earlier point briefly.

206
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:36,499
Again, this allows you to correct your mistake
in a confident way, so you look like you’re

207
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:38,759
in control.

208
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:47,279
Finally, what do you do if someone asks you
a difficult question, which you can’t answer?

209
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,980
You have a few options.

210
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,980
First, you can delay giving an answer.

211
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,069
For example:

212
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:58,410
I’ve allocated time for questions at the
end of this session, so we’ll address your

213
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,990
idea later.

214
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,589
Or: I’m not in a position to answer that
right now, but I’ll get back to you later

215
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:06,580
this week.

216
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,899
This gives you time to think of an answer
and do some research if you have to!

217
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:18,290
Next, you can deflect the question, by asking
a question back, or maybe by asking other

218
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,520
audience members what they think.

219
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,639
For example:

220
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,329
That’s an interesting question.

221
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:30,330
Before I answer, I’d like to know: what’s
your take on this?

222
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,810
Or: You’ve raised an important point there.

223
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,500
What does everyone else think about this?

224
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,499
Finally, if the question is irrelevant, you
can dismiss the question and move on.

225
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:44,499
For example:

226
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:49,830
Thanks for your input, but I don’t see how
that’s connected to what I’m saying.

227
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:56,110
I don’t mean to be blunt, but I don’t
think that’s relevant to today’s discussion.

228
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:02,230
Notice how you can use phrases like thanks
for your input, but… or I don’t mean to

229
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:08,250
be blunt, but… to make your language more
indirect and polite.

230
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:15,000
So, for dealing with difficult questions,
just remember the three d’s: delay, deflect,

231
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,640
dismiss!

232
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:19,610
Finally, we want to ask you something.

233
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:25,709
Do you have any advice for giving good presentations,
in English or any language?

234
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:28,329
We’d love to hear your ideas!
