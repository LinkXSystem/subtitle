11
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,410
Let’s get back to our topic: small talk.

12
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:54,280
What exactly is small talk, anyway?

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,060
Hey.

14
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,440
Hi!

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,300
How’s life?

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,100
Pretty good.

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,080
You?

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,800
Not bad.

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,600
What’ve you been up to recently?

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh, not much.

21
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,059
I’ve been busy at work.

22
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:06,059
What about you?

23
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:07,059
What’s new?

24
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:09,820
Same, though I’m going away next month.

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,350
Really looking forward to it!

26
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,350
In the dialogue, you saw some basic small
talk.

27
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,720
Think about two questions: what is small talk?

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,620
Why is small talk important?

29
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,220
Small talk means that you make a simple conversation.

30
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,180
The topic isn’t important.

31
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,700
When you make small talk, you don’t give
many details.

32
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,690
You might ask questions like ‘How’s life?’,
‘What have you been up to recently?’ or

33
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,560
‘What’s new with you?’, but you don’t
expect a detailed answer.

34
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,720
Many people dislike small talk, or complain
about it.

35
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,360
They say that small talk is boring, or that
it’s pointless.

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,619
Small talk might be boring, but it’s not
supposed to be interesting.

37
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,750
That’s not its function.

38
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,400
Small talk definitely *isn’t* pointless.

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,640
So, what’s it for?

40
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,460
Small talk is a way to show friendliness and
interest.

41
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:14,240
What’s more, small talk shows that you and
the person you’re talking to are on the

42
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,940
same social level.

43
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:23,220
Think about it: managers don’t usually make
much small talk with their subordinates.

44
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,280
Teachers in schools don’t make a lot of
small talk with their pupils.

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,800
Police officers don’t make small talk with
criminals they arrest.

46
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,810
Why not?

47
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,380
It’s about hierarchy.

48
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,900
Managers are ‘above’ their subordinates
in the office hierarchy.

49
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:48,670
It’s the same for teachers and schoolchildren,
or police officers and criminals; they’re

50
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,000
on different social levels.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,010
If you meet a new colleague, or a new client,
or you start a new class and you want to make

52
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,330
friends, making small talk sends a social
signal.

53
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,989
It says, “We’re on the same level, so
we can be friendly with each other.”

54
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:12,970
Plus, small talk is a way to avoid silence
in conversation, which makes many people uncomfortable.

55
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,099
So, what should you remember from this?

56
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:23,250
When you make small talk, don’t worry about
the topic and don’t worry about being interesting.

57
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,140
That’s not the point of small talk.

58
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,290
Remember the three questions you saw before.

59
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,690
Can you remember them?

60
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,850
These are useful for making small talk.

61
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,590
Learn them and use them!

62
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:51,930
Next, let’s look at some common small talk
topics.

63
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,550
Are you from around here?

64
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,100
No, I grew up here, but I was born in Romania.

65
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,480
Really?

66
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,690
Are you from Bucharest?

67
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,970
No, from Timișoara, in the west.

68
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,400
I have to admit I haven’t heard of it!

69
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,440
That’s OK, most people haven’t.

70
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,900
It’s a big city in Romania, but it’s not
so well-known in other countries.

71
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,200
What’s it like?

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,160
It’s pretty, but there are more opportunities
here.

73
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,079
I’m planning to move back there in a few
years.

74
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,079
What about you?

75
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,079
Are you local?

76
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,630
Kind of.

77
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:29,180
I was born here, but when I was five my parents
moved to Mexico, and I grew up there.

78
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:35,720
I moved back here after I graduated, but I
haven’t spent that much time here.

79
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,340
Wow, Mexico!

80
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,920
Do you go back often?

81
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,520
Yeah, once or twice a year.

82
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,949
It’s quite far, but I still have some family
and a lot of friends there.

83
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:52,310
A common small talk topic is your hometown
and the place you live, or the places you

84
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,970
have lived.

85
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,220
To start a conversation, you could ask: ‘Where
are you from?’

86
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,500
‘Are you from around here?’

87
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,460
‘Are you local?’

88
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,060
If someone asked you these questions, how
would you answer?

89
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:18,190
You could say: ‘I was born in …, but I’ve been living
here for a while now.’

90
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:24,650
‘Yes, I was born here and I've lived here all my life'.

91
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:32,630
‘I’m originally from …’
When you find out where someone is from, you

92
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,850
can ask a follow-up question.

93
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,810
For example: ‘What’s your hometown like?’

94
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:45,590
With this question, it’s more natural to
use the name of the city, so say ‘What’s

95
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,650
Hangzhou like?’

96
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,430
‘What’s Quito like?’ and so on.

97
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,419
If the person you’re talking to is from
another city or country, you could ask ‘Do

98
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:58,030
you go back often?’

99
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:02,220
Remember: with small talk, keep your answers
short.

100
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,780
Give some information, but don’t go into
a lot of detail.

101
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:13,400
Also, try to find a balance between asking
questions and giving information about yourself.

102
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,020
Next, what other common small talk topics
can you think of?

103
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,090
Let’s look at another!

104
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,710
Any weekend plans?

105
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:29,320
Not much, I’m planning to play tennis on
Saturday, then maybe go out for dinner with

106
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,729
some friends.

107
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:31,729
You?

108
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:33,450
I’m having a quiet weekend.

109
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,370
That’s nice sometimes.

110
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,520
Actually, I prefer to get outdoors.

111
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,509
I do a lot of wild swimming, but it’s too
cold at the moment, so I’m going to be boring

112
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:44,580
and catch up on some housework.

113
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,090
Wild swimming?

114
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,300
You mean, swimming in lakes and rivers and
so on?

115
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,000
How did you get into that?

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,380
I used to be in a swimming club, and one of
my friends from there took me to a lake

117
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,060
where you can do wild swimming.

118
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,780
I started with short distances, and now I’m
training for a 10k.

119
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,319
Ten kilometres?

120
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,319
That’s crazy!

121
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,990
It’s like anything.

122
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,460
If you work towards it slowly, it’s quite
possible.

123
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,270
Have you ever tried it?

124
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,140
No, I’m not big on swimming.

125
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,830
I’ve done some long-distance running, which
I guess is similar in a way.

126
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,169
I wouldn’t know.

127
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:22,009
I hate running!

128
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:29,760
Talking about free time, hobbies and plans
for your days off is a common small talk topic.

129
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,880
Look at three questions you heard in the dialogue.

130
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,840
Can you remember the missing words?

131
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:46,000
Small talk is generally informal, so it’s
usual to ask short questions, like ‘Any

132
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:47,360
weekend plans?’

133
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:55,380
rather than full questions, like ‘Do you
have any plans for the weekend?’

134
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:01,900
If someone has an interesting or unusual hobby,
you could ask ‘How did you get into that?’

135
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,900
Could you explain what this means?

136
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,150
This question is asking: how did you become
interested in this?

137
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,039
How did you start?

138
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,320
You might answer with something like: ‘I’ve
been doing it for years.’

139
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,200
‘I got into it when I was a student.’

140
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,760
‘A friend took me one time, and I’ve been
hooked ever since!’

141
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:35,479
Finally, asking ‘have you ever tried it?’
is a good way to continue the conversation.

142
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,430
If the other person says ‘yes’, you have
more to talk about!

143
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:48,739
Let’s see one more common small talk topic.

144
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:50,449
How was your weekend?

145
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:51,449
It was nice.

146
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:53,279
My brother and his family came to stay.

147
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,459
Oh yeah?

148
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,840
So you have nephews and nieces?

149
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,380
Yeah, actually, I have ten.

150
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,180
Wow!

151
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,940
I had no idea.

152
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,660
How many of you are there?

153
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,240
Four.

154
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,600
Four boys; I’m the third.

155
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,540
You don’t have kids, right?

156
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,120
No, not yet.

157
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,220
You have one, or two?

158
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,220
Just one.

159
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:17,900
We’d like to have a second, but our apartment’s
so tiny it’s difficult to think about right

160
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,840
now.

161
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,639
What about the rest of your family?

162
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,790
Do you have any brothers and sisters?

163
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:27,500
I have one brother and one sister, and one
niece.

164
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,110
Nothing like your family.

165
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,100
It must be chaotic when you all get together.

166
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,690
Yeah, it is…

167
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,290
Fun, though!

168
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,230
First of all, be careful with asking people
about their families if you’re in another

169
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,720
country or another culture.

170
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,139
You don’t want to be oversensitive, but
in different cultures some questions might

171
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:48,910
sound too personal.

172
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,959
For example, asking ‘Are you married?’
or ‘Do you have children?’ to someone

173
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,340
you just met might be uncomfortable.

174
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,740
It’s difficult to say, because so much depends
on context.

175
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:07,949
Just think about it and remember that in different
cultures and countries people might have different

176
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:10,240
expectations!

177
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:17,079
Another tip: it’s good to wait for the other
person to mention their family before you

178
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:19,529
ask questions about it.

179
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:26,850
For example, in the dialogue, Oli mentioned
his brother, and I then asked him questions

180
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,320
about the rest of his family.

181
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,019
Anyhow, let’s see some useful small talk
questions to ask about someone’s family.

182
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,200
In the dialogue, you heard: ‘You have nephews
and nieces?’

183
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,720
‘How many of you are there?’

184
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,660
‘You don’t have kids, right?’

185
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,860
‘What about the rest of your family?’

186
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,149
Do you know how you would answer these?

187
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:01,850
In small talk, keeping the conversation going
is the most important thing.

188
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:07,910
It’s more important than what you talk about,
or what information you get from the other

189
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,269
person.

190
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:14,750
So, you might ask things which aren’t genuine
questions.

191
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:21,110
Actually, of these four questions, only one
is a real request for information.

192
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,240
Do you know which one?

193
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,540
The second is a real question, where you’re
asking for information.

194
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,129
What about the others?

195
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:38,379
The first and third are questions to check
information.

196
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:44,689
You use these when you think you know the
answer already, and you’re asking for confirmation.

197
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:51,059
You ask these questions to keep the conversation
moving, not because you need information.

198
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,860
The fourth question signals a small change
of topic.

199
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,939
In the dialogue, I used this question to switch
from asking about Lori’s immediate family

200
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:03,690
to talking about her family more generally.

201
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:08,709
In fact, in the dialogue, this question was
immediately followed by a second question:

202
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:12,460
‘Do you have any brothers or sisters?’

203
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:18,100
Now, let’s talk about one more thing.

204
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,120
Are you a football fan?

205
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:21,370
Not really.

206
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,829
I do like watching basketball, though.

207
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:24,829
Really?

208
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,600
I love basketball, too!

209
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,259
Do you go to many games, or just watch on
TV?

210
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:34,329
I go to, I guess, four or five games a season.

211
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:35,329
You?

212
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:36,619
About the same.

213
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:38,501
Did you see it last week?

214
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:40,009
That was a crazy result!

215
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,739
Yeah, I know, right?

216
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:43,899
Great game, though.

217
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,420
I couldn’t sleep afterwards, I was so hyped
up.

218
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,380
Do you think they have a chance of winning?

219
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,680
I’m not sure.

220
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,379
I don’t want to get my hopes up.

221
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:54,160
I know what you mean.

222
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,880
Hey, do you want to watch the game together
this Saturday?

223
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,300
I have some friends coming over to my house.

224
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:02,489
You could join us, and we’ll have beer
and snacks.

225
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:04,170
Oh, yeah, thanks!

226
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,170
That sounds great.

227
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:12,649
You heard before that small talk doesn’t
need to be interesting, and the most important

228
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:16,000
thing is to keep the conversation going.

229
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,220
That’s true, but what’s the end goal?

230
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,300
You can’t make small talk forever.

231
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,080
In the end, you need to develop a deeper conversation.

232
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:35,459
That doesn’t mean you need to get into serious
topics; when we say ‘deeper conversation’

233
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:41,379
we mean a conversation you’re both interested
in, and where you really want to hear what

234
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:44,379
the other person has to say.

235
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:49,079
The best way to do this is to find things
in common or shared interests.

236
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:54,339
To do this, balance asking questions and giving
information about yourself, and try to avoid

237
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:56,679
very short answers.

238
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:00,970
For example, in the dialogue, I asked Lori if she was a football fan.

239
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,209
She said that she wasn't.

240
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:08,129
Then, she added that she likes a different sport:
basketball.

241
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:13,519
This gave us something new to talk about,
and we found something we have in common.

242
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,120
If you just answer ‘not really’, then
it’s difficult to move the conversation

243
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,900
forwards.

244
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,060
Finally, a question.

245
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:28,200
Expectations and etiquette around small talk
can be very different in different parts of

246
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:30,319
the world.

247
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:36,249
Compare what you’ve heard in this lesson
to how things are in your country and your

248
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:37,629
culture.

249
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:43,820
Do you have a similar approach to small talk,
or are there differences?

250
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:49,880
Let us know your thoughts in the comments,
