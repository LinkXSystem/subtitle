1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,690
Hi, I’m Gina.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,540
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:11,491
In this lesson, you can learn how to do parts
one and two of the Cambridge B1 Preliminary

4
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:13,090
speaking exam.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,960
The B1 Preliminary exam is the new name for
the Cambridge PET exam.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,190
The new B1 Preliminary speaking test, which
was introduced in 2020, is similar to the

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,390
old PET speaking exam, but with some small
differences.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,579
If you need help to prepare for your B1 Preliminary
exam, or to improve your English generally,

14
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,019
right of your video player.

15
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:04,570
Or, if you’re watching on mobile, use the
settings icon, which is probably in the top

16
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,980
right of your screen.

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:16,320
Now, let’s see what happens in part one
of the Cambridge B1 Preliminary speaking exam.

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,890
In part one of the B1 speaking exam, the examiner
will ask you and your partner some basic questions.

19
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,240
You talk to the examiner.

20
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,890
You don’t talk to your partner in part one.

21
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,250
At the beginning of your speaking test, the
examiner will say: “Good morning.

22
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,140
Can I have your mark sheets, please?”

23
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,360
Then, the examiner will ask each of you: “What’s
your name?

24
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,420
Where do you live?”

25
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,460
Answer in *full sentences*.

26
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,140
Don’t just say “Gina.”

27
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,440
Say “My name is Gina.”

28
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,760
Don’t just say “Milan.”

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,770
Say “I come from Milan,” or, “I live
in Milan.”

30
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:06,590
After that, the examiner will ask each of
you “Do you work or are you a student?”

31
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:13,459
The examiner might ask extra questions, like
“What job do you do?” or “What subject

32
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:15,230
do you study?”

33
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,219
Here, try to add more information to your
answers.

34
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:22,180
Show the examiner what you can do in English!

35
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,260
For example, instead of saying “I’m an
accountant,” say “I’m an accountant.

36
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,769
I’ve been working in the accounting department
of a construction company for the last ten

37
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:33,400
years.”

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,200
Instead of saying “I’m at university,”
say “I study graphical design at the university

39
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,290
here in Bonn.

40
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,959
I’m in my second year, so I’ll graduate
in two years.”

41
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,609
Look at these two examples.

42
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:48,440
Do you notice anything?

43
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,489
They both use two different verb tenses.

44
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:54,959
The first example uses the present perfect.

45
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,409
The second example uses a future form, with
‘will’.

46
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:01,420
You should try to do this, too!

47
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:07,379
Say something about how long you’ve been
doing your job, or your course, or say something

48
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,510
about the future.

49
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,909
What about you?

50
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:15,650
How could you answer this question?

51
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,000
Try to make an answer now.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,110
Make one or two sentences, add details, and
use more than one verb tense.

53
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,410
Pause the video and say your answer out loud
now.

54
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,959
Could you do it?

55
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:38,140
If you need more practice, pause again and
repeat your answer several times, or try different

56
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,239
answers.

57
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,880
Next, the examiner will ask you and your partner
one or more questions.

58
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,151
These questions could be about different simple
topics, like your hometown, your family, your

59
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:54,439
home, your free time, your future plans, and
so on.

60
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:58,129
Look at some examples.

61
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:03,121
When you answer these questions, think about
the same points you saw before: add details

62
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:07,150
to your answer, and try to use a range of
language.

63
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:13,500
One point: what if you don’t understand
the question the examiner asks?

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,220
Just ask the examiner to repeat the question.

65
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,280
You can say ‘I’m sorry, could you repeat
that, please?’

66
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,960
Or, ‘Can you say that again, please?’

67
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,920
Don’t worry about having to ask this.

68
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,860
It’s normal, and it won’t affect your
score.

69
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,760
Let’s look at our example questions again.

70
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,560
Could you answer these?

71
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,970
Pause the video and try it now.

72
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,420
How did you do?

73
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,790
Now, let’s look together at some more ways
to improve your answers and your score.

74
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:57,970
First, like you heard before, try to use different
verb tenses if possible.

75
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,750
Look at a sample answer for the first question.

76
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,500
This is not bad, but you can always improve
your answers!

77
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,290
For example ‘On Saturday, I played tennis
with a friend, and then on Sunday I had lunch

78
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,440
with my family, which we do every week.’

79
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,880
You’re just adding a few words, but it all
helps to add detail to your answer, and it

80
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,500
helps your score, too.

81
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,760
Next, try to use a range of adjectives in
your answer.

82
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,960
Look at a sample answer for the second question.

83
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,650
Again, this answer is quite good!

84
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,060
But, again, it could be better.

85
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:47,340
Adjectives like ‘interesting’, ‘nice’
and ‘good’ are OK, but they’re general.

86
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,270
Try to use more specific adjectives and phrases.

87
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,770
For example ‘I live in Thessaloniki.

88
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:00,690
My town is a great place to live because it
has many excellent restaurants and some fascinating

89
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,270
museums.’

90
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:09,520
You can see here that you’re not just changing
the adjectives, you’re also adding words

91
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,600
to make the answer more descriptive.

92
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:21,440
You don’t just say ‘My town is nice’,
you say ‘My town is a great place to live’.

93
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,400
You don’t just say ‘good restaurants’,
you say ‘many excellent restaurants.'

94
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,150
OK, adding one word, like ‘many’, doesn’t
make a big difference.

95
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:39,460
But, it does make a small difference, and
if you do this all the way through your B1

96
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,800
speaking exam, it will count.

97
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,840
Now, let’s look at a sample answer for our
third question.

98
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,120
What do you think?

99
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,860
Good answer?

100
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,380
Again, it’s not bad, but it’s short; answers
like this don’t give you a chance to use

101
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,800
your English and show the examiners what you
can do.

102
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,400
Sometimes, students ask “What do I do if
I don’t know what to say?”

103
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,890
Firstly, you can make something up.

104
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,180
Your answer doesn’t need to be true.

105
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,370
You can say ‘I think I’ll live in New
York in the future.

106
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:21,600
After I finish university, I want to move
to Manhattan and work in the advertising industry.’

107
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,590
It doesn’t need to be true.

108
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,470
You can make up something interesting!

109
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:33,060
Secondly, even if you don’t know what to
say, you can still give some ideas.

110
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,030
For example ‘I don’t know where I’ll
live in the future.

111
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,800
I guess after I graduate, I’ll probably
stay here for a couple of years.

112
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,560
After that, I wouldn’t mind moving to another
city, or even another country if I can find

113
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,660
a good job there.’

114
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:58,310
In this way, you can turn a basic answer into
a full, interesting one, even if you’re

115
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,190
basically still saying ‘I don’t know’.

116
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:10,420
Now, let’s look at how to do part two of
the B1 preliminary speaking test.

117
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,980
In part two of the Cambridge B1 speaking exam,
the examiner will show you a photo.

118
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,770
You need to describe what you see in the photo.

119
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,430
You have one minute to talk.

120
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:26,030
At the start of part two, the examiner will
say: “Now I’d like each of you to talk

121
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,840
on your own about something.

122
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,020
I’m going to give each of you a photograph
and I’d like you to talk about it.”

123
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,379
In part two, you speak on your own.

124
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:40,459
When your partner speaks, you just listen,
or just relax for a minute.

125
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:44,649
There’s no connection between the two photos.

126
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,980
The examiner will give you an idea about the
topic of the photo.

127
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,629
For example, the examiner might say: “Here
is your photograph.

128
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:56,569
It shows people in a cafe.”

129
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,749
You don’t have any thinking time.

130
00:08:58,749 --> 00:09:02,689
You should try to start talking as fast as
you can.

131
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:05,860
So, how do you start?

132
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:11,390
First, give a general description of what
you see in the photo and what is happening.

133
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,760
Let’s look at a photo.

134
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,269
A common mistake which students make is focusing
too much on detail from the start.

135
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:25,160
For example, someone might say ‘In this
photo, there is some kind of computer or machine

136
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,640
on the left.’

137
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,480
That’s not wrong, but it’s not the best
way to start.

138
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,350
Start with a *general* description.

139
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:39,900
For example ‘In the photo, I can see a young
man who seems to be at the airport.’

140
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:45,740
After your general introduction, you need
to describe the photo in more detail.

141
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:51,379
When you describe the photo in detail, imagine
the examiner cannot see the photo.

142
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:57,050
Don’t use your finger and point to things
in the photo; use your words to describe what

143
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,800
you see.

144
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,680
How can you do this?

145
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:06,600
You need to use prepositions of place to say
what things are in the photo, and where they

146
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,340
are.

147
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,840
Look at another photo.

148
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,800
Here’s a challenge for you.

149
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,579
Can you use the preposition phrases you saw
before, and make at least three sentences

150
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:20,709
about this photo?

151
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:24,010
Pause the video and do it now.

152
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,390
Could you do it?

153
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,110
There are many possible answers, but here
are three examples: ‘In the bottom right,

154
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:35,520
there are some vegetables: broccoli, pepper
and cauliflower.’

155
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,720
‘On the left, there’s a man with his hand
over his mouth.’

156
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,779
‘At the bottom, there are two bowls, one
with carrots inside, and the other with courgettes.’

157
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:54,040
You can also use the phrases ‘at the front’,
‘at the back’ or ‘next to’ to talk

158
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,559
about where things are.

159
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,480
For example ‘At the back, there’s a shelf
with some containers.’

160
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,100
‘The woman is sitting next to the man and
holding a notepad.’

161
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:14,339
Review prepositions of place before your B1
preliminary speaking exam, and remember to

162
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:18,800
use them when describing the photo in part
two!

163
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,509
Sometimes students ask: “I don’t know
what to say!

164
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:23,780
How can I talk for a full minute?”

165
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,170
It’s not difficult.

166
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,449
Here’s why.

167
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:30,389
The photos almost always contain people.

168
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:34,629
That means you can describe the people, say
what they look like, what they’re wearing,

169
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,029
and what they’re doing.

170
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,879
This should give you lots of things to talk
about.

171
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,360
Look at another photo.

172
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,129
Think: what could you say about the people
in this photo?

173
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:51,709
Think about three questions: what do they
look like?

174
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,290
What are they wearing?

175
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,600
What are they doing?

176
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,080
Try it now!

177
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,139
Pause the video and say as much as you can.

178
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,139
Could you do it?

179
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:06,699
Let’s see an example.

180
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:08,930
On the left, there’s a small girl.

181
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:13,189
She looks like she’s about ten years old,
and she’s smiling and playing a game with

182
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:14,189
her parents.

183
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:18,779
She’s wearing a purple long-sleeved top,
and she has thick curly hair.

184
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,749
The girl’s parents are sitting next to her.

185
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:25,050
They’re also smiling and laughing while
they play the game.

186
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,399
The man has curly hair, like his daughter,
but the woman has straight hair.

187
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,629
We can’t see her full face, because her
hair is in the way.

188
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:37,209
She’s wearing a sleeveless turquoise blouse,
while the man’s wearing a blue shirt with

189
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:40,280
a white t-shirt underneath.

190
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,540
You see?

191
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,560
Just by looking at these simple details, you
can find lots to say.

192
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,830
Finally, you don’t just have to describe
what you see.

193
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:55,360
You can also give your opinions or make guesses
about things in the photo.

194
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,040
Look at one more photo.

195
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,420
What’s the woman doing?

196
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,899
Is she at home, or at work, or somewhere else?

197
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,780
Why?

198
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,140
What’s she doing there?

199
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:10,430
What about the man?

200
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,220
What’s he doing?

201
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,040
You might think: “I don’t know!

202
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,850
How should I know what she’s writing, or
why?”

203
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,740
But, you don’t need to know.

204
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,059
You can make guesses and give your opinions.

205
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:28,910
For example ‘In my opinion, they must work
for a company which makes things, maybe furniture.’

206
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,860
You can improve your answer by adding a reason,
like this.

207
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:39,420
In my opinion, they must work for a company
which makes things, maybe furniture, because

208
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,769
the man is working with some wood in the background.

209
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:48,730
You could also say ‘I think it’s a relaxed
place to work, because they’re both wearing

210
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,780
casual clothes’.

211
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,920
Or, ‘She’s talking on the phone.

212
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,269
Maybe she’s taking an order from a customer.’

213
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:03,910
You can also talk about what people are thinking
or feeling.

214
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,519
For example ‘She looks quite happy and relaxed.

215
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,540
I guess she enjoys her job and it’s not
too stressful.’

216
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:18,519
So, let’s review: start with a general description
of what you see, use prepositions of place

217
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,620
to say where things are, describe the people
you see, and then give your opinions about

218
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,220
what’s happening.

219
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,959
If you do these things, it should be easy
to talk for a minute!

220
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,980
Try to keep talking until the examiner stops
you.

221
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:37,800
Don’t worry if the examiner stops you, or
if you feel that you haven’t finished.

222
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,869
You don’t need to describe everything.

223
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:43,839
Just
keep talking, and the examiner will stop you

224
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,269
when your time is over.

225
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:47,850
Want more practice?

226
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,310
In this section, there are four photos.

227
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,269
Try to describe them.

228
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:56,899
Use a timer, and try to talk for a minute.

229
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:00,310
If you want, you can write your answers down,
and share them with other students in the

230
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,310
comments!

231
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,420
That’s it for this lesson.

232
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,149
Good luck if you have a B1 speaking exam coming
up soon.

233
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:07,149
Thanks for watching!

234
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:09,100
See you next time!
