00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,540
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,620
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,290
In this lesson, you can learn about the past
perfect verb form.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,960
What does the past perfect mean?

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,480
When do you need to use the past perfect?

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,369
How do you use the past perfect verb tense
correctly in a conversation?

7
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,380
You’ll see the answers to these questions
in this lesson.

8

Ready?

19
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:11,500
Let’s see how to use the past perfect verb
form.

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,700
How was the wedding?

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,090
A disaster!

22
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,250
I’ve never seen anything go so wrong.

23
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,299
Why?

24
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:20,299
What happened?

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,880
First, they had booked a hall for the ceremony,
but it was much too small.

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,380
Only 30 people could go in, and everyone else
had to wait outside.

27
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,300
Really?

28
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,240
That’s weird.

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,480
I know!

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,360
Surely they knew how many people they had
invited?

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,900
I guess not.

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,330
Sounds bad.

33
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,399
Yes, but that’s not all.

34
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,800
They’d booked a restaurant for the reception,
but they hadn’t told them how many people

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
were coming.

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,049
So, there wasn’t enough food, either!

37
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,260
That’s not good.

38
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:02,899
And then, as if that wasn’t enough, there
were so many long, boring speeches!

39
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:09,039
You could tell that no one had prepared their
speeches, and they were just trying to improvise.

40
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,990
It just went on and on.

41
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,030
So, you’re hungry and listening to boring
speeches for hours?

42
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,180
Doesn’t sound like much fun.

43
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,250
It wasn’t.

44
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,040
In the dialogue, you heard five examples of
the past perfect.

45
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,590
Can you remember them?

46
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,120
Here they are.

47
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,500
Pause the video to read if you need more time.

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,620
Think about two questions.

49
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,920
One: how do you form the past perfect?

50
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:49,900
Two: what’s the difference between the past
perfect and the past simple?

51
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,480
First, how do you form the past perfect?

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,489
You need ‘had’ or ‘hadn’t’ plus
a past participle.

53
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,440
For example, ‘had gone’, ‘hadn’t prepared’,
and so on.

54
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,470
‘Had’ can be contracted to apostrophe-d.

55
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:12,019
Be careful, because ‘would’ can also be
contracted to apostrophe-d.

56
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:17,440
In spoken language and in informal writing,
you should generally use contractions.

57
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,040
This is important, because if you don’t
use the contractions, you won’t hear them

58
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,849
when other people use them.

59
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,610
What about the second question?

60
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,090
What’s the difference between the past perfect
and the past simple?

61
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,269
To answer this, let’s look at an example
from the dialogue.

62
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:41,680
‘They had booked a hall for the ceremony,
but it was much too small.’

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,480
Here, you have the past perfect
and the past simple

64
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,569
in the same sentence.

65
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:52,790
Can you explain why?

66
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,349
In the dialogue, we were talking about two
different times in the past.

67
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:01,790
First, Kasia was telling me about a wedding
she went to.

68
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:08,200
But, she also talked about things which happened
– or didn’t happen – *before* the wedding.

69
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,780
She used the past simple to talk about the
wedding itself.

70
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,280
I used the past simple to ask questions.

71
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:21,540
For example:
I used the past perfect to talk about things

72
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,840
which happened *before* the wedding.

73
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,380
Look at the examples you saw before.

74
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:36,420
These are all things related to the preparations
for the wedding, which took place earlier.

75
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,840
So, that’s the basic idea.

76
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,300
You use the past perfect when you’re talking
about the past, and you need to talk about

77
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,470
something which happened – or didn’t – *before*
the time in the past which you’re talking

78
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,470
about.

79
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,040
Let’s look at this idea in more detail.

80
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,780
I’m going to tell you a story.

81
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,570
This happened to me when I was twelve years
old.

82
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:05,100
I was on holiday with my family, and we were
walking in a forest.

83
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,480
My Dad had told me that there were bears in
the forest, but I didn’t really take him

84
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,660
seriously.

85
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:18,600
I was walking in front; I turned a corner,
and… there was a bear!

86
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,860
I had never seen such a big animal in the
wild before.

87
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:29,540
I remembered something I had read about bears:
you should stay calm and try to move away

88
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,980
slowly.

89
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,500
So, I walked backwards, very slowly.

90
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,340
Luckily, the bear didn’t seem to care that
I was there.

91
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:46,280
Later, I felt scared, but at the same time I didn’t
feel anything – I guess because everything

92
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,030
happened so quickly.

93
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:58,730
When you tell a story, you need to talk about
several things that happened in a sequence.

94
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,360
For this, everything is simple.

95
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,200
Use the past simple if you’re talking about
things which happened one after another

96
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,750
For example: ‘I bought a new car.

97
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,190
I took it for a drive.

98
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,980
I crashed it into a tree.’

99
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:20,910
However, you might want to talk about things
which happened *before* the time of your story.

100
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,060
This is where you use the past perfect.

101
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,900
Look at the text of the story.

102
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,020
There are three examples of past perfect verbs.

103
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,810
Can you find them?

104
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:40,340
Pause the video if you want time to look.

105
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,020
Here are the three past perfect verbs.

106
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,800
They all refer to things which happened – or
didn’t happen – before the time of the

107
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
story.

108
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,280
So, this is a common reason to use the past
perfect: you’re telling a story, and you

109
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,080
need to refer back to times or events which
happened *before* the time of the story.

110
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:11,400
Next, let’s look at when you might need
the past perfect in an English conversation.

111
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,020
When did you start teaching?

112
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,410
Actually, it was kind of an accident.

113
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,200
It was 2005.

114
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,780
I had just graduated, and I wasn’t sure
what I wanted to do.

115
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,990
So, I took a six-month teaching job, mostly
because I wanted to live abroad and travel

116
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,340
a bit.

117
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,410
So, you didn’t want to teach?

118
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,700
Not really!

119
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,320
I had never considered it as a career.

120
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,460
Where did you move to?

121
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,600
Russia.

122
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,180
I had studied a little bit of Russian at university,
but not enough to really be able to do anything.

123
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:47,850
So, I wanted to learn more, and also just experience
living in Russia.

124
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,140
Had you ever lived abroad before?

125
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,140
Briefly.

126
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,660
I’d spent some time in Canada, but this
was more challenging.

127
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,900
In the dialogue, there were five examples
with the past perfect.

128
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,250
Did you hear them?

129
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,920
Remember: you can go back and listen to the
dialogue again if you want.

130
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:13,460
Often, when you have a conversation or tell
a story, you’ll see something which fixes

131
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,940
the time of the story.

132
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:22,620
In the dialogue, the first question fixes
the time: ‘When did you start teaching?’

133
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:29,520
In Oli’s answer, there’s a more specific
time reference: ‘in 2005’.

134
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,020
That means that the conversation is about
the time I started teaching: 2005.

135
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,330
But, we also mentioned things that happened
before that time.

136
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,530
Let’s practise this together.

137
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,280
Look at four sentences from the dialogue.

138
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:54,120
A question: do these things refer to 2005,
or before 2005?

139
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:02,140
Sentences two and three refer to the time
we were discussing: 2005, when he started

140
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,160
teaching.

141
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:12,760
Sentences one and four refer to an earlier
time, before 2005.

142
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:19,570
You use the past perfect to talk about things
which happened *before* the past time which

143
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,120
you’re talking about.

144
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,610
When you’re telling a story or having a
conversation, you might refer to several different

145
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,620
points, which happened at different times.

146
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,870
So, it’s common to jump between the past
simple and past perfect, like you saw in the

147
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,420
dialogue.

148
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:41,000
Here’s a good way to remember it: the past
perfect is the ‘past in the past’.

149
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,390
You use it when you’re already talking about
the past, and you want to refer to something

150
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,520
which is *further* in the past.

151
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,820
Many English learners understand these points,
but they still have difficulties using the

152
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,900
past perfect correctly.

153
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:01,880
In the next section, let’s see why that
is.

154
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,020
Were you late for work *again*?

155
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,060
Yeah…

156
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,220
What happened?

157
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,120
My alarm clock didn’t go off this morning.

158
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,340
So what time did you get there?

159
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,340
Around eleven.

160
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,350
Eleven?!

161
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,250
Why did you wake up so late?

162
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,980
I couldn’t fall asleep last night.

163
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,990
I probably got four hours of sleep.

164
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,490
Did you go to bed late?

165
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,070
Not really.

166
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,700
I think it was around twelve.

167
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,620
Did you hear the past perfect verb forms in
the dialogue?

168
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,620
Trick question!

169
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,460
There were no past perfect forms.

170
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,820
But, why not?

171
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,140
In the dialogue, we refer to different time
periods.

172
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,920
We start by talking about being late for work,
but then we talk about earlier time periods:

173
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,760
the morning when Kasia woke up, and the previous
evening.

174
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,820
So, again, why not use the past perfect?

175
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:06,171
There are places in the dialogue where it
is *possible* to use the past perfect, but

176
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:07,880
it’s better not to.

177
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:16,400
The most important point is that the order
of events, and when things happened, is clear.

178
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:22,100
For example, look at four lines from the dialogue.

179
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,920
You *could* say ‘Why had you woken up so
late?’, and ‘I had probably only got four

180
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:35,900
hours of sleep’, but it’s not necessary,
and it’s better not to – it sounds unnatural.

181
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,830
It’s not necessary because the order of
events is clear from the context.

182
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,370
Obviously, I woke up before I went to work.

183
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:50,040
Equally obviously, I was asleep before I woke
up.

184
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,620
When the order that things happened is clear,
you don’t need to use the past perfect.

185
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:02,820
Another point: using the past perfect is generally
less common in US English.

186
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:08,200
So, if you’re not sure whether to use the
past perfect or not, ask yourself whether

187
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,200
it’s necessary to make it clear what happened
when.

188
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,960
If not, use the past simple.

189
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,440
Sometimes, using the past perfect *is* necessary.

190
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,570
Let’s see an example.

191
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:26,680
Look at two sentences: ‘When I moved to
the USA, I found a job.’

192
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:32,070
‘When I moved to the USA, I had found a
job.’

193
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,080
These two sentences have different meanings.

194
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,540
What’s the difference?

195
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:45,630
The first sentence means you moved to the
USA first, and *then* you found a job, after

196
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,800
you moved.

197
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,960
The second sentence means you found a job
*before* you moved.

198
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:57,380
In this case, it’s important to use the
past perfect, because using the past simple

199
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,320
changes the meaning.

200
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,480
That’s all.

201
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,320
Thanks for watching!

202
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,110
See you next time!
