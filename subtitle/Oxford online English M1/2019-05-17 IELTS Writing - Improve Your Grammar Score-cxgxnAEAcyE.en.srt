00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,490
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,770
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,190
In this lesson, you can learn how to improve
your grammar for the IELTS writing exam.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:16,270
You’ll see exactly what resources you need
to improve your grammar score for IELTS writing.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,250
You’ll also get a practical plan which you
can follow.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,600
If you haven’t already seen our website,
then you should go and take a look!

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,820
We have free IELTS preparation lessons, and
you can also find a professional teacher who

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,370
can help you to prepare for your IELTS exam.

9
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,680
But now, you’re going to see a three-step
plan for working on your IELTS grammar.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,040
First, we want you to understand two things.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,320
One, do you know how IELTS grammar scores
work?

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,330
You can read the IELTS score scheme, which
is available online, but here’s a summary.

13
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:59,280
Your grammar score depends on two things:
range and accuracy.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,180
‘Range’ means the variety of sentence
patterns which you use.

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,630
If you only write in short, simple sentences,
or if you repeat the same sentence patterns,

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,939
you’ll get a lower score.

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:18,020
To get a higher score, you need to use a wide
range of sentence patterns.

18
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:24,100
Accuracy includes the quantity of mistakes
you make, where you make them, and whether

19
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,670
your mistakes affect communication or not.

20
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,570
What does this mean for IELTS scores?

21
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,400
If you only use simple sentence structures,
or if you make a large number of mistakes,

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,829
then you’ll get band five or lower for grammar.

23
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,479
If you try to use more complex sentence structures,
and if your meaning is clear in spite of your

24
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:53,710
mistakes, then you’ll get band six.

25
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:59,780
To get band seven, you need both good range
and good accuracy.

26
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:07,229
You need to use a wide range of sentence patterns
without making many mistakes.

27
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:16,090
Above band seven, it’s a question of degree:
you need wider range and better accuracy.

28
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,010
Our second important point before you see
your three-step study plan: you need the right

29
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,400
resources to practise.

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,730
You need: a good reference book, a source
of IELTS writing tasks, an understanding of

31
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,720
how to learn grammar in context, a memorisation
tool, and a source of feedback.

32
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,980
Let’s look at these one by one.

33
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,760
You need a good grammar reference book.

34
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,450
The best is the most popular: English Grammar
in Use by Raymond Murphy.

35
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,010
This is the intermediate version, which has
a blue cover.

36
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,190
The elementary and advanced versions are also
useful.

37
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,260
You need a source of IELTS writing tasks.

38
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,990
Cambridge publish books with past exam papers;
you can also type ‘IELTS writing tasks’

39
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:09,659
into Google or another search engine, and
you’ll find plenty of results.

40
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,450
You need to know how to learn grammar in context.

41
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:20,959
This means you need to learn grammar by understanding
and producing full, meaningful sentences.

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,360
We explained how to do this in another video,
which you should watch now if you haven’t

43
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,060
already.

44
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,500
You need a memorisation tool.

45
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:38,220
Language learning partly depends on memorisation,
and memorisation is often slow and inefficient.

46
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,540
We’ve also talked about this in other videos,
but the best solution is a digital flashcard

47
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:46,400
app such as Anki.

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,799
Invest some time and learn how to use Anki
or a similar tool, because this will save

49
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,890
you time and frustration later.

50
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,819
Finally, you need a source of feedback.

51
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:01,760
This probably means you need a professional
teacher.

52
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,080
I know many of you want to study independently,
but it’s extremely difficult to improve

53
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,189
your grammatical accuracy without feedback.

54
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:17,330
To put it simply: if you don’t know when
you make a mistake, then there’s no way

55
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,650
to correct it.

56
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:29,050
You need someone who can show you where you’re
making mistakes, and explain the reasons why.

57
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,340
Once you have these four things, you’re
ready to start with our three-step plan.

58
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,270
Let’s look at step one!

59
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,500
The IELTS scoring system differentiates simple
and complex sentences.

60
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,860
Here, ‘simple’ means that a sentence only
has one clause, with one main verb.

61
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:58,560
For example, these are simple sentences: ‘Fruit
is good for you.’

62
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,640
‘I am writing to ask for three days off
work next month.’

63
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,340
‘People from different cultures and backgrounds
can have very different attitudes towards

64
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,780
the role of marriage in a society.’

65
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,590
Note that ‘simple’ relates to sentence
structure, not length.

66
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,760
‘Simple’ sentences can be shorter or longer.

67
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:30,650
The important point is that simple sentences
have one and only one main verb.

68
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:37,419
In your IELTS writing exam, the first step
is to learn to write simple sentences accurately.

69
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,180
If you can’t do this, your grammar score
will be limited to band six maximum.

70
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,600
So, how can you practise this skill?

71
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,130
Find an IELTS writing task; write your answer,
but you need to follow some rules.

72
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,280
One: you can’t use any conjunctions.

73
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,560
That includes simple words like ‘and’,
‘but’, ‘so’, as well as subordinating

74
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,520
conjunctions like ‘although’ or ‘because’.

75
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,780
No conjunctions!

76
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,380
Two: you can’t use commas.

77
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:14,979
That doesn’t mean that you need commas but
you don’t use them, it means that you never

78
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,889
need a comma.

79
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:21,480
Commas in the greeting of general task one
are OK.

80
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,780
Three: you can’t use the words ‘that’,
‘than’, ‘which’ or ‘if’.

81
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,060
What’s the point of these rules?

82
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,600
Can you work it out?

83
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,080
The idea is to write your answer using *only*
simple sentences.

84
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,930
A common problem for IELTS students is that
they try to use complex sentence structures,

85
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,050
but they can’t write simple sentences accurately.

86
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,710
If you can’t form simple sentences without
making mistakes, then you can’t form more

87
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,620
complex sentences without making mistakes.

88
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:06,140
So, write your answer, and get feedback, for
example from a teacher.

89
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,880
See how many mistakes you make, and where
they are.

90
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
What next?

91
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,360
You’ll probably find that you made more
mistakes than you expected.

92
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,180
That’s fine; don’t worry about it.

93
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,600
Think about what you can do next.

94
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,889
First, you need to learn and practise any
grammar points which you don’t understand

95
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:26,289
well.

96
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:31,190
Look through your mistakes, or ask your teacher,
and see if you repeat similar mistakes.

97
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:37,490
Use your grammar book to read and do exercises
on any topics which are weak.

98
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,150
Secondly, you need to practise again.

99
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,199
Find a new IELTS writing task and write your
answer.

100
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,199
As a first step, aim to get 50% of your sentences
error-free.

101
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,780
That means zero errors, including small mistakes.

102
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:02,200
Once you can do this, aim to get 75% of your
sentences error-free.

103
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,300
Next, work on the total number of errors.

104
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:12,860
If 75% of your sentences are correct, and
you make a total of ten errors in the remaining

105
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:20,360
sentences, try to write an IELTS answer which
only has five errors total.

106
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,210
The exact numbers are flexible.

107
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:28,440
What’s important is that you set yourself
a target which represents progress for you.

108
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,320
If you make 50 mistakes in your first attempt,
then making 30 mistakes would be progress.

109
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,510
It depends on you and where you’re starting.

110
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,290
This step might take you a long time.

111
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:46,110
Although we’re talking about ‘simple’
sentences, you need a lot of grammar knowledge

112
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,180
to get through this.

113
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:54,250
You need to be able to use all common verb
tenses, modal verbs, prepositions, articles,

114
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,760
and more.

115
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,380
However, don’t be impatient!

116
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,480
This step is the foundation of your preparation.

117
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,140
Remember: if you can’t write simple sentences
accurately, then you can’t do anything more

118
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,990
complex.

119
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:15,149
If your target score is seven or higher, you
need to work on this step until you can do

120
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:18,000
it consistently.

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,060
When you can write an IELTS answer using only
simple sentences and without making many mistakes,

122
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:30,950
you’re ready to move on to step two.

123
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:36,660
At step two, you’re going to do the same
things, but the rules are different.

124
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,330
Here are some suggested rules: for step two:

125
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,610
One: you can use any coordinating conjunctions.

126
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:49,100
That means ‘and’, ‘but’, ‘so’
and ‘or’.

127
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,010
Two: you can use two or three subordinating
conjunctions.

128
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:59,700
We suggest you start with ‘because’, ‘although’
and ‘in order to’.

129
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,140
Three: you can use ‘when’, ‘if’ and
‘than’.

130
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,180
Just with these simple rules, your range is
now much wider.

131
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:15,329
You can now connect simple sentences using
coordinating conjunctions.

132
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:20,610
For example: ‘Social media allows us to
connect with others more easily, but it can

133
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,450
also lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.’

134
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,890
You can form complex sentences with subordinate
conjunctions.

135
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:36,010
For example: ‘Although social media does
not normally cost money to use, its numerous

136
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,760
disadvantages mean that it should not be considered
‘free.’’

137
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,060
You can make conditional sentences with ‘if’;
for example: ‘If social media is used responsibly

138
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,959
and moderately, it can be a great tool for
meeting new people.’

139
00:10:53,959 --> 00:11:00,050
You can also make comparatives, using ‘than’,
as in: ‘Some people argue that social media

140
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:06,380
has made face-to-face communication less important
than in the past, but I do not agree.’

141
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,800
So, you have more tools to use when writing.

142
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:16,540
However, your general task is the same: find
an IELTS writing task, write your answer,

143
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,640
and get feedback.

144
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,810
During this step, you need to make sure you’re
using ALL of the language in the rules.

145
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:31,140
We said in the rules that you *can* use these
things, but actually, you should try to use

146
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,810
every rule at least once.

147
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:40,430
That means that your answer should have *at
least* one sentence with a coordinating conjunction,

148
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:45,930
at least one sentence with a subordinating
conjunction, and at least one sentence with

149
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,100
‘when’, ‘if’ or ‘than’.

150
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,829
If you can do that, then set yourself a new
target: make two sentences for each rule,

151
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:58,389
then three sentences, and so on.

152
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:02,980
If you did the work on step one, then your
writing should be quite accurate.

153
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,389
However, you also need to think about accuracy.

154
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:14,820
Set yourself targets like you did in step
one; for example, aim to get over 75% of your

155
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:22,190
sentences error-free, or aim to make less
than ten errors in total.

156
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:29,260
The idea here is to start using more complex
sentence patterns, but in a controlled way.

157
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,279
There are still rules and limits, making it
easier to focus on accuracy.

158
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:40,829
However, your writing is hopefully now closer
to natural writing, with a wider range of

159
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:42,960
sentence forms.

160
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,260
During this step, you can be flexible with
the rules to make this easier or more difficult

161
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,420
for you.

162
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:54,910
If you find it difficult, then just use one
or two rules at the beginning.

163
00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:00,510
If you find this step easy, then you can make
the rules more complex, for example by using

164
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,959
a wider range of conjunctions.

165
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,149
You can also add more rules.

166
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:13,670
When you start doing this, you’re ready
for step three.

167
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:20,089
Step three is similar to step two, but you
need to add more rules, so that you need to

168
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:25,570
use a wider range of structures in each piece
of writing.

169
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:31,829
Remember that the rules are not just what
you *can* use; you *must* use each rule at

170
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:34,339
least once.

171
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:37,990
Here are some possible rules you could add:

172
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:43,730
Use a relative clause with ‘which’ or
‘that’.

173
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,420
Use a passive sentence.

174
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,800
Use a second conditional sentence.

175
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:58,260
Use a comparative with ‘as…as…’

176
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,279
These are just suggestions; there are other
possibilities!

177
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:09,600
Continue practising as before: find a task,
write your answer, and get feedback.

178
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,639
If you can write your answer with a high level
of accuracy, add another rule.

179
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:21,170
If your accuracy gets worse, then practise
with the same rules until you can write an

180
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,269
accurate answer.

181
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:28,140
You may need to work on specific grammar points
if you have weaknesses.

182
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:33,740
That’s the system; follow these steps and
your grammar will get stronger, and this will

183
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,750
improve your IELTS writing score.

184
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,220
We imagine it would be useful for your speaking
score, too.

185
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,660
However, we imagine some of you have questions
or objections, like: ‘How long will all

186
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,520
of this take?’

187
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,860
‘This seems like too much work!

188
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,720
Do I need to do all this?’

189
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,220
‘Do I really need a teacher to get feedback?’

190
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,750
To answer these: it will take a long time.

191
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:06,850
The exact amount of time depends on you, but
expect to spend several months working on

192
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,360
this.

193
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,680
Do you need to do all of these things?

194
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,280
It depends on your score target, and how much
time you have.

195
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,980
Here’s the key fact: if you can’t use
a wide range of sentence patterns, and if

196
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,649
you can’t write simple sentences accurately,
then you’ll struggle to get more than six

197
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:28,959
for your grammar score.

198
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,130
This is the exact situation which many of
the IELTS students we meet find themselves

199
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,700
in.

200
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,000
Finally, you need feedback from somewhere;
it’s essential.

201
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:46,100
Feedback can come from a teacher or from elsewhere,
but it’s difficult to get from other sources.

202
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,610
If your IELTS result is important to you,
then we recommend finding the best teacher

203
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,010
you can.

204
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:57,220
Without a teacher, your potential progress
will be much slower.

205
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,259
Do you have any other tips for improving your
grammar for IELTS writing?
