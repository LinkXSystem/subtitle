1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,600
Oh, hello.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,600
I'm Oli.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,960
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,600
Sorry, I'm just standing here.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,740
I'm drinking a cup of a strong Italian black
coffee.

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,740
Wait, is it black Italian strong coffee?

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,010
That doesn't sound right.

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,430
Italian black strong coffee?

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:31,189
Anyway, in this lesson you can learn how to
put adjectives in the right order.

10
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:35,440
Let's go back to the example I was having
so many problems with.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,809
You want to use the words "coffee," "black,"
"Italian," and "strong" all together.

12
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:45,149
They can go in many different orders.

13
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,539
Which is correct?

14
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:54,739
"Strong black Italian coffee," "Strong Italian
black coffee," "Black strong Italian coffee,"

15
00:00:54,739 --> 00:01:04,409
"Black Italian strong coffee," "Italian black
strong coffee," or "Italian strong black coffee?"

16
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:05,860
What do you think?

17
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,200
Is there only one possibility, or is there
more than one right answer?

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,640
Think about it.

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,820
There is only one possibility, "strong black
Italian coffee."

20
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,030
Do you know why this is the right answer?

21
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,540
In English when we use several adjectives
before a noun, the adjectives have to go in

22
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,340
a particular order.

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:36,310
Of course your meaning will still be clear
if you make a mistake with adjective order.

24
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,840
It's not a big problem.

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,750
However, it is very noticeable especially
to native speakers if someone makes a mistake

26
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,490
with adjective order.

27
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:50,860
So if you want your English to sound correct
and natural, you need to learn how to use

28
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,310
adjectives in the correct order.

29
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,820
Let's start with a simple rule that you can
use.

30
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,870
Rule number one: opinions go first, facts
go second.

31
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:08,580
The full rules for adjective order, which
you'll see in a minute, are complicated and

32
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,209
not very practical.

33
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:14,230
However, there is a simple rule which you
can use.

34
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,770
Adjectives which describe an opinion go before
adjectives which describe a fact.

35
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:28,400
For example, adjectives like 'nice', 'beautiful',
'useful', or 'delicious' all describe opinions.

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,050
Just because you describe something as delicious,
it doesn't mean that everybody will agree

37
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,000
with you.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,469
Adjectives like 'big', 'new', 'green', or
'silk' describe facts.

39
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:47,270
Take a second, try to think of some more adjectives
which describe opinions or facts.

40
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,389
Think about it.

41
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:55,940
Now let's see our rule in action with some
examples.

42
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,590
"They live in a beautiful old house on the
edge of the city."

43
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,110
"We had some delicious Korean food with some
friends."

44
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,859
"Why are you wearing those ugly purple trousers?"

45
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:17,010
"She has an interesting new perspective on
the economic situation."

46
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:23,159
In all of these sentences, we used two adjectives
before a noun, and you can see that the adjective

47
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,620
of opinion goes first and the adjective of
fact goes second.

48
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,000
Rule two: general ideas go before specific
ideas.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,560
There's another general rule which works well
if you don't know the correct word order.

50
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,709
Adjectives which describe a general idea go
before adjectives which describe a specific

51
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:46,709
idea.

52
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,969
For example, if you say, "A long wooden table."

53
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:52,980
The word 'long' is more general.

54
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,749
Many things can be long in many different
ways.

55
00:03:55,749 --> 00:04:00,780
A street can be long, a story, or a speech
can be long.

56
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,450
You can have a long day and so on.

57
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,459
'Wooden' is more specific.

58
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:12,329
Generally speaking, something can only be
wooden if it's actually made of wood.

59
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:17,250
So we put 'long' first and we say, "A long
wooden table."

60
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:24,480
Can you think of any other adjectives which
have a general meaning?

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,720
Adjectives like 'old', 'hot', or 'small' all
have a general meaning because they can be

62
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,170
used with many different meanings to describe
many different things.

63
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:40,960
On the other hand, adjectives like 'green',
'French' or 'straight' are more specific.

64
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,650
If something is green, that's quite a specific
idea.

65
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,250
Okay, let's see this rule in action with some
examples.

66
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,700
"He works for a small Canadian company."

67
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,120
"I love these old black-and-white films."

68
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,570
"We bought a new leather sofa for the living
room."

69
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,020
"I need to buy a really warm woolly hat."

70
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,930
Again, we used two adjectives with each noun.

71
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:17,030
In each case, the adjective with a more general
meaning goes first, and the adjective with

72
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,540
a more specific meaning goes second.

73
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,250
Okay, point three, let's look at the full
rule.

74
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,720
We said before that the full rule for adjective
order is quite complicated.

75
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,940
I'm showing you just for your interest.

76
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,810
Are you ready?

77
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:44,580
The full rule is: opinion, size, other qualities,
age, color or pattern, nationality and then

78
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,129
material.

79
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:47,680
Okay?

80
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,259
So we could say for example, "She bought a
beautiful long warm new black-and-white striped

81
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,580
Italian silk scarf."

82
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:09,680
We have opinion, 'beautiful'; the size, 'long';
another quality, 'warm'; an age, 'new'; a

83
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:19,030
color, 'black-and-white'; a pattern, 'striped';
nationality, 'Italian'; and the material,

84
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,030
'silk'.

85
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,169
So, do you need to know this rule?

86
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:23,479
No, not really.

87
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:26,720
First of all, it's too complicated.

88
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,639
You can't carry this around in your head and
use it when you speak.

89
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,759
Secondly, it's very rare that we use more
than two or three adjectives with a noun;

90
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,880
it almost never happens.

91
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,610
And three, native speakers don't always follow
these rules, especially when there are more

92
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,919
than two or three adjectives.

93
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:49,189
So it doesn't matter so much what you do in
those cases.

94
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:54,830
However, this doesn't mean that adjective
order doesn't matter, it does.

95
00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:02,090
If you make a mistake like, "She has black
straight short hair," this sounds a bit strange,

96
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:07,170
a bit wrong, and native speakers will hear
and notice mistakes like these.

97
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:12,639
Okay, part four, let's look at some advice
you can use, and let's review what we've talked

98
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,639
about.

99
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,659
Point one: trust your instinct.

100
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:18,289
If it sounds right, it probably is.

101
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:20,830
If it sounds wrong, it probably is.

102
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:28,280
Point two: remember the basic rules: general
before specific, opinion before fact.

103
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,870
These rules can help you in most of the situations
you will meet in everyday speaking.

104
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,099
That's the end of the lesson.

105
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:37,280
Thanks very much for watching.

106
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,349
I hope you found it useful.

107
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:41,979

113
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,300
Bye-bye!
