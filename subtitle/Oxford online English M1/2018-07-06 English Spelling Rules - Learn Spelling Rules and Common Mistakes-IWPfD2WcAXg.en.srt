00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,360
Hi, I’m Maria.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,590
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:11,990
In this lesson, you can learn about English
spelling rules, and see some of the most common

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,190
spelling mistakes that English learners make.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,289
English spelling is famously illogical.

6
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:21,710
Even native speakers commonly misspell words.

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,320
Interestingly, ‘misspell’ is a word which
is often misspelled!

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,150
In this lesson, you’ll see four of the most
useful rules that can help you to improve

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,410
your English spelling and avoid spelling mistakes.

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:41,490
You’ll also get to test your spelling skills
on several of the most common spelling mistakes

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,550
in English.

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:48,210
Let’s start with our first rule.

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,870
Look at five words.

14
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:55,740
Which are spelled correctly, and which 
have mistakes?

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,700
There are two mistakes.

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,140
Beginner should have two n's

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,480
and offering should have one r.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:12,600
Here’s a question: why do you need to double
the n in planning or beginning, but not the r

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,360
in offering?

20
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,780
Why does sitting have a double t, but deciding
just has one d?

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:26,630
Spelling mistakes with double consonants are
common, but you can avoid them if you remember

22
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,630
the rule.

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,670
Here it is:

24
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:36,250
If a word ends with a short vowel sound plus
a consonant, and the stress is on the last

25
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:45,170
syllable, then the final consonant is doubled
if you add an ending which starts with a vowel.

26
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,150
That sounds complicated, although it’s simpler
than it looks.

27
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,200
Let’s do some examples to make it clearer.

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,090
First of all, this rule applies to all one-syllable
words which end with a short vowel plus a

29
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,680
consonant.

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,440
For example,

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,760
hot -> hotter
jar -> jarring

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:14,460
sad -> saddest
cut -> cutting

33
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,600
win -> winner

34
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:23,050
Because of the way English spelling connects
to English pronunciation, you can think of

35
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:29,630
it like this: if a word has one syllable,
and it ends with one vowel and one consonant,

36
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,180
then you need to double the final consonant.

37
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,389
But, this depends on sounds, not spelling.

38
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:41,800
So, if the final consonant is w or y, don’t
double it:

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,240
draw -> drawing
grey -> greyer

40
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,560
Can you work out why this is?

41
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,540
It’s because the words are written with
a consonant, but the sound isn’t pronounced

42
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:59,260
as a consonant.

43
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:06,600
If a word ends with two consonants, or with
a consonant plus vowel, then don’t double

44
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,680
any consonants:

45
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:15,120
think -> thinking
write -> writer

46
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,620
If a word has two or more syllables, then
you also need to think about the stress.

47
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,549
If the stress is on the last syllable, and
the word ends with a short vowel plus a consonant,

48
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:33,120
then you need to double the final consonant;
for example:

49
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,440
occur -> occurring
commit -> committee

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,660
forget -> forgetting

51
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:50,920
However, if the stress is not on the last
syllable, you don’t double the final consonant;

52
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,740
for example:

53
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:59,000
happen -> happening
discover -> discoverer

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,040
water -> watery

55
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,879
Remember that for all these words, the rule
only applies if the word ends in a short vowel

56
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,900
plus one consonant.

57
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,269
This is true if you’re talking about words
with one, two, three or however many syllables.

58
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,280
Let’s do a quick test.

59
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,620
You’re going to hear a sentence.

60
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,050
Pause the video and write down the sentence.

61
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,940
You’ll hear it twice.

62
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,880
Ready?

63
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,470
The cooking committee happened to notice that
his soup was tastier than last year, but also

64
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,699
more watery.

65
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:42,990
Listen once more: the cooking committee happened
to notice that his soup was tastier than last

66
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,639
year, but also more watery.

67
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,520
Could you write down the sentence?

68
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,220
Let’s check:
Did you get everything right?

69
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,060
No spelling mistakes?

70
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,680
If so, that’s great!

71
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,660
Let’s move on to our next rule.

72
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,140
You're going to see four spelling mistakes.

73
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,000
Can you correct them?

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,920
The mistakes are all connected with i-e versus
e-i

75
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,360
There’s a well-known rule here: “i before
e except after c.”

76
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,120
That means that in most cases, i goes before
e:

77
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,060
piece
field

78
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:32,740
achieve

79
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,520
After the letter c, put e before i:

80
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,240
receipt
ceiling

81
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,680
conceive

82
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,159
But, there are exceptions.

83
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:52,220
One of the exceptions has its own rule: e
goes before i to make an /eɪ/ sound.

84
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,920
For example:

85
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,320
neighbour
weigh

86
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,909
eight

87
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:05,440
Other exceptions are true exceptions; they
don’t follow any rule and you need to remember

88
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
them.

89
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,340
Here are some of the most common exceptions
to this rule:

90
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,960
height
leisure

91
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,200
weird
caffeine

92
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,580
species
ancient

93
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,039
Let’s test your skills!

94
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:26,700
You’re going to hear another sentence.

95
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,580
Again, try to write the sentence down.

96
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,660
You’ll hear it twice.

97
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,050
Ready?

98
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,979
Her weird neighbour weighed out eight pieces
of ancient caffeine.

99
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:46,460
Her weird neighbour weighed out eight pieces
of ancient caffeine.

100
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,870
Here’s the answer:

101
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:54,550
Her weird neighbour weighed out eight pieces
of ancient caffeine.

102
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,499
Did you get everything right?

103
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,210
No spelling mistakes?

104
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,240
If so, well done!

105
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,039
If you made some mistakes, you can easily
go back and review this section, and then

106
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,560
try again.

107
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,280
Let’s look at our next rule

108
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,700
Here are five nouns.

109
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,740
What are the plurals, and how would you spell
them?

110
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,440
Do you know?

111
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,060
Here are the answers.

112
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:27,259
You can see that sometimes, you need to write
plurals with es.

113
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:35,930
But, when do you add -es to make a plural,
instead of just -s?

114
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,919
It depends on the last letter of the word.

115
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:49,020
If a word ends in -s, -ss, -z, -ch, -sh, or
-x, then you make the plural by adding -es.

116
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,740
For example:

117
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,219
glasses
buses

118
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:56,710
quizzes
beaches

119
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,200
dishes
boxes

120
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,580
Okay, but what about tomatoes?

121
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:09,319
That has a plural with -es, but it doesn’t
fit the rule you just saw.

122
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:15,370
There’s one more rule: if a word ends in
a consonant plus -o, then the plural is written

123
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,379
with -es.

124
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:18,759
For example:

125
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:21,340
potatoes
heroes

126
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,840
mosquitoes

127
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:33,060
However, if a word ends with a vowel plus
-o, then the plural is written only with -s,

128
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,420
like this:

129
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:38,540
videos
radios

130
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,950
All of these rules also apply when you add
-s to a verb.

131
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:50,310
As usual, there are some exceptions, although
most of them are uncommon words.

132
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:57,420
The most common exceptions to this rule are
logos and pianos.

133
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,140
Let’s do a quick test!

134
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,390
Here are five words.

135
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,110
How do you spell the plural?

136
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,560
Pause the video and write down your answers.

137
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,080
Ready?

138
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,940
Here are the answers.

139
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:21,900
Next, let’s look at one more useful rule
to improve your English spelling.

140
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,400
Listen to five words, and try to write them
down.

141
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,420
Ready?

142
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:37,180
Truly, changeable, surprising, measurable,
advancing.

143
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:49,180
Listen one more time: truly, changeable, surprising,
measurable, advancing.

144
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,230
Here are the words; did you spell them all
correctly?

145
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:59,720
This rule is about adding a suffix to a root
word which ends with -e.

146
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,090
For example, true ends with -e.

147
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:11,120
When you add the suffix -ly, the -e disappears.

148
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:19,220
Change also ends with -e, but when you add
the suffix -able¬, the -e doesn’t disappear.

149
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,320
Do you know why this is?

150
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,380
Whether the -e disappears or not depends on
two things: the spelling of the root word,

151
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,220
and the suffix you are adding.

152
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,650
Firstly, the -e can only disappear if you
add a suffix which starts with a vowel, like

153
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:44,720
-able, -ible, -ing, -ity or -ed.

154
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,280
For example:

155
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,380
achievable
taking

156
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,860
activity

157
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:58,070
However, if a word ends with -ue, then you
can sometimes drop the -e, even if the suffix

158
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,670
begins with a consonant.

159
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,630
For example:

160
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:09,180
truly
argument

161
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,960
Even when you’re using a suffix which starts
with a vowel, you don’t always drop the

162
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
-e.

163
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:23,690
If the word ends -ce and the ending has an
/s/ sound, or if a word ends -ge and the ending

164
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:30,010
has a /dʒ/ sound, then you might need to
keep the -e in order to keep the pronunciation

165
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,140
the same.

166
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,750
For example:

167
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,100
manageable
encouragement

168
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,500
graceful
unpronounceable

169
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,260
As always, these rules have exceptions.

170
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:56,210
Even if a word ends -ce or -ge, you still
drop the -e when you add an -ing suffix.

171
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:01,780
One important exception is the word ageing,
which can be spelled both ways: with an -e

172
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,180
(in British English) or without (in American
English).

173
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,690
Also, you don’t drop the -e if this would
change the pronunciation.

174
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:18,940
For example, the word agree needs to keep
two -e’s in order to keep its pronunciation:

175
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,200
agreeing
agreement

176
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,520
agreeable

177
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,850
Let’s do a quick test to see how well you
can use these rules!

178
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,950
Listen to five more words.

179
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,370
Write them down carefully.

180
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,460
You’ll hear the words twice.

181
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:44,060
Valuable, interchangeable, faking, seeing,
activity.

182
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:54,280
Valuable, interchangeable, faking, seeing,
activity.

183
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,530
Here are the answers.

184
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,600
How did you do?

185
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,360
Finally let’s look at some words which are
very commonly misspelled, even by native English

186
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,750
speakers.

187
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,230
Look at four words.

188
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:18,370
They all have spelling mistakes; can you correct
them?

189
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:24,130
Here are the four words; did you get them
all right?

190
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,000
What makes these words difficult to spell?

191
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,130
In words like accommodation, it’s difficult
to know where to put double letters.

192
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,450
What other words are like this?

193
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,360
How about committee.

194
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,690
How many -m’s?

195
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,610
How many -t’s?

196
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:48,130
What about embarrassed, millennium, possession,
correspondence, or harassment?

197
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:52,120
These are difficult because they aren’t
very consistent.

198
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,610
Why does embarrass have two -r’s, but harass
only has one?

199
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,060
It’s not logical; you have to remember them.

200
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:07,280
In words like conscious or guarantee, the
relationship between the spelling and the

201
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,260
pronunciation is strange, even by English
standards.

202
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:17,430
It’s rare that the letters ‘sci’ make
a /ʃ/ sound.

203
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:25,780
There are many words with the letters ‘sci’,
but normally, these letters make a /saɪ/

204
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:33,000
sound—like science—or a /sɪ/ sound—like
discipline.

205
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,280
It’s similar with guarantee.

206
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,240
Normally, the /g/ sound is produced by the
letters ‘ge’ or ‘gi’.

207
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,560
There’s only one other word family where
‘gua’ makes a /g/ sound.

208
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,380
Do you know which?

209
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,980
The word guard, and words made from it, like
guardian, are the only other words which behave

210
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,430
like this.

211
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:03,490
Again, these spellings are not consistent,
and you need to remember them as exceptions.

212
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,780
Finally, what’s the problem with independent?

213
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:15,730
This is difficult because there are two endings
which have the same pronunciation: A-N-C-E

214
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,340
and E-N-C-E.

215
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:28,340
So, you have audience with an ‘e’, but
ambulance with an ‘a’; competence with

216
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:39,140
‘e’, but clearance with ‘a’, interference
with ‘e’, but importance with ‘a’.

217
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,480
You can’t hear the difference between these
two endings.

218
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,380
Again, you have to remember the spellings.

219
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,760
However, it’s not all bad news: there is
some logic here.

220
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:56,120
Important is written with an ‘a’, so the
noun importance keeps the same spelling.

221
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,560
Interfere ends with an ‘e’, so again the
noun keeps the same spelling.

222
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:09,680
Now, we want to ask you something: which words
in English do you find most difficult to spell?
