1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,480
Hi, I’m Gina.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,680
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:15,040
Tomorrow, you have an important meeting, and
you’re the chair.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,700
It’s the first time you’re chairing a
meeting in English!

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,660
Think about this situation.

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:32,500
Would you know what to say to start the meeting,
present your main ideas, or summarise your

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,710
meeting agenda?

8
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:40,380
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to chair
a meeting in English.

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:51,850
You can learn useful English words and phrases
which you can use in your next meeting.

10
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,860
Now imagine: you’re in the meeting room.

11
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,230
You need to start the meeting.

12
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,110
What will you say?

13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:08,740
Part one: welcoming attendees and starting
the meeting.

14
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:16,780
Before the meeting starts, you have to make
sure that everyone is paying attention.

15
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,590
Do you know how to do this?

16
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,650
You could say:

17
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,790
If I could have your attention, please.

18
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:31,100
Could I have your attention, please?

19
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,630
Good afternoon, everyone.

20
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,979
You can also put two of these phrases together.

21
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,570
For example:

22
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:49,510
Good morning everyone, could I have your attention
please?

23
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:54,030
Remember, you’re the chair.

24
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,510
You need to take charge and lead the meeting.

25
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:04,590
Make a strong start to your meeting by using
emphasis in your voice.

26
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:16,080
For example, in the first phrase, we have
the word please after the pause at the end.

27
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,939
Emphasise the word please to sound firmer
and show people that you expect them to listen

28
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:26,299
to you.

29
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:27,359
Do it like this:

30
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:33,739
If I could have your attention, please.

31
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:36,129
You could also do this for the phrase:

32
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:42,680
Could I have your attention, please.

33
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,510
Listen to the phrase again.

34
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,260
When I say it, does it sound like a question?

35
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,189
Could I have your attention, please.

36
00:02:55,189 --> 00:03:00,890
The form is a question, but you can read it
like a statement.

37
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:07,739
This makes it sound firmer and shows people
that you need them to pay attention to you

38
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,659
now.

39
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:18,299
After you have everyone’s attention, it’s
time to welcome the attendees and get things

40
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,260
started.

41
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,809
Here are some good general phrases to use:

42
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:36,829
I’d like to welcome you all here today,
now let’s get down to business.

43
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:48,309
In this phrase, ‘get down to business’
means ‘begin discussing the important information.’

44
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:49,469
Thank you all for coming.

45
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:55,180
Perhaps we can make a start.

46
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,019
Thanks everyone and welcome to today’s meeting.

47
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:02,689
Let’s begin.

48
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:09,309
If this is your first time meeting these people,
you could also introduce yourself.

49
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:20,010
If there are other presenters in the meeting,
this is also the time to introduce them.

50
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,150
For example:

51
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:29,010
I’d like to welcome you all here today,
my name is Gina Mares and I’m the Marketing

52
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,670
Manager, and this is Jon and he’s the head
of the design department.

53
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,280
Now let’s get down to business.

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,540
Thank you all for coming.

55
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,600
My name’s Gina and I’m the Marketing Manager.

56
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,010
I’m sure you all know Dasha, who’s in
charge of web content.

57
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:56,810
Perhaps we can make a start.

58
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,510
Thanks everyone and welcome to today’s meeting.

59
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,830
I’m Gina Mares, the Marketing Manager.

60
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:11,290
This is Jess, from the accounts department,
and she’ll also be presenting today.

61
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,110
Let’s begin.

62
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:20,980
Next, we have to introduce the topic and talk
about the items on the agenda.

63
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:28,520
Part two: introducing the topic and outlining
the agenda.

64
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:36,600
After you’ve welcomed everyone to the meeting,
you want to make sure they have a clear idea

65
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,620
of what you’ll be discussing.

66
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:47,260
This can also help you to stay organized throughout
the meeting.

67
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:53,590
First, you want to introduce the overall topic
of the meeting.

68
00:05:53,590 --> 00:06:02,610
Then, introduce the agenda of the meeting:
all the key points you will be discussing.

69
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:12,440
Today’s meeting is about ... We’ll talk
about ...

70
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:23,850
The aim of this meeting is to ... We’ll
go over ...

71
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,801
When you go over something, what do you think
that means?

72
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:35,810
It means to analyze or look at something carefully.

73
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,650
You can also use cover.

74
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,330
For example:

75
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:54,120
In today’s meeting, we’ll go over ...
Or: In today’s meeting, we’ll cover ...

76
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,520
These are both useful when discussing an agenda.

77
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:06,200
Now, it’s your turn to practice beginning
a meeting.

78
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:15,640
Start with getting the attendees’ attention,
then welcome the attendees and get the meeting

79
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
started.

80
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:24,000
Finally, you can introduce the topic of the
meeting and outline your agenda.

81
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,700
I’ll give you an example, and then you can
create your own.

82
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,860
Good morning everyone, if I could have your
attention please.

83
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,050
I’d like to welcome you all to the meeting
today.

84
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,330
Let’s begin.

85
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:49,350
The aim of this meeting is to talk about the
marketing strategies for the next few months.

86
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:57,280
We’ll go over our budget, goals, and welcome
the new hires.

87
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
OK?

88
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,710
Now, it’s your turn.

89
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:08,330
Create an introduction for a meeting you’ve
recently had, or you can just use some general

90
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,430
topics from your job.

91
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,830
You can pause the video and think about it.

92
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,660
How did you do?

93
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:26,070
OK, now let’s move on to the main part of
the meeting.

94
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:32,410
Part three: getting through the agenda.

95
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:40,149
Now, you will get into the most important
part of the meeting: presenting your main

96
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:42,430
ideas.

97
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:50,000
How you do this depends on what you are talking
about, but there are some general rules that

98
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,790
you can always use.

99
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,520
You want to begin with the first item on your
agenda.

100
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,149
To do this, use phrases like:

101
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:13,730
So, let’s start with ...
The first item on the agenda is ...

102
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:20,620
After a phrase like this, you will present
and discuss the agenda item.

103
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,960
For example:

104
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:28,950
So, let’s start with some new business:
marketing strategies.

105
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:38,490
The first item on the agenda is how we can
make our online advertising more effective.

106
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:47,660
After you’ve discussed this first topic,
you need to let the attendees know that you’ve

107
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:53,190
finished and that the discussion should move
forward.

108
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,569
How can you do this?

109
00:09:54,569 --> 00:10:00,769
A simple closing statement will be good, such
as:

110
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:08,200
I think that covers the first, or second,
or third item.

111
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:16,600
If nobody has anything else to add, we can
continue on to the next item.

112
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,870
Now, you can move on to the next point.

113
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,480
Here are some useful phrases for this:

114
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:34,249
Let’s move on to the next item: …
Now we come to the…

115
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:42,110
The final item on the agenda is…

116
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:48,079
Using words like next or final can be very
helpful.

117
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,939
It helps everybody understand where you are
and what you’re doing.

118
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:59,100
Let’s see how to use these in some full
sentences:

119
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:06,499
Let’s move onto the next item: the marketing
budget for these new strategies.

120
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:15,519
Now we come to the main challenge: how to
get 100,000 new contacts in the next few months.

121
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:22,809
The final item on the agenda is to welcome
our new hires: James in Finance and Debra

122
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:27,709
in HR.

123
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:35,819
You can repeat these steps until you’ve
covered all of the items on your agenda.

124
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:37,760
Now it's your turn.

125
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,230
Imagine you’re chairing a meeting at your
company.

126
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,269
Write down three agenda items.

127
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:55,550
Practice using different English phrases to
introduce each item.

128
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:05,569
Again, you can pause the video and think about
the points we’ve just gone over, and also

129
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:09,019
practice making your own examples.

130
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:17,339
Next, we’re going to look at attendee participation
in the meeting.

131
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:23,199
Part four: inviting attendees to participate.

132
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:30,959
As chair, one of your responsibilities is
making sure attendees get a chance to express

133
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,410
their ideas and take part in discussions.

134
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,629
What can you say to bring others into the
discussion?

135
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,899
You could ask a question like:

136
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:51,930
..., what’s your opinion on this?

137
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,819
Would you like to share your thoughts on this
question?

138
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:59,519
Could you add anything to our ideas here?

139
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:07,990
These are good phrases to make sure all attendees
have a chance to participate.

140
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:18,420
Also, as a chair, you may have other attendees
who need to present ideas or lead the discussion

141
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,420
for part of the meeting.

142
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:30,410
When you want to hand over to another attendee,
you can use phrases like:

143
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,730
..., would you like to introduce this item?

144
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:41,449
I’d like to turn it over to ... who is going
to lead in the next point.

145
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:47,890
Alright, now ... will have the floor.

146
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:52,029
Just add the person’s name to use these
phrases.

147
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:54,769
For example:

148
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:59,980
Amit, would you like to introduce this item?

149
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,360
However, there could be a problem here.

150
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,050
What if some of the attendees talk too long,
or start going off-topic?

151
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:21,629
Part five: dealing with distractions and staying
on topic

152
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:26,089
Nobody likes meetings which go on too long,
right?

153
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:33,990
To be a good chair, you need to keep people
focused on the agenda and avoid distractions.

154
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:42,350
When someone is speaking for too long, there
are good, professional phrases that you can

155
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,600
use:

156
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,149
Let’s not get too far off-topic here.

157
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:55,619
We can discuss that at the end if you feel
it’s important.

158
00:14:55,619 --> 00:15:02,329
I don’t think that’s relevant to today’s
discussion.

159
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:09,800
If someone talks about a topic that would
be good to discuss at a later time, you can

160
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,160
use the phrase shelve it or table it.

161
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:22,750
This means you want to talk about it, but
in the future:

162
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,850
I think we should shelve that until next time.

163
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:33,549
Good point, but let’s table it until the
next meeting.

164
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:44,420
At this point, you’ve got through your agenda,
made sure that everyone has a chance to speak,

165
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,069
and stayed on topic.

166
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:47,199
Great!

167
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,290
But, you have one more job:

168
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:58,540
Part six: summarizing and concluding the meeting.

169
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,270
Once you’ve finished discussing everything,
you need to summarize your key points.

170
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,270
This will provide a conclusion to your meeting
and help people remember the most important

171
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,120
points from the agenda.

172
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,839
Here, you can say things like:

173
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:17,139
Before we close, let me just summarize the
main points.

174
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:20,079
To sum up…

175
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:28,199
In brief, ...
Shall I go over the main points?

176
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:39,970
Then, use verbs like discussed, went over,
and talked about to list the items from the

177
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,389
meeting.

178
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:43,389
For example:

179
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:51,819
To sum up, we discussed using the new internet
marketing strategies and cutting the budget

180
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:55,339
by $1,000 next month.

181
00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:01,679
We also talked about our new sales goals and
increasing our traffic.

182
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:07,250
Finally, we welcomed James and Debra to the
company.

183
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:13,190
Now, it’s time to finish up.

184
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:22,839
Here, you should show that you're finished
and ask for any final questions.

185
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:28,250
To finish, simple phrases like these are effective:

186
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:34,410
OK, it looks like we’ve covered the main
items for the meeting today.

187
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:40,430
Right, that’s all for today’s meeting.

188
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:46,540
Don't forget to ask if there are any final
questions from the attendees.

189
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:55,450
This will help them to clarify anything they
didn't understand and make any final points.

190
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,960
Is there any other business?

191
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:04,130
Are there any questions before we finish?

192
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:12,430
Now, I’d like you to practice concluding
a meeting.

193
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:19,520
First, I’ll give you an example and then
you can create your own:

194
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:28,260
To sum up, we discussed using the new internet
marketing strategies and cutting the budget

195
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,260
by $1,000 each month.

196
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:38,460
We also talked about our sales goals and increasing
our site traffic.

197
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,760
Finally, we welcomed James and Debra to the
company.

198
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,260
Right, that’s all for today’s meeting.

199
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,570
Are there any questions before we finish?

200
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,570
No?

201
00:18:51,570 --> 00:19:00,750
Great, I’d like to thank Bob, our CEO, for
coming here all the way from Beijing.

202
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,220
Thank you all for attending.

203
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,270
That’s all for today.

204
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:12,440
OK, your turn.

205
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:20,540
Summarize your meeting, thank everyone for
coming, and conclude.

206
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:27,970
Now you know how to chair a meeting from beginning
to end.

207
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,510
Are you chairing a meeting in English in the
near future?

208
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:40,940
I hope you can use some of the words and phrases
from the lesson to make it easier for you!

209
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:49,180
Each section has a lot of useful language
to learn and practice, so you might want to

210
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:55,480
go through some sections again to really get
comfortable with the language you need.

211
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,420
That’s all for this lesson.

212
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,010
Good luck, and thank you for watching!
