00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,190
Hi, I’m Lori.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,470
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:12,460
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to talk
about love and relationships in English.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:18,789
You’ll learn how to talk about dating, getting
engaged, good relationships, bad relationships

5
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:20,420
and break-ups.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,010
You can see lots of useful vocabulary used
in natural dialogues, and we’ll give you

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:31,400
explanations to help you use this language
clearly and naturally in your spoken English.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,050
Before we start, don’t forget to visit our
website: Oxford Online English dot com.

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,680
You can find free English lessons on many
topics, and you can also take online classes

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,309
with one of our many teachers.

11
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:52,600
For this lesson, let’s start by talking
about casual relationships and dating.

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,720
So, your friend Claire…

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,660
Yeah?

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,940
She seems nice…

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,620
Oh, you like her?

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,160
Yeah, I do.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,440
Aren’t you going out with that charity worker.

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,640
What’s her name again?

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
Georgia?

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,300
No, that’s over.

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,420
What happened?

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,700
I liked her.

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,860
Sometimes things just don’t work out.

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,620
Let me guess, she was too clingy?

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, how’d you know?

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,830
Everyone’s ‘too clingy’ for you.

27
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,850
Anyway, what about Claire?

28
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,920
Can you put me in touch?

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,420
Why don’t you just ask her out yourself?

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,870
I don’t have her number, or any way to contact her.

31
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,830
I think she’ll be at Sam’s housewarming
party on Saturday.

32
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,950
Maybe you should go.

33
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,860
Maybe I will!

34
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,860
If you’re single and you meet someone you
like, what’s the next step?

35
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,940
Of course, this is quite different in different
parts of the world!

36
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:50,070
However, in many places, you can ask the other
person on a date.

37
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,619
British and American English use different
words here.

38
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:59,640
In British English, you say ‘ask someone
out’ and ‘go out with someone’; in American

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,600
English, you say ‘ask someone on a date’
and ‘go on a date with someone.’

40
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,290
The meanings are the same.

41
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:14,030
‘Go out with’ and ‘date’—both verbs—can
also have the meaning that you’re seeing

42
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,440
someone regularly, as girlfriend or boyfriend.

43
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,599
However, it could also mean something less
serious.

44
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:32,740
For example, in the dialogue, you heard: ‘Aren’t
you going out with that charity worker?’

45
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,239
Here, ‘go out’ doesn’t clearly mean
that they’re in a couple.

46
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,809
It could also refer to a situation where two
people are meeting each other regularly, but

47
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:47,049
they aren’t a serious couple.

48
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:54,019
You could use this language in other ways;
for example: ‘They’ve been going out for

49
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,060
about a year now.’

50
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,680
‘She’s dating a guy I used to work with.’

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,900
In these examples, the context tells you that
you’re talking about more serious relationships.

52
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,870
However, in many cases you would use these
words—go out with someone, date someone—to

53
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,519
talk about couples in the early stages of
a relationship.

54
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,419
If two people have been in a relationship
for some time, you can use the term ‘be

55
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:24,419
together’.

56
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,720
For example: ‘How long have you and your
boyfriend been together?’

57
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,019
‘They were together for about four years,
but then they broke up.’

58
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:40,519
You can also use the verb ‘see’ to mean
‘have a relationship with someone’.

59
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,860
For example: ‘Are you seeing anyone at the
moment?’

60
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:54,420
‘I’m sure he’s seeing someone, but he
won’t tell me who it is.’

61
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,409
Like ‘go out with’ or ‘date’, these
sentences probably refer to the early stages

62
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:03,060
of a relationship.

63
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:12,180
If you’re going out with someone and everything’s
going well, what's next?

64
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,900
Did you hear Jen’s news?

65
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,180
No, what?

66
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,320
She’s engaged.

67
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,260
Really?

68
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,500
That’s great!

69
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,940
When did it happen?

70
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,220
A couple of weeks ago.

71
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,560
Phil proposed to her while they were on holiday
in Rome.

72
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,140
How romantic!

73
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,280
When’s the wedding?

74
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,900
I don’t think they’ve decided yet.

75
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:32,240
I’ll have to call her to say congratulations.

76
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,610
Did she have a ring?

77
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,610
Maybe.

78
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,090
I didn’t notice.

79
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,380
You’re useless!

80
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,960
Here’s a question: can you complete this
missing word from the dialogue?

81
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,490
It means: the situation before two people
get married.

82
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,530
The word is ‘engaged’.

83
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,189
Be careful with ‘get engaged’ and ‘be
engaged’.

84
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:59,740
Do you know the difference?

85
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,960
‘Get engaged’ is an action.

86
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:06,889
When you first agree to get married, you get
engaged.

87
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,520
After you get engaged, you *are* engaged.

88
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,400
‘Be engaged’ is a state.

89
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:21,620
For example: ‘They got engaged in June,
and got married in July.’

90
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,580
‘They’ve been engaged for two years now.

91
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:30,240
They say they’re too busy to plan a wedding!’

92
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,820
There’s a similar difference between ‘get
married’ and ‘be married’.

93
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,140
Next question!

94
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:42,380
Before you get engaged, one person has to
ask the other to get married.

95
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:48,230
Can you complete this sentence from the dialogue?

96
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,300
Do you remember?

97
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,860
The verb is ‘propose’.

98
00:05:52,860 --> 00:06:00,009
Colloquially, you can also say ‘pop the
question’ which has the same meaning.

99
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:06,500
For example: ‘He popped the question while
they were on holiday.’

100
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:13,100
This is conversational, so if you’re not
sure, use ‘propose’.

101
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,380
Let’s do two more.

102
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,479
Can you complete the sentences from the dialogue?

103
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,919
Do you remember the answers?

104
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,060
The full term is ‘engagement ring’.

105
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,140
However, in this context, it’s clear what
she meant.

106
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,980
Now, do you know any couples that have a really
good marriage?

107
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:43,100
That’s our next topic!

108
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,700
How long have you been married now?

109
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,560
Ooh…

110
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,980
Almost ten years.

111
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,300
That’s a long time!

112
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,460
No regrets?

113
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,640
No!

114
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,760
There are ups and downs, of course, but I
wouldn’t change it for anything.

115
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,430
You two seem like a really good couple.

116
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,650
Yeah, it works well.

117
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,620
Of course, part of being a good couple is
knowing when to give each other some space.

118
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,000
That’s true.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,610
I see a lot of couples who move in together,
and they give up all of the things which make

120
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,449
them individuals.

121
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:18,669
We spend a lot of time together, but we have
our own friends, our own hobbies, and so on.

122
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:22,280
Sure, I mean, you don’t want to be *too*
dependent on each other.

123
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,860
Absolutely.

124
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,999
Although, you need to strike a balance.

125
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:29,389
You need to make time for each other, too.

126
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:30,389
Of course.

127
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:34,479
I imagine that it can be easy to let things
slip when you’ve been together so long.

128
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,099
Yeah, it’s dangerous, actually.

129
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:42,629
You can’t take things for granted, otherwise
your relationship will suffer.

130
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:48,050
If two people go well together, you can say
they’re a good couple.

131
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:54,400
You could also say ‘a great couple’, or
‘a perfect couple’.

132
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,199
What do you think makes two people a good
couple?

133
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,919
In the dialogue, you heard these: ‘Part
of being a good couple is knowing when to

134
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,020
give each other some space.’

135
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,740
‘You need to make time for each other.

136
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:21,509
‘You can’t take things for granted, otherwise
your relationship will suffer.’

137
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:27,100
Do you know what ‘take things for granted’
means?

138
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:32,200
If you take something for granted, you’ve
had something for a long time and you get

139
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,490
used to it.

140
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,890
Then, you don’t appreciate it any more.

141
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,339
For example, imagine you eat in an amazing
restaurant.

142
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:43,659
The food is incredible, and you have a great
time.

143
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:48,800
Now, imagine you eat in the same restaurant
every night for a year.

144
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,900
Will you still appreciate it?

145
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,260
Probably not.

146
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,600
You’ll get bored of it, and it won’t be
special any more.

147
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,840
You’ll take it for granted.

148
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,100
What do you think?

149
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,920
Do you agree with these ideas?

150
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,820
Could you add any more suggestions for a successful
relationship?

151
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,440
Of course, there are many ideas!

152
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,540
Here are three more: ‘The most important
thing is to listen to each other.’

153
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:27,600
‘Accept that you’ll have ups and downs;
don’t expect everything to be perfect.’

154
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,750
‘If you’re unhappy about something, deal
with it quickly.

155
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,480
Don’t let things fester.’

156
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,810
‘Fester’ here means that you don’t deal
with a problem, so it becomes bigger and more

157
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,529
serious as time goes by.

158
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:48,510
Of course, not all relationships go perfectly.

159
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:55,779
Next, let’s see how you can talk about relationship
problems.

160
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:57,380
Have you seen Sasha lately?

161
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,730
Yeah, we met for a beer the other evening.

162
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,970
How’s he doing?

163
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,120
I haven’t seen him for ages.

164
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,600
Not so well.

165
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,260
It seems like he and Maria are having a difficult
time.

166
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,700
Really?

167
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,250
I remember seeing them together in the summer,
and they seemed like the perfect match.

168
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,120
I guess things have gone sour since
then.

169
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,480
From what he said, they aren’t getting on
well at all, so they’re fighting all the

170
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,400
time.

171
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,700
He didn’t seem happy.

172
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,529
What’s he going to do?

173
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:24,699
He wasn’t sure.

174
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:26,060
Do they live together?

175
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,060
Yeah.

176
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,620
That complicates things…

177
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,940
It does.

178
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,720
Maybe they’ll work things out.

179
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
You should call him.

180
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,139
He’d be glad to hear from you.

181
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:35,139
Mmm…

182
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,500
I’ll give him a call tonight.

183
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,970
Look at three sentences from the dialogue.

184
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,540
Can you explain what they mean?

185
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:53,050
If a couple are having a difficult time, it
means they’re having some relationship problems.

186
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,290
You can also say ‘have problems’.

187
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:03,020
For example: ‘He and Maria are having problems.’

188
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,400
‘Go sour’ is an idiom.

189
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:11,050
Here, it means that things were fine in the
past, but now they’re not.

190
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,340
Literally, ‘go sour’ is used with milk
and other dairy products.

191
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,750
If you keep milk for too long, it’ll go
sour, and then it smells bad and you shouldn’t

192
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,810
drink it.

193
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:27,840
Here, you’re using ‘go sour’ metaphorically.

194
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,930
Lastly, ‘they aren’t getting on well at
all’ means that they have a lot of conflict.

195
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:38,200
You might also say something like: ‘They’re
fighting all the time.’

196
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,720
‘They’re arguing a lot.’

197
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,440
‘They just aren’t seeing eye-to-eye at
the moment.’

198
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,930
‘Seeing eye-to-eye’ is another idiom.

199
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:56,899
If you see eye-to-eye with someone, you understand
each other and you have a good relationship.

200
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:03,880
You can use this in other contexts, not just
to talk about romantic relationships.

201
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:12,060
Finally, let’s talk about what happens when
relationships end.

202
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:14,490
Are we still doing movie night at yours tonight?

203
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,000
Ah…

204
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,840
Maybe not.

205
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,480
My friend Jon is staying.

206
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,449
It’s a bit of a messy situation—he left
his wife, and I think it’s for good.

207
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:23,540
Poor guy!

208
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,829
That must be tough.

209
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:27,230
Well… don’t feel too sorry for him.

210
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,829
He was cheating all over the place, and it
was his decision to walk out.

211
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:32,779
OK then, poor wife!

212
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:35,399
Soon to be ex-wife, I suppose…

213
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,399
Probably.

214
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,139
They’re that kind of couple, though: they
break up, get back together, break up again...

215
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:44,149
This time, though, I don’t see how they
can patch things up.

216
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:45,149
Yeah…

217
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:50,250
I don’t know them, but I don’t think I
could stay with someone who cheated on me.

218
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,920
It’s too big a betrayal.

219
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
I agree.

220
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,720
I guess it’s for them to deal with.

221
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,500
Anyway, can we do the
movie night at your house instead?

222
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,220
Please say yes; I’ve already told everyone
that it’s at your place.

223
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,760
Yeah, sure!

224
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,560
When you’re talking about the end of a relationship,
you need different words depending on whether

225
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:13,240
the couple you’re talking about is married
or not.

226
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,070
For an unmarried couple, you mostly use ‘break
up’.

227
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:23,540
‘Break up’ can be an intransitive verb—used
without an object—or you can break up *with*

228
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,540
someone.

229
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,600
For example: ‘They broke up about six months
ago.’

230
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,810
‘She broke up with him because he didn’t
seem serious enough about their relationship.’

231
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:42,839
For a married couple, you can use the verb
‘separate’, meaning that the two people

232
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:48,670
are still legally married, but they aren’t
in a relationship any more.

233
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:55,639
Then, you can use the phrases ‘get divorced’
and ‘be divorced’, in the same way as

234
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,310
you can use ‘get married’ and ‘be married’.

235
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:06,170
For example: ‘They’ve been living apart
for ages, and they finally got divorced last

236
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,680
year.’

237
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,500
‘She’s divorced.

238
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,660
She left her husband last year.’

239
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,230
You can also use the verb phrase ‘leave
someone’.

240
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:23,660
This is more common with married couples,
but you could use it for unmarried couples,

241
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,740
too.

242
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:34,709
Look at three more sentences which you heard
in this dialogue, and one from the last section.

243
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:39,120
Do you know what these sentences mean?

244
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,780
‘Work things out’ is a general phrase,
but if you’re talking about a relationship,

245
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:51,860
it means that two people find a way to solve
their problems, or at least to accept them.

246
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,709
‘Patch things up’ has the idea of repairing
or fixing something.

247
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:02,000
If a couple have a big fight, or if one person
does something bad to the other, they might

248
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,740
need to patch things up, meaning they try
to make things better again.

249
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,930
Some couples might break up, and then get
back together again.

250
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:17,350
You can use ‘get together’ to talk about
a couple starting a relationship, but ‘get

251
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,430
back together’ has a different meaning;
it means that two people are going back to

252
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,760
a relationship which ended previously.

253
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,620
That’s everything.

254
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,140
Thanks for watching!

255
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,060
See you next time!
