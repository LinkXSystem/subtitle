00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,250
Hi I'm Sam.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,310
Welcome to Oxford Online

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,310
English!

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,309
In this lesson, you can learn

5
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,690
what a vocabulary notebook is, why it's

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,440
useful for learning vocabulary more

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,360
quickly, and how to use it.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,020
Part one: why should you use a vocabulary

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,020
notebook.

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,490
A vocabulary notebook is a small

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,940
book where you can record new words.

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:29,940
The

13
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,640
best vocabulary notebook is small enough

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,929
to put in your pocket, so you can carry

15
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:40,050
it everywhere with you, like this.

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,819
Remembering new vocabulary is something

17
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:45,149
that many students find difficult.

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,149
To

19
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:47,680
really know a word means that you're able

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,719
not just to recognize it, but to use it

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,719
correctly.

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,350
But how can you go from

23
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,019
recognizing and understanding a word to

24
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:00,269
using it well in your English speaking

25
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,569
and writing?

26
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:04,659
You need to form a long-term

27
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:07,400
memory of the word or phrase you're

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,210
trying to remember.

29
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,510
When you learn new

30
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,870
words in class, or during self study, it's

31
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,520
in your short-term memory.

32
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,100
You're able to

33
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,230
recognize and even use the word during

34
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,010
your studies, and maybe even for a short

35
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,060
time afterwards, but then you may forget

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,060
it.

37
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,390
You need to move the word into your

38
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,590
long-term memory.

39
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,790
The only way to do this is to see, hear,

40
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,630
and use the word many times.

41
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,900
So then, why

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,130
is a vocabulary notebook helpful for

43
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,140
expanding your vocabulary more quickly?

44
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,870
A vocabulary notebook is an excellent tool

45
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,350
to help you move new words from your

46
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,590
short-term to your long-term memory.

47
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,590
You

48
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,440
can use it to record and review the

49
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,980
vocabulary, enabling you to see, hear and

50
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,420
use the vocabulary many times, which will

51
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,190
help you to remember it.

52
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,009
But how do you use avocabulary

53
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,009
notebook?

54
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:11,730
There are lots of different

55
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,840
ways to use a vocabulary network but

56
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,610
two things are important: record and review.

57
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,049
Part two: how to record the meaning of new

58
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:28,299
vocabulary.

59
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:30,819
Let's look at recording vocabulary.

60
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:31,819
When

61
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,150
you learn new vocabulary, record it

62
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,870
instantly.

63
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,540
That means write it down at

64
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,540
that moment.

65
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,140
The physical act of writing

66
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,389
it down can help you to remember it

67
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:44,420
later.

68
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,319
So, whether you're in class, studying at

69
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,459
home, or out and about, the best thing to

70
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,370
do is to record the word when you learn

71
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,519
it;

72
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,420
don't wait until later!

73
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,920
There are four

74
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
easy steps.

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,909
The first step is recording

76
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:04,359
words clearly and correctly.

77
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:05,870
This may

78
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,700
sound obvious but many students find

79
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,659
they're unable to read their own notes, or

80
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,549
they record and then learn words with incorrect

81
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:17,879
spelling.

82
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,620
So, always check how words are spelt.

83
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,620
So, what

84
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,870
else do you need to record?

85
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,129
The second

86
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,749
step is to record the meaning of the

87
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:29,919
vocabulary.

88
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,260
There are a number of ways to

89
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,260
do this depending on the word or phrase

90
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,090
that you want to learn.

91
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,209
Let's use our example, 'soup'.

92
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:42,209
Do you think

93
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:44,919
writing 'pea or chicken' will help you to

94
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,480
remember the meaning of this word?

95
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,480
It's

96
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,450
true that pea and chicken are examples of

97
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,330
soup, but writing down the meaning like

98
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,919
this might not help you to remember what

99
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,900
'soup' means.

100
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,040
However, I'm quite sure most

101
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,660
countries have soup, so translation is a

102
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,129
quick and clear way to show the meaning

103
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:09,129
of 'soup'.

104
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:11,120
I speak a little Turkish, so I'll

105
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,939
use that.

106
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:17,109
In Turkish, 'soup' is 'Ã§orba'

107
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:19,010
Many students also find that drawing

108
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,600
pictures helps them to remember words.

109
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Put the

110
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,890
picture on the right-hand page for

111
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,890
meaning.

112
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,530
For simple words like 'soup',

113
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,830
recording the translation your own

114
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,330
language is okay.

115
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,730
However, many words don't have a direct

116
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,730
translation.

117
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,620
For this reason it's usually

118
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,990
better to record the meaning in English.

119
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,290
But, use your own words; don't just copy

120
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,810
the meaning from the dictionary.

121
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,050
This will make it easier for you to

122
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,120
understand and remember the meaning.

123
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,290
Let's do an example.

124
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,161
Do you know the word

125
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,340
'tasty'?

126
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,840
It describes food that has a strong

127
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,220
taste or flavour.

128
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,440
We can also say that this is a positive

129
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,690
objective, similar to 'delicious', so we can

130
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,150
write a positive symbol next to the

131
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,150
meaning.

132
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,820
With adjectives, it's also a good

133
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,730
idea to record the opposite.

134
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,730
We can use

135
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,840
this sign for opposite.

136
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
The opposite of

137
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,200
'tasty' is 'tasteless'.

138
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,491
It describes food that

139
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:29,160
has no flavour.

140
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,680
This is a negative adjective, so we can

141
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,120
write a negative symbol next to the

142
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,550
meaning.

143
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,590
Hopefully, now you have a good idea of

144
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,000
how to record meaning in your notebook.

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,660
Using a vocabulary notebook is a

146
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,750
learning process, and should be personal

147
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,820
to you, so experiment with different

148
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,240
ways of recording meaning.

149
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,340
But, however you

150
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,290
decide to record meaning, one thing is

151
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,470
important: it must be clear to you when

152
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,560
you come back to it.

153
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,880
So, there are four

154
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,930
steps to recording vocabulary: first,

155
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,560
record the word clearly and correctly;

156
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,270
second: record the meaning.

157
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,150
What's next?

158
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:23,640
Part three: how to record the form of new
vocabulary.

159
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,960
Ask yourself or your teacher: is your

160
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:36,690
new vocabulary a noun, a verb, an adjective,
an idiom?

161
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,400
Remember that phrases

162
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,710
can be nouns or verbs too, so this is

163
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,830
true for both words and phrases.

164
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,510
If it's a noun, is it countable or uncountable?

165
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,900
Make a note so that you understand how to

166
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,650
use it.

167
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,110
You can record the form in

168
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,740
brackets next to the word.

169
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,740
Here,

170
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,680
'soup' is a noun, so you can write 'n' after

171
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,710
it.

172
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,530
'Soup' can be countable or uncountable.

173
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,530
You

174
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,850
can show this by writing C/U.

175
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:21,490
You can put adj. to show that 'tasty'

176
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,570
and 'tasteless' are adjectives.

177
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,180
It's helpful to use abbreviations to

178
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,180
record form.

179
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,330
Here are some examples.

180
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,250
n. is for noun.

181
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,730
v. is for verb.

182
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:45,840
C is for countable.

183
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,360
U is for uncountable.

184
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,620
adj. is for adjective

185
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,890
adv. is for adverb.

186
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:08,350
Capital 'I' capital 'D' is for idiom.

187
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:14,210
mwv means multi-word verb.

188
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,560
Abbreviations help you to record form

189
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,420
quickly and use less space in your

190
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,970
notebook.

191
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,610
So, when recording vocabulary,

192
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,770
you should: record it clearly and

193
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,310
correctly, record the meaning, record the

194
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,529
form.

195
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:36,080
There's one more thing you should record.

196
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,940
Part four: how to record the pronunciation

197
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,150
of new vocabulary.

198
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,099
You're learning

199
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,099
English.

200
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:46,450
That means you know how

201
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,340
confusing and irregular English

202
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,190
pronunciation can be.

203
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,780
That's why you

204
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,020
should record some details about the

205
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,340
pronunciation of words.

206
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,311
You could: write

207
00:09:00,311 --> 00:09:04,710
the sounds in phonetics, mark stressed

208
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:11,120
syllables, mark any silent syllables or

209
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,710
letters, and record any difficult or

210
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,690
irregular sounds.

211
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,400
For example, students sometimes confuse

212
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,960
the pronunciation of 'soup' with 'soap'.

213
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,230
So, the vowel sound here is important.

214
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:40,840
This is the symbol for the 'oo' sound.

215
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,200
You don't have to use phonetic symbols,

216
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,320
but they can help you to remember

217
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,800
the correct pronunciation of words.

218
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Vowel

219
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,840
sounds are a good place to start.

220
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
You can write

221
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,710
the 'oo' sound under the letters that

222
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,600
make that sound.

223
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,779
The word 'tasty' has more

224
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:07,010
than one syllable, so you should record

225
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,420
the stress in the word.

226
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,540
You can do this by underlining the vowel

227
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,420
where the stress is.

228
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,870
In 'tasty',

229
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,700
the stress is on 'a' Some students may

230
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,160
also find it helpful here to record the

231
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:31,390
vowel sound; the vowel sound is 'ay': tasty.

232
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,890
In

233
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:39,090
speech, the second t in 'tasteless' is

234
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,630
silent.

235
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,810
You can show this by writing a small

236
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:48,470
cross under the second 't': tasteless.

237
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,140
So, now we have the basic information we

238
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,840
need to record.

239
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,930
We've written the word

240
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,250
clearly and correctly, and we've checked

241
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,839
the spelling.

242
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,440
We've also recorded the meaning, the form

243
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,130
and the pronunciation of the words.

244
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,130
You

245
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,120
may notice that I've used different colours.

246
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,420
It's helpful to use colour in your notes,

247
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,060
and to be consistent.

248
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,130
That means always using the same colour

249
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,790
for the same thing.

250
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,790
You could use

251
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,360
different colours for different parts of

252
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,150
speech, as I've done here: my nouns are

253
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,890
black and my adjectives are red.

254
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,650
You could use different colours for verbs
and

255
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,950
adverbs, too.

256
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,830
This helps you understand and

257
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,190
remember the form of the word quickly.

258
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,480
Also, using a different colour for your

259
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,250
pronunciation notes helps them stand out.

260
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,250
I

261
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,320
always use green.

262
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,980
Finally, you might want to add some

263
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,590
information to your notes later, do

264
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,300
leave some space.

265
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,200
What else might you want to add?

266
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,230
You'll see

267
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,510
some ideas later.

268
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,750
Part five: remember

269
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,100
vocabulary by reviewing and developing

270
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,700
your notes.

271
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,480
So, now you know how to record

272
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,680
new vocabulary in your notebook, but

273
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,240
that's not enough.

274
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,200
You also need to be able to remember the

275
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
vocabulary.

276
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,940
When you're learning English,

277
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,490
you can forget around eighty percent of

278
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,710
your vocabulary if you don't review it.

279
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,830
Reviewing vocabulary means seeing it again
and

280
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,600
using it.

281
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,160
You don't need to spend a long

282
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,399
time each time you review.

283
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,399
The most

284
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,080
important thing is that you review it

285
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,500
many times over time.

286
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Carrying a

287
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,149
vocabulary notebook with you everywhere

288
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:58,850
helps you to do this.

289
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,180
Let's make a review

290
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,190
plan: imagine you recorded some

291
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,920
vocabulary in the notebook today.

292
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,529
How should you review it?

293
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:12,910
Research shows that students forget 80%

294
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,600
of what they've learned within 24 hours

295
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,410
of a lesson.

296
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,399
So, a short time after you've

297
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,460
written some new vocabulary down, take

298
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,360
five minutes to look at it again.

299
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
The

300
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,680
very best time to do this is 10 minutes

301
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,760
after, when you still remember most of

302
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,790
the lesson.

303
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,300
Maybe you're waiting for the

304
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,180
bus, or having a coffee.

305
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:44,520
You can take your notebook out and

306
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,790
review the vocabulary quickly.

307
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:53,060
Read through what you've written.

308
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,200
Remember the meaning, the form and the

309
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,230
pronunciation.

310
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:06,110
Say the words in your head: 'soup' is 'Ã§orba'.

311
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,250
Then, test yourself.

312
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,800
You can cover the meaning

313
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,870
site of the notebook, look at the words,

314
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,290
and see if you can remember the meaning.

315
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,459
Then you can cover the words on the left

316
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:25,670
side, and see if you can remember how to

317
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,680
say them by looking at the meaning:

318
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,270
'Ã§orba' is 'soup'.

319
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:39,270
Focus on the pronunciation: 'soup'.

320
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,310
Then, uncover the left

321
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,790
side and check the pronunciation and the

322
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,720
word.

323
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,680
Later that day, when you have a bit more

324
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,899
time, you can sit down and add some

325
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:57,140
information to your notes.

326
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,140
Firstly, you

327
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,880
should add collocations if you can find

328
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,030
them.

329
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,240
A good dictionary will give you

330
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,060
collocations.

331
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,060
Use an English learner's

332
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,890
dictionary such as Oxford, Cambridge, or

333
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,080
Macmillan to find the vocabulary.

334
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,290
What about collocations with 'soup'?

335
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,290
We

336
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,250
often use words the different types of

337
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,250
soup.

338
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:26,170
For example, 'chicken soup', 'potato

339
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,130
soup', 'tomato soup'.

340
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,340
We can also say, 'a

341
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:37,880
bowl of soup' or 'a tin of soup'.

342
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Write the

343
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,110
collocation in the space you left under

344
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,210
the vocabulary.

345
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,269
This will help you to remember the word

346
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:47,410
or phrase in the way that it's actually used.

347
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,480
Another good tip is to write sentences

348
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,430
using your new words.

349
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,430
The best way to do

350
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,240
this to help you remember your new

351
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,200
vocabulary is to personalize them.

352
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,320
For

353
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,450
example,

354
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:08,380
'My mum loves tomato soup, but I hate it.'

355
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,910
So, at the end of day one, you've found some

356
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,710
new vocabulary, you've recorded the

357
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,540
meaning, the form and the pronunciation.

358
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,269
You've reviewed it by looking at it again

359
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:24,480
as soon as possible after you first saw

360
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,480
it.

361
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,510
Then, you've reviewed it again by

362
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,519
looking it up in a dictionary and adding

363
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,700
collocations and a personalized sentence.

364
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,700
Congratulations!

365
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,700
You now have enough

366
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,110
information in your notebook to start

367
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,870
using it to really expand your

368
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,870
vocabulary.

369
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,180
I hope this lesson has helped you.

370
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,670

Thanks very much for watching!

374
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,730
See you next time.
