00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,920
Hi, I’m Lori.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,480
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,440
In this lesson, you can learn how to talk
about transport and driving in English.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,560
What’s the best way to get around your hometown?

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,610
Do you drive often?

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,110
What public
transport do you use regularly?

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:26,700
In this lesson, you’ll see how to answer
these questions—and many others—in clear,

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,039
correct English.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,780

English, English writing, or to prepare for

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,800
exams such as IELTS, FCE or CAE.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,720
But now, let’s see how you can talk about
getting around your city.

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,680
How do you usually get around?

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:15,039
I mostly use public transport, so I’ll take
the metro, or sometimes buses.

18
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:18,960
I have a car but I don’t use it much in
the city.

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
What about you?

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:26,240
I don’t have a car, so I either cycle or
walk most places.

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,670
Sometimes I take the metro or a taxi if I’m
going further, or if I’m out in the evening.

22
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,700
You cycle?

23
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,400
Here?

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,040
That’s brave!

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,939
There’s so much traffic.

26
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,070
It’s not that bad.

27
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,329
Once you know the best routes, you can get
anywhere in the city centre quite fast.

28
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:49,049
Often, it’s faster than driving, because
you can take small streets and you don’t

29
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,509
get stuck in traffic jams.

30
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,149
I guess…

31
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:55,240
I still wouldn’t do it, though.

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,780
The metro works well for me.

33
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,060
I can always get where I need, and I know
how long it’s going to take.

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,299
Yeah, the metro is good, but I hate taking
it during rush hour.

35
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,030
It’s so crowded.

36
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,420
Do you cycle to work every day, then?

37
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,940
Most days.

38
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,990
My office is actually very close, so I can
walk in about 20 minutes.

39
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,909
I walk in once or twice a week, and cycle
on the other days.

40
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:21,909
Wow!

41
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,489
That’s lucky.

42
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:26,680
It takes me at least 40 minutes to get to
work.

43
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,020
By metro?

44
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,099
Yeah.

45
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:34,400
I have to change lines, which adds a lot of
time.

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,080
Do you remember the question you heard at
the beginning of the dialogue?

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,290
Do you know what this means?

48
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:50,280
This question is asking about how you usually
travel around the place where you live.

49
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,870
How could you answer?

50
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:01,260
In the dialogue, you heard these phrases:
‘I mostly use public transport.’

51
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,560
‘I either cycle or walk most places.’

52
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,760
‘Sometimes I take the metro or a taxi.’

53
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,280
You could change these sentences to talk about
your own situation.

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,760
For example: ‘I mostly use the subway.’

55
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,100
‘I drive most places.’

56
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,250
‘Sometimes I use trams.’

57
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,360
With public transport, you can use the verbs
‘use’ or ‘take’, as in ‘use the

58
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,709
metro,’ ‘use buses’, or ‘take the
metro,’ ‘take buses.’

59
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,950
The meaning is the same.

60
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:48,200
If you’re talking about getting around by
car, bicycle, or on foot, then you can use

61
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,990
the specific verbs: ‘drive’, ‘cycle’
and ‘walk’.

62
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:58,100
For example: ‘I don’t drive often.’

63
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,340
‘I used to cycle, but I don’t have a bike
any more.’

64
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,500
‘I walk if I’m going somewhere in my neighbourhood.’

65
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:17,180
Next, let’s see how you can talk about public
transport where you live.

66
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,290
So, what’s the best way to get to your place?

67
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,290
Are you driving, or taking the metro?

68
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,440
I’ll come by metro, so I don’t have to
worry about parking.

69
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,300
You live on the green line, right?

70
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,540
Yeah.

71
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,920
So, you can take the green line to Victoria
in the centre.

72
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:39,610
From there, you can either change to the blue
line for two stops, or you can get a bus.

73
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,710
Which is better?

74
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,940
I’d take the bus.

75
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,700
It leaves you closer to my house.

76
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,250
Take bus number 27 and get off at October
Square.

77
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,530
It’s easy to find; it’s the first stop
after you cross the river.

78
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,020
Where does it leave from?

79
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,910
The bus stop is right outside the metro station.

80
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,350
You can’t miss it!

81
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,620
How often do the buses go?

82
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,820
They’re very regular.

83
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,330
I don’t know exactly, but I never wait more
than 10 minutes, and normally much less.

84
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,190
OK, I’ll do that then.

85
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,940
What time do the buses run until?

86
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,440
I’m just thinking about getting back.

87
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,130
The buses run until midnight, so you should
be fine.

88
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,990
The green line stops at one, right?

89
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,190
It’s a Friday, so it’ll run until two
o’clock.

90
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,260
I don’t think it’ll be a problem.

91
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,320
Great, so, see you tomorrow!

92
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,650
Here’s a question for you: what public transport
do you have in your hometown?

93
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,720
What do you use to get around?

94
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,560
Most cities have buses.

95
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,220
Big cities might have a metro or subway.

96
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,160
There are different words for this, because
many cities have their own name.

97
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,910
In New York and Tokyo, it’s the subway;
in Moscow and Paris, it’s the metro; in

98
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:03,810
London, it’s the Tube or the Underground;
in Berlin, it’s the U-Bahn, and so on.

99
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,560
All these words have the same meaning.

100
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,590
If you aren’t sure which to use, say ‘metro’
or ‘subway’.

101
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:21,400
Some cities have other kinds of public transport,
like trams, light rail, or shared taxis.

102
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,330
In many cities, you refer to metro lines by
their colour.

103
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,760
So, you might say: ‘I live on the green
line.’

104
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,460
‘Change to the blue line at Victoria.’

105
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:41,480
Buses have numbers, so you can say things
like: ‘Take bus number 27 and get off at

106
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,020
October Square.’

107
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,800
‘You can catch the number two bus from just
outside the metro station.’

108
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,780
If it’s clear what you’re talking about,
you might just use the number, and not say

109
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,020
the word ‘bus’ at all.

110
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:03,050
For example: ‘Take the number three for
five stops.’

111
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:09,280
In the dialogue, you heard these questions
about public transport: ‘Where does it leave

112
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,560
from?’

113
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,740
‘How often do the buses go?’

114
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,980
‘What time do the buses run until?’

115
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:27,900
Of course, you can use these questions for
other forms of transport, as in: ‘How often

116
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:35,420
do the trains go?’ or: ‘What time does
the subway run until?’

117
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,120
Do you remember how to answer these questions?

118
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,620
What could you say?

119
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,500
You might say: ‘It leaves from opposite
the shopping centre.’

120
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:54,040
‘There are trains every five minutes or
so.’

121
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,400
‘The metro stops at midnight.’

122
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,180
Now, it’s your turn!

123
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,720
Here’s a task for you.

124
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,390
Imagine that someone is coming to visit you.

125
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:11,150
Pick a place in your hometown, for example
the airport, train station or bus station.

126
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:17,140
Could you give clear directions in English
so that your friend can get to your home using

127
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,180
public transport?

128
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,550
Think about it.

129
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,580
Pause the video, and try saying your directions
out loud.

130
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:30,840
If you want to get really good, practise several
times, until you can say everything fluently,

131
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,340
without hesitation.

132
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,660
What’s next?

133
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:43,800
Let’s see how you can talk about driving
and car journeys in English.

134
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,870
Good to see you!

135
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,870
How was the drive?

136
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,750
It wasn’t too bad.

137
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,600
We got stuck in traffic near Birmingham, so
it was slow for a while, but everything else

138
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
was smooth.

139
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,180
It’s always bad around there.

140
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,620
How long did it take?

141
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,899
It was a bit over four hours.

142
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:02,389
That’s about average.

143
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:05,259
Your car looks very futuristic.

144
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:07,029
Is it electric or something?

145
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:09,310
No, it’s a hybrid.

146
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,310
Huh…

147
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,480
What’s it like to drive?

148
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,790
It’s nice!

149
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:18,220
It uses the battery at low speeds, so it’s
really quiet to drive in the city.

150
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,260
It’s also extremely efficient, which is
good for longer trips.

151
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,569
I’m thinking of getting a new car soon.

152
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:29,709
I’m still driving my old Subaru, but it
was second-hand when I bought it, and it’s

153
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:35,540
got over 200,000 kilometres on the clock,
so it’s starting to show its age.

154
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,680
It’s broken down three times this year already.

155
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,860
What are you thinking of getting?

156
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,430
I’m not sure.

157
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:49,589
Part of me wants to get a bigger car, like
an SUV or something, but then I know it’ll

158
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,720
be a nightmare to find parking, or driving
around the small streets in the centre.

159
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,320
Yeah, plus those things go through fuel.

160
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,120
They’re expensive to run.

161
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,800
Anyway, I’ll give it some thought.

162
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,069
Do you drive?

163
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:09,029
What kind of car do you have?

164
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:13,240
In the dialogue, you heard these sentences.

165
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,340
But, there’s a word missing in each sentence.

166
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,240
Can you remember the missing words?

167
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,870
Here are the answers.

168
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:30,959
Do you know what these phrases mean?

169
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,709
If you get stuck in traffic, you get in a
traffic jam.

170
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:39,660
‘Second-hand’ means the same as ‘used’.

171
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,860
If you’re buying a car, you can buy a new
car, or you can buy a second-hand car, which

172
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,579
has already been used.

173
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:53,029
Second-hand cars are generally much cheaper
than new cars.

174
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:59,310
If a car is efficient, it doesn’t use so
much petrol, so it’s cheaper to run.

175
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:05,180
Smaller cars and hybrids are generally more
efficient, while bigger cars, like SUVs, use

176
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,800
more petrol, so they’re less efficient.

177
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,680
If your car breaks down, it stops working.

178
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,310
Maybe there’s a problem with the engine,
and you can’t drive it.

179
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:24,060
Also, in the dialogue, you heard these questions.

180
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,060
We’re going to show you four answers.

181
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:31,490
You have a job; match the question to the
answer.

182
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,749
There’s one extra answer, which you don’t
need.

183
00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:39,800
Take a look!

184
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:46,060
Pause the video if you want more time to think
about your answers!

185
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,110
Ready?

186
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,840
Here are the answers.

187
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,580
Let’s look at one or two useful words here.

188
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,400
‘Smooth’ means ‘without problems’.

189
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:07,220
If you say ‘the journey was smooth’, you
mean that everything happened as you expected,

190
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,949
and you didn’t have any problems.

191
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:19,689
If a car goes through fuel, it uses a lot
of gas, so it’s inefficient and probably

192
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:23,420
expensive to run.

193
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:31,779
A ‘hybrid’ is a car which uses electrical
power at low speeds, and a gasoline engine—like

194
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,020
a regular car—at higher speeds.

195
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:42,399
Hybrids are quieter and can be more environmentally-friendly.

196
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,450
What about you?

197
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:50,050
If you drive, can you make two to three sentences
talking about your car, what kind of car it

198
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,660
is, and what you like or don’t like about
it.

199
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:59,899
If you don’t drive, make two to three sentences
about what car you’d like to have.

200
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:03,500
Use the language from the dialogue and this
section.

201
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,050
Remember: you can always go back and review
a section if you need to!

202
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:14,709
Pause the video, and make your answer now.

203
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:16,370
How was that?

204
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,400
Could you make a fluent answer?

205
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,080
If so, great!

206
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,980
Let’s look at one more point.

207
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,709
Are you doing anything?

208
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:30,730
We need to book flights for our trip.

209
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,879
Yeah… about that…

210
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,249
I had a look the other day.

211
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:36,009
They’re really expensive.

212
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:39,680
Actually, I was looking, too.

213
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,670
Direct flights are expensive, but I found
a couple of cheaper options.

214
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,860
The first choice is that we fly through Madrid.

215
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:54,699
We can also go through Oslo, which is much
cheaper, but there’s a seven-hour layover.

216
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:56,569
Seven hours?

217
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,329
What time would we get there?

218
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:01,470
About four in the morning the following day.

219
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,790
Eurgh…

220
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,339
What about the Madrid one?

221
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:05,339
Which airline is it?

222
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:11,399
We’d fly Greenjet into Madrid, and then
Prince Air for the second leg.

223
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,399
Greenjet?

224
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,399
No way!

225
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,839
I flew with them last year.

226
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,240
They charge you for everything, and the seats
are tiny.

227
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,939
Besides, we need to take at least one checked
bag, right?

228
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:24,040
I guess.

229
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,680
They charge 55 Euro if your bag is over 10kg.

230
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,809
Plus, they don’t serve food or drinks, or
even water.

231
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,089
You have to buy it.

232
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:35,089
Really?

233
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:36,290
That’s ridiculous!

234
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,970
Shall we take the Oslo route, then?

235
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:39,980
I suppose.

236
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,340
Why don’t we have one last look, to see
if we can find anything better?

237
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,180
Sure.

238
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,869
When was the last time you flew somewhere?

239
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:53,240
Where did you go?

240
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,040
In the dialogue, you heard these words and
phrases to talk about air travel.

241
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,850
Could you explain what they mean?

242
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,860
A direct flight means you take one flight
to your destination.

243
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:14,509
You don’t stop or change planes in another
city.

244
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:21,329
If you don’t fly direct, and you change
planes, you might have to wait in the airport.

245
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:26,460
This waiting time is called a layover.

246
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:32,820
A ‘checked bag’ is a bag or suitcase that
you check in, so that it flies in the hold

247
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,900
of the plane.

248
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:40,040
The opposite is hand baggage, meaning bags
which you carry with you.

249
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:47,279
In the dialogue, we talked about some of the
disadvantages of flying with a specific airline.

250
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,759
Do you remember what you heard?

251
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,260
You heard: ‘They charge you for everything.’

252
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,800
‘The seats are tiny.’

253
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,259
‘They don’t serve food or drinks.’

254
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:09,879
What do you think that first sentence means?

255
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:16,040
Many budget airlines offer cheap tickets,
but you have to pay for extras.

256
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:22,259
For example, you might have to pay to check
in a bag, or you might have to buy food and

257
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,220
drink on the plane.

258
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:32,490
‘They charge you for everything’ suggests
that this airline has a lot of extra charges,

259
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:37,000
which could make your ticket more expensive!

260
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,640
Of course, not all airlines are like this.

261
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:47,389
You could also talk about the advantages of
a certain airline.

262
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:53,620
For example, you could say: ‘The seats have
lots of legroom.’

263
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,440
‘Their staff are very helpful and polite.’

264
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,819
‘The food is pretty good.’

265
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:05,220
Can you guess what ‘legroom’ means?

266
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,030
It’s how much space you have for your legs
and feet.

267
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:15,020
If you’re tall, you need a seat with lots
of legroom.

268
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:21,640
Here’s a question: which airlines do you
think are the best or worst?

269
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:29,370
Can you think of two to three advantages or
disadvantages of the airline you chose?

270
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,790
Try to make two or three sentences, and say
them out loud.

271
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,090
Pause the video and do it now!

272
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,770
We have one final task for you.

273
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,710
How do you get around your hometown?

274
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:49,230
What are the advantages or disadvantages of
different forms of transport where you live?

275
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:56,920
Write a short answer, put it in the comments,
and we’ll give you some feedback and corrections.

276
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,620
Thanks for watching!

277
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,430
See you next time!
