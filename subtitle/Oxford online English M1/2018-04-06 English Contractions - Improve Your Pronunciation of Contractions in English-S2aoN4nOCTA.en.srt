00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:07,950
Hi, I’m Maria. Welcome to Oxford Online
English! In this lesson, you can learn about

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:15,129
the pronunciation of contractions. You’ll
see how to make contractions, how to pronounce

3
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:21,010
them, and when to use contractions in English.

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,090
What are contractions?

5
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,360
Contractions are when we put two words together
by making one word shorter.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,360
For example:

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:39,100
He is --> He’s
They will --> They’ll

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,530
Do not --> Don’t

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:49,000
But which words can you make contractions
from?

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,699
Here are the words that can make contractions
in English:

11
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:55,170
am,
are,

12
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,210
is,
will,

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,190
would,
have,

14
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,819
has,
had.

15
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:07,650
Let’s see an example in a sentence:

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,510
You are the nicest person I have ever met.

17
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,900
We can make two contractions here. Can you
see where?

18
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,080
You can contract you are to you’re, and
I have to I’ve.

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:30,390
You’re the nicest person I’ve ever met. The
pronunciation of contractions can change depending

20
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,510
on how fast you’re speaking. The pronunciation
can be quite clear and ‘textbook’:

21
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,890
You’re the nicest person I’ve met.

22
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,040
Or, the pronunciation can be faster and weaker:

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,120
You’re the nicest person I’ve met.

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,830
This fast, weak pronunciation is very common.

25
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,030
Let’s do another example:

26
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:59,660
They will think he has gone completely mad!

27
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:05,400
Can you see where we can make contractions?
Here’s the answer:

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:12,769
They’ll think he’s gone completely mad!
Many English learners find contractions with

29
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:15,450
will difficult to pronounce.

30
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,810
Let’s practice quickly: say they’ll.

31
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:31,459
As you pronounce the vowel, /eɪ/, slide your
tongue forward to add the /l/ sound.

32
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:38,849
They’ll They’ll Now, try the full sentence:

33
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:49,040
They’ll think he’s gone completely mad! Let’s
try one more time: they’ll think he’s

34
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:59,109
gone completely mad! Again, this time at natural
speed: they’ll think he’s gone completely

35
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:04,579
mad! Let’s do one more example:

36
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:09,560
I am sure she would call if anything had happened.

37
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Here, you can make three contractions. Can
you see them?

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,109
We can make contractions with am, would and
had:

39
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:28,969
I’m sure she’d call if anything’d happened.
Try saying the sentence. Let’s do it together,

40
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:41,760
slowly: I’m sure she’d call if anything’d
happened. Let’s try it once more, at natural

41
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:52,431
speed: I’m sure she’d call if anything’d
happened. Do you notice anything here? There

42
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:56,409
are two things which we need to pay attention
to.

43
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:03,139
Firstly, different words (had and would),
can have the same contraction: ‘d.

44
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:09,749
Secondly, the pronunciation of the ‘d contraction
is different in she’d and anything’d.

45
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,510
Do you know why?

46
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,740
Let’s find out!

47
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,300
Most contractions have two different pronunciations.

48
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:28,560
The only contractions which never change are
will and am. Contractions of will are always

49
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,380
pronounced ‘ll. Am is always ‘m.

50
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:42,550
Contractions of are, is, would, have, has
and had can have different pronunciations.

51
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:49,020
Why does the pronunciation change? It mostly
depends on the sound before the contraction.

52
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,270
Sometimes, it depends on the sound after the
contraction.

53
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:59,620
For would, have, and had, it depends whether
the sound before the contraction is a vowel

54
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,840
or a consonant.

55
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,920
The contraction of have is pronounced /v/
after a vowel sound:

56
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,860
I’ve,
we’ve,

57
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,830
they’ve.

58
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,630
After a consonant, the contraction of have
is pronounced /əv/:

59
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,930
could’ve,
would’ve,

60
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,080
might’ve.

61
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:31,770
The same rule is true for would and had. The
contraction is pronounced /d/ after a vowel,

62
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,830
and /əd/ after a consonant:

63
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,169
I’d,
she’d,

64
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,169
But:

65
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:41,349
it’d,
Tom’d.

66
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:47,389
There’s one exception to this: if someone’s
name ends with a vowel sound, we usually treat

67
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:52,460
it like a consonant for contractions. So,
if you want to say:

68
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:58,680
Sophie’d help you if you asked her.
Even though Sophie ends with a vowel sound,

69
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,819
we generally pronounce the contraction as
/əd/, because it’s a name.

70
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:11,610
Notice how I said ‘usually’ and ‘generally’?
It’s because this isn’t exactly a rule.

71
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:18,099
It’s more common, and I advise you to follow
it, but not all native speakers speak this

72
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:19,840
way all the time.

73
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,260
Next, let’s look at is and has.

74
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:30,360
The contraction of is and has is pronounced
/z/ after most sounds:

75
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,370
he’s,
there’s,

76
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,370
Dave’s.

77
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:43,729
However, after /t/, /p/, /k/, /f/ or /θ/,
the contraction of is or has is pronounced

78
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:46,080
/s/.

79
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,440
it’s,
Seth’s,

80
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,729
top’s.

81
00:06:51,729 --> 00:07:00,879
We don’t contract is or has after the sounds
/tʃ/, /ʃ/, /dʒ/, /ʒ/, /s/ or /z/, because

82
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,650
the contraction would be impossible to pronounce
clearly.

83
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:12,449
That leaves are. Are is a bit different, because
the pronunciation depends on the sound after,

84
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:15,270
not before. Look at an example:

85
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:20,450
We’re a good team.
We’re the best team.

86
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:26,889
Before a vowel sound, the contraction of are
has a /r/ sound. Before a consonant sound,

87
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:30,830
the contraction is pronounced as a schwa sound:
/ə/.

88
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,850
Now, you’ve seen common contractions and
how to pronounce them.

89
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:44,610
Next, let’s look at the pronunciation of
negative contractions.

90
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,719
If you have an auxiliary verb plus not, you
can put the words together and contract not

91
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,360
to n’t.

92
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,150
For example:

93
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,889
do not --> don’t
is not --> isn’t

94
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:05,940
have not --> haven’t
would not --> wouldn’t

95
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,000
This isn’t a full list.

96
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:13,389
There’s one which is a bit strange: will
not contracts to won’t.

97
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:20,860
Also, you can’t make a negative contraction
with am not. You can’t say amn’t. Why

98
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:28,439
not? I can’t even say amn’t. Saying amn’t
is really difficult. That’s why.

99
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:35,290
Let’s try a few examples. Look at this sentence.
Where can you make contractions?

100
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:40,599
He does not understand why they did not help
him.

101
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,880
We can contract this to:

102
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,190
He doesn’t understand why they didn’t
help him.

103
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:54,190
Let’s practice together. Say the sentence
after me, slowly: He doesn’t understand

104
00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:06,580
why they didn’t help him. Now, let’s try
again, at natural speed: He doesn’t understand

105
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:13,510
why they didn’t help him. Let’s do another:

106
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,930
They are not happy that the company has not
told them anything.

107
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,790
There are two contractions here. Can you see
them?

108
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:30,260
They aren’t happy that the company hasn’t
told them anything. Repeat the sentence after

109
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:42,790
me: They aren’t happy that the company hasn’t
told them anything. Try once more: They aren’t

110
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:49,300
happy that the company hasn’t told them
anything.

111
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,940
We’ll do one more example:

112
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,260
You should not have said yes if you could
not do it.

113
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,570
Where are the possible contractions here?

114
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,540
You shouldn’t have said yes if you couldn’t
do it.

115
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:17,520
Repeat the sentence after me: You shouldn’t
have said yes if you couldn’t do it.

116
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:29,020
Try once more: You shouldn’t have said yes if
you couldn’t do it. Sometimes with negative

117
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:34,480
contractions, there are two possible contractions.
For example:

118
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,370
They are not here yet.

119
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,710
You could contract this to:

120
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,899
They aren’t here yet.

121
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,120
Or:

122
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,410
They’re not here yet.

123
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:52,760
In most places, the first option is more common.
That means you contract not.

124
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,930
However, both are correct, and it doesn’t
matter which one you use.

125
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:04,480
So now you know how to form and pronounce
common contractions, but when should you use them?

126
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,300
Generally, you should use contractions when

127
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,800
you speak. Using contractions sounds more
natural in spoken English.

128
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,810
Look at an example from earlier:

129
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,350
He does not understand why they did not help
him.

130
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,570
If you’re speaking to someone, and you say
this sentence without the contractions, it

131
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:34,700
sounds a bit robotic and unnatural. Try it—say
the sentence out loud with no contractions.

132
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:42,470
Doesn’t it sound a bit strange?
Pronouncing the contractions makes it sound

133
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,990
much more natural:

134
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,410
He doesn’t understand why they didn’t
help him.

135
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:54,480
So, are there any cases where you shouldn’t
use contractions?

136
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,029
If you’re speaking more formally, you might
use fewer contractions.

137
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:05,779
If you want to emphasise something, you shouldn’t
use contractions. For example:

138
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:12,380
That is not what I said.
He is the best player.

139
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,889
I have called several times.

140
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:22,300
You need to use the full, uncontracted form
if you need to emphasise the verb or negative.

141
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:29,480
There’s one more case where you can’t
use contractions: don’t use positive contractions

142
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,279
at the end of a sentence or clause.

143
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,970
For example, if someone asks you:

144
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,300
Is he ready?

145
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,370
You should answer:

146
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,380
Yes, he is.

147
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,800
And not:

148
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,720
Yes, he’s.

149
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:50,120
However, negative contractions can go at the
end of a sentence or clause, so it’s fine

150
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,880
to say:

151
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,040
No, he isn’t.

152
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,029
What about written English?

153
00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:01,649
You can use contractions in informal writing;
you probably shouldn’t use contractions

154
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,029
in formal writing, like an essay.

155
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:12,630
Also, many contractions are used in speech
but not generally in writing. For example,

156
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,630
you can say:

157
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,730
These’re the chocolates that your friends’ve
sent us.

158
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,490
This’d be a good time to think about it.

159
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:28,199
Contractions like these’re, friends’ve
and this’d aren’t often used in written

160
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:32,910
English, even in very informal writing.

161
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:38,699
If you’re not sure if you can use a contraction
or not when you’re writing, then just use

162
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:40,470
the full form.

163
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,860
There are some more contractions like this,
which are common in spoken language, but which

164
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,540
aren’t written down.

165
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,820
Let’s take a look:

166
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,340
Here’s a sentence:

167
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,740
They would have enjoyed it, but they would
not have stayed long.

168
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,680
What contractions can you make here?

169
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:11,740
Well, would contracts to ‘d, and have contracts
to ‘ve. What does that give us? In the first

170
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,720
part, you should say:

171
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,340
They’d’ve enjoyed it…
Listen once more: They’d’ve enjoyed it...

172
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,340
Try one more time, a little faster: They’d’ve

173
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:33,290
enjoyed it… What about the second part of
the sentence?

174
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:39,310
Not contracts to n’t. Have contracts to
‘ve. So, you say:

175
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:46,069
…but they wouldn’t’ve stayed long.
Try saying the whole sentence with the contractions:

176
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:58,110
They’d’ve enjoyed it, but they wouldn’t’ve
stayed long. Try once more, at natural speed:

177
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:08,190
They’d’ve enjoyed it, but they wouldn’t’ve
stayed long. Do these contractions look weird?

178
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:13,000
If so, it’s because we almost never write
them.

179
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,660
What other contractions are like this?

180
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:21,600
You can contract did to ‘d in speaking,
but not in writing:

181
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,389
Why did you tell her? --> Why’d you tell
her?

182
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:32,300
When did you get here? --> When’d you get
here?

183
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,680
How did you like it? --> How’d you like
it?

184
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:44,100
You can contract will have to ‘ll’ve and
would have to ‘d’ve:

185
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,740
They will have left by now. --> They’ll’ve
left by now.

186
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:56,510
We would have been late anyway. --> We’d’ve
been late anyway.

187
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:02,959
You can contract not have after a modal verb
to n’t’ve:

188
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,980
They could not have helped. --> They couldn’t’ve
helped.

189
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:13,950
I would not have said anything. --> I wouldn’t’ve
said anything.

190
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:19,810
Remember: use these contractions when you
speak, but not in writing!
