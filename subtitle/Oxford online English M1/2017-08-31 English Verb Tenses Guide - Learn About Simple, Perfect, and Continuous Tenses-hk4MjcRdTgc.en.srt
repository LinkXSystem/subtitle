00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,660
Hi I'm Martin.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,830
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,160
In this lesson you can learn about English
verb tenses.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,600
Are you confused about your simple, perfect
and continuous tenses?

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,120
Do you know how many verb tenses there are
in English?

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,020
In this lesson, you can get a big picture
understanding of English verb tenses.

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,370
You’ll learn what connects English verb
forms, which will make it easier for you to

8
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,600
learn and understand verb tenses in English.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,200
Let's start with an overview of the topic
so that you understand what you're dealing

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,469
with.

11
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,010
Every English verb form has two parts.

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:54,280
The first part is the time: past, present
or future.

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:04,780
The second part is the aspect: simple, continuous,
perfect, or perfect continuous.

14
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:10,159
So, there are three times and four aspects.

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,320
You can combine these in twelve different
ways.

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,560
Pause the video if you want more time to look
at the table.

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,460
Let’s do a quick test.

18
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:28,590
Can you recognise these three verb forms?

19
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,710
I was having dinner this time yesterday.

20
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,710
He’s been sitting there for hours.

21
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,909
Where will you be next week?

22
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,660
Do you know the answers?

23
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,130
Let’s check!

24
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:52,289
In the first sentence, the time is past, and
the aspect is continuous: it’s past continuous.

25
00:01:52,289 --> 00:02:00,310
In the second sentence, the time is present,
and the aspect is perfect continuous: it’s

26
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,570
present perfect continuous.

27
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:13,410
In the third sentence, the time is future,
and the aspect is simple: it’s future simple.

28
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,409
You don’t need to remember all of this now.

29
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:22,390
What you should remember: all English verb
forms are made of these two parts: time plus

30
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,390
aspect.

31
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:29,030
One more point: different teachers, books
and courses sometimes use different words

32
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,660
for these things.

33
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,099
For example, some books use the word ‘progressive’
instead of ‘continuous’.

34
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:45,670
So, instead of ‘present continuous’, they
say ‘present progressive’.

35
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,379
Other words have the same problem.

36
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:56,250
For example, the words ‘tense’ and ‘aspect’
are used in different ways by different people.

37
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,989
Our advice?

38
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,799
Don’t think too much about the words.

39
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:02,150
Focus on the ideas.

40
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,430
I understand it can be confusing, but this
is really not your problem that people don’t

41
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,159
use these words consistently!

42
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:13,310
Next, let’s talk more about time.

43
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,629
I said we’re going to talk about past, present
and future, but really, we’re mostly going

44
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:20,349
to talk about the future.

45
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:23,660
Why—why is the future different?

46
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,670
English verbs have past and present forms.

47
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,670
For example:

48
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,459
be – was
do – did

49
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:36,000
want – wanted

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:47,140
So, to make a present form past, just change
the present verb to the past verb, like this:

51
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,760
I go shopping once a week.

52
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,290
→ I went shopping once a week.

53
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,519
She’s running in the park.

54
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,219
→ She was running in the park.

55
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:00,680
We haven’t seen it yet.

56
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,269
→ We hadn’t seen it yet.

57
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:12,629
It doesn’t matter if the aspect is simple,
continuous, perfect or perfect continuous.

58
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:19,040
Using a present or a past verb decides whether
the meaning is present or past.

59
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,790
That’s almost too simple, right?

60
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,520
But what about the future?

61
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,870
There are no future verb forms; you can’t
change the verb to make it future.

62
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,300
So, you have to add something before the verb.

63
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,300
For example:

64
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,550
I’ll be waiting for you outside the station.

65
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,100
When are you going to tell her?

66
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,470
He might join us later.

67
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,960
Now, you can see why the future is more complicated.

68
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,650
There are many things you can add before the
verb to give it a future meaning.

69
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,280
You saw examples with will, be going to and
might, but there are other possibilities.

70
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:08,740
It’s also very common to use present verb
forms with a future meaning, like this:

71
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,389
What are you doing this weekend?

72
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:13,919
Class starts at 10:00.

73
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,530
So, talking about the future is more complex.

74
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:25,750
There isn’t one way to give a verb a future
meaning in English, and there’s also a large

75
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:31,920
overlap between the present and the future.

76
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,210
What should you remember from all this?

77
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:42,199
Remember that every verb has only one past
form, and only one present form, but there

78
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,800
are many possible future forms.

79
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,289
There isn’t one ‘future tense’ in English.

80
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:52,190
Now, let’s talk about aspect.

81
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,949
Look at three sentences:

82
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:55,949
I went to Rome last year.

83
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:57,479
I go to work by bus.

84
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,199
I’ll go with you.

85
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,199
What are these three verb forms?

86
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:12,599
They’re all simple: past simple, present
simple, and future simple.

87
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:19,610
You can see that for the past and present
simple, you just use the present or past form

88
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,970
of the verb, without adding anything.

89
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:33,770
For the future simple, you need to add something,
like will or going to.

90
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:39,340
In general, simple verb forms describe two
things:

91
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,810
One: single actions.

92
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,380
Two: repeated actions or states.

93
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:54,490
So, I went to Rome or I’ll go with you describe
single actions in the past or the future.

94
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,230
I go to work by bus describes a repeated action
in the present.

95
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:04,190
The present simple can’t generally be used
to talk about single actions.

96
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:11,389
The present simple generally expresses repeated
actions or states.

97
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:17,669
The past and future simple can be used to
talk about single actions, repeated actions

98
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:19,630
or states.

99
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,669
For example:

100
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:24,540
I went to Rome every year until 2012.

101
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:30,700
I’ll go with you on Tuesday and Wednesday,
but I can’t on Thursday.

102
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,430
So, what about continuous verb forms?

103
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,800
Let’s start with three examples:

104
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,430
I was eating dinner at seven o’clock last
night.

105
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,340
I’m eating a tuna sandwich.

106
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,670
This time next week, I’ll be eating fresh
seafood on an island!

107
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:56,729
These three sentences are all continuous:
past continuous, present continuous and future

108
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:57,729
continuous.

109
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,270
Can you see what connects them?

110
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:10,699
First, all continuous forms use the verb be,
together with an -ing verb.

111
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:20,669
So, to make a continuous form, take the verb
be in the past, present or future, then add

112
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:25,120
your main verb with -ing on the end.

113
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,990
For example:

114
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,610
She was telling me a really interesting story.

115
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,910
They aren’t helping at all.

116
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:40,320
It’ll be getting dark at five o’clock.

117
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,020
What about the meaning of continuous forms?

118
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,850
Can you see what connects these examples?

119
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,400
Continuous forms describe things which are
incomplete.

120
00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:00,100
Generally, continuous forms are used to talk
about one moment in time.

121
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:07,330
So, you say I was eating dinner at seven o’clock
last night because you’re talking about

122
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:13,600
a moment in time (seven o’clock), and something
incomplete—you hadn’t finished your dinner

123
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,090
at that moment.

124
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,760
In the sentence She was telling me a really
interesting story, you’re talking about

125
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,940
a moment in time when she was in the middle
of her story.

126
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,730
You use a continuous form because, at that
moment, she hadn’t finished her story.

127
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,730
Okay, but what about perfect verb forms?

128
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:41,650
Again, let’s start with some examples:

129
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,160
He hadn’t finished speaking.

130
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,410
She’s finished all her homework.

131
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:53,070
We‘ll have finished everything by Friday.

132
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,030
What do you notice?

133
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,940
All perfect tenses use the verb have in the
past, present or future form.

134
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,190
After have, you use a past participle to make
the perfect form.

135
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:15,090
So, for example, to make the past perfect,
you take the past form of have, which is had,

136
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,650
and add a past participle.

137
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,650
For example:

138
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,040
We hadn’t thought about it.

139
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,170
I had never tried miso soup before.

140
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:32,630
For the future perfect, take the future form
of have, which could be will have, and add

141
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,050
a past participle, like this:

142
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:43,630
I’ll have finished all my exams by this
time next year.

143
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,950
What about the meaning of perfect verb forms?

144
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:52,130
Can you see anything which connects these
three sentences?

145
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:59,850
Perfect verb forms connect two points in time.

146
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,870
For example, He hadn’t finished speaking
is past perfect.

147
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,440
This connects two different times or actions
in the past.

148
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,270
To understand this, you need a longer sentence
with more information.

149
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,540
For example:

150
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,560
He hadn’t finished speaking when everybody
started to leave.

151
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,240
The perfect form connects the two different
actions.

152
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,890
This is the best way to think about perfect
verb forms: perfect verb forms connect two

153
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,240
points in time.

154
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,370
How does this work in the present?

155
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,790
This is present perfect.

156
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,340
What two points in time does this connect?

157
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,410
It connects the present and the past.

158
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:57,160
She’s finished her homework in the past
(before now), and now her homework is done

159
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,600
and ready to be checked (in the present).

160
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,740
What about the future?

161
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,620
This is the future perfect.

162
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:15,360
In this case, it connects the present to a
point in the future.

163
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,940
When you say We’ll have finished everything
by Friday, you mean that you’ll finish everything

164
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:27,990
some time between now and Friday.

165
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:33,580
You don’t know exactly when you’ll finish
everything, but you know that it will be somewhere

166
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,280
in this period between now and the future.

167
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,080
Finally, let’s look at perfect continuous
forms.

168
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,600
Here are three examples to begin:

169
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,800
She’d been feeling much better.

170
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,080
We’ve been waiting for ages.

171
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,000
By the end of the day, we’ll have been working
without a break for 14 hours.

172
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,730
What do you notice?

173
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:05,530
You can see that perfect continuous forms
are a mix of the perfect and the continuous,

174
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,810
which is logical, right?

175
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:15,810
They’re perfect forms because they use a
form of have plus a past participle, which

176
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:21,530
in perfect continuous verb forms is always
the same: been.

177
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:32,200
They’re continuous forms because they use
be plus a main verb with -ing.

178
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:38,780
How do you set the time of a perfect continuous
form?

179
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,590
You set the time by changing the form of have.

180
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:49,250
Use a past, present or future form of have,
plus been, plus a verb with -ing.

181
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,350
Let’s practise!

182
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,870
Here’s a sentence in the present simple.

183
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,100
I walk through the forest.

184
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,410
Can you change this sentence into the three
perfect continuous forms: past, present and

185
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,850
future?

186
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,020
Pause the video and try it!

187
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,530
Ready?

188
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:12,130
Let’s check your answers:

189
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,570
I had been walking through the forest.

190
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,700
I’ve been walking through the forest.

191
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,830
I will have been walking through the forest.

192
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,210
Did you get them right?

193
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:34,280
Next, let’s talk about the meaning of perfect
continuous forms.

194
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:42,950
Again, the meaning is a combination of the
two aspects: perfect and continuous.

195
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:52,420
So, the meaning is perfect because these forms
connect two points in time.

196
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,940
I had been walking through the forest...

197
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,960
...when something else happened.

198
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,670
For example:

199
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:12,830
I had been walking through the forest for
hours before I realised I was lost.

200
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:21,740
Like you saw before, the perfect aspect is
used to connect two points in the past.

201
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,520
What about the continuous side?

202
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,380
What meaning does that add?

203
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,640
It adds the idea of something incomplete or
temporary.

204
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:38,680
If you say, She’d been feeling much better,
this suggests she was feeling ill either before

205
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,230
or after she was feeling better.

206
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:48,060
If you say, We’ve been waiting for ages,
you mean that you still haven’t got what

207
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,550
you came for.

208
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,110
The action—waiting—is incomplete.

209
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:58,560
If you say, By the end of the day, we’ll
have been working without a break for 14 hours,

210
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,330
you mean that your work still won’t be finished
at the end of the day.

211
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:10,050
The past and future perfect continuous forms
are rare, but you still need them sometimes.

212
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:16,680
Okay, so now you’ve seen an overview of
all the English verb forms.

213
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,880
First of all, remember that this lesson is
meant to give you the big picture.

214
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:29,880
You’ve seen what connects different English
verb tenses, and how verb forms are different

215
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,550
from each other.

216
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,890
However, you’ve seen the most general connections
and differences.

217
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:42,760
This can help you to understand English verb
forms, but remember that every English verb

218
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,760
form has its own specific uses and meanings.

219
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,310
