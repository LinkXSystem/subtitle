00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,250
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,410
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,790
In this lesson, we’re going to talk about
motivation in English learning.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,740
You’re going to hear some tips for how to
manage your motivation and get better results

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,350
from your English studies.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,929
Before we start the lesson, don’t forget
to check out our website: Oxford Online English

7
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:23,400
dot com.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,350
We have free materials to help you practise
your English, and you can also study in online

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,690
classes with one of our professional English
teachers!

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:42,440
But now, let’s look at some important ideas
about what ‘motivation’ means.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,660
Idea number one: motivation isn’t something
you can just decide to have.

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,760
It’s not like an on/off switch inside you,
which you can just flip from ‘off’ to

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,800
‘on’ if you find the right trick.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,000
Instead, motivation is a *consequence*.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,420
It’s a consequence of your life goals, your
values, your environment and your lifestyle.

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,660
You can’t decide to change your motivation
directly, but you can change other things

17
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,580
in your life which influence your motivation.

18
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,380
Idea number two: real motivation is deep motivation.

19
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,980
If you struggle to find the motivation to
study English, then that’s a deep problem.

20
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,710
There’s also ‘fake’ motivation.

21
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:35,460
This is the kind of motivation which makes
people join a gym and pay for a year’s membership

22
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:42,580
on January the 2nd, and then go once or twice
in the whole year.

23
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,490
This isn’t real motivation.

24
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:54,680
Often, fake motivation comes from other people,
but it disappears as quickly as it arrives.

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,740
Real motivation is deep motivation; it comes
from inside, and it takes time and work to

26
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,100
develop.

27
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,610
Most importantly, idea number three: it’s
hard to develop and maintain motivation, but

28
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,330
it’s easy to kill it.

29
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:18,450
Lots of things can kill your motivation: a
bad teacher, a busy job, a newborn baby who

30
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,870
doesn’t sleep well, financial worries, video
game addiction, and many more.

31
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,230
So, you have to look after your motivation
carefully.

32
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:32,489
You need to think about many aspects of your
life, not just study-related questions.

33
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,510
You’ll learn about these points in more
detail over the rest of this lesson.

34
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,820
Let’s move on.

35
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,350
We won’t spend long on this section.

36
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,500
Why not?

37
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,709
Because we already made a whole video about
it!

38
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:51,819
You should watch it, if you haven’t already.

39
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:55,660
Remember that it’s easy to kill your motivation.

40
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,840
Not knowing how to set study goals is one
of the best ways to kill your motivation to

41
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,770
learn English.

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,209
If you set yourself goals like, ‘I want
to speak like a native speaker,’ or, ‘I

43
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:11,510
want to speak English perfectly,’ this will
kill your motivation.

44
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,660
Where do you start with goals like these?

45
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,440
What’s the first step?

46
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,050
How do you know when you’ve finished?

47
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,569
There are no answers to these questions, which
is why these goals are no good for you.

48
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:34,450
You need to set goals which are specific,
measurable, achievable, relevant and timebound:

49
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,000
SMART goals.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,040
We’ll give you one more idea here which
we didn’t mention in the SMART goals video.

51
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:50,910
Don’t compare yourself to native speakers;
don’t aim to speak perfect English; instead,

52
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:57,340
just ask yourself one question: how can I
improve?

53
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,340
This is how I approach teaching, by the way.

54
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,830
This is the question that’s in my head when
I meet a new student: how can I make this

55
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,379
person’s English better?

56
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,560
Students come to me with all sorts of goals;
they have different budgets, and different

57
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,459
amounts of time they want to spend on studying.

58
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,930
They’re starting at different levels.

59
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,220
Some people are ambitious; others just want
to learn one or two simple points.

60
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,639
With each person, there are different possibilities.

61
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,720
I don’t worry about those things; I just
ask myself: what can I do to make this person’s

62
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,930
English better?

63
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,380
You can benefit from thinking in the same
way.

64
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:43,010
This idea makes things simpler, and it helps
you to focus on specific, concrete steps to

65
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,630
learn and improve.

66
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,919
Guess what: that’s good for your motivation!

67
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:55,830
Overall, nothing is better for your motivation
than feeling like you’re making progress.

68
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:02,699
If you can feel that you’re improving, you’ll
feel more motivated to continue studying.

69
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:08,370
Setting good goals is vital to keep your motivation
alive and healthy.

70
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:16,400
However, there’s another point which is
equally important.

71
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,470
Your motivation depends greatly on your environment.

72
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,310
This means: where you live, where you work,
what kind of work you do, who you talk to

73
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,330
every day, how you spend your free time, and
so on.

74
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,790
Let’s take two examples.

75
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,870
Imagine two people.

76
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,699
We’ll call them Sam and Alex.

77
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:43,740
They’re not real, but the ideas are similar
to many students we’ve met.

78
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,810
Sam lives in Amsterdam.

79
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:51,580
She doesn’t speak Dutch, so she mostly uses
English in her day-to-day life.

80
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,440
She works in a software firm, where all office
communication is in English.

81
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,729
She regularly attends meetings, participates
in conference calls, and gives presentations

82
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:05,960
in English.

83
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,009
Outside of work, most of her friends are expats
from other countries.

84
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:17,509
Their common language is English, so most
of the time, Sam speaks English outside of

85
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,990
work, too.

86
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:26,330
She only speaks her native language with one
or two friends, or when she calls her family

87
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,900
and friends back home.

88
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,070
Alex lives in Taipei.

89
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:38,419
He speaks intermediate-level English, but
he rarely uses it in his daily life.

90
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:42,730
He works for the marketing department of a
large company, and most of his day-to-day

91
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,430
work is in Mandarin or Taiwanese.

92
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,960
At home and with his friends, he mostly speaks
Taiwanese.

93
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,460
He goes to English classes twice a week because
he wants to improve; he has a dream of studying

94
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,620
in Australia or the UK, but he knows that
his English level isn’t high enough.

95
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,770
He often feels too tired to study, or that
he doesn’t have enough spare time.

96
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,500
Besides, he feels like studying doesn’t
make any difference to his English level.

97
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:17,620
He feels frustrated because his progress is
slow.

98
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,820
What do you think?

99
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,530
Do these stories sound familiar to you?

100
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,420
Are you more like Sam, or more like Alex?

101
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,010
Remember: these aren’t real people!

102
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:35,430
However, I think Alex’s situation will sound
familiar to many of you.

103
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,200
We meet and hear from *so many* English learners
who are in this situation.

104
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:48,280
Here’s another question: what can Alex do
to feel more motivated?

105
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,920
How can he deal with these feelings of frustration?

106
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,639
Short answer: he can’t, or at least, not
easily.

107
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,900
That might sound like a demotivational answer!

108
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,849
We’re not trying to kill your motivation,
of course, but you need to understand what

109
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:10,479
you can and can’t do to make a difference
if you’re in the same situation.

110
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,950
Here’s the problem: Alex lives in an environment
where he doesn’t need to use English.

111
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:24,100
Sure, he has his dream of studying abroad,
but for most people, future dreams aren’t

112
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,300
enough.

113
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:31,960
You need something *now*—or at least, in
the near future—which gives you motivation.

114
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,700
Alex doesn’t have that.

115
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:40,539
There’s nothing in his life *now* which
means he needs to improve his English.

116
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:42,599
That limits his motivation.

117
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,679
He feels like he’s too busy or too tired
to study.

118
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,709
When you say you’re ‘too busy’ or ‘too
tired’, that means you don’t have enough

119
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:54,540
motivation.

120
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:00,420
When you care about something, you find the
time; you find the energy.

121
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:07,980
When Alex says he’s too busy, he really
means that it’s not a high enough priority.

122
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,390
When you say you’re too tired to study or
practise, you’re saying it’s not a high

123
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,350
enough priority.

124
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:22,860
Alex’s environment limits his motivation,
and his motivation limits his potential progress.

125
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,629
Not making progress hurts his motivation even
more.

126
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:29,910
Over time, nothing changes.

127
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:35,329
He spends time and money on English courses,
but his situation doesn’t change in any

128
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:37,740
meaningful way.

129
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,080
Motivation won’t just appear out of thin
air.

130
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:43,279
He needs to change something.

131
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,920
If you’re in Alex’s position, you need
to change something.

132
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,829
You need to give yourself something *now*
or in the near future which means that you

133
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:54,809
*need* English.

134
00:09:54,809 --> 00:10:00,300
You need something which is a central part
of your life, and which you cannot do without

135
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,140
English.

136
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,680
Let’s think about Sam for a moment.

137
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:11,279
Sam doesn’t have these problems, because
if she did, she couldn’t live her life.

138
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,049
She couldn’t do her job or talk to her friends
if her English wasn’t good enough.

139
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:22,629
So, if her English was weak in some areas,
she would fix those problems.

140
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:25,089
She would find a solution.

141
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:31,079
Maybe she’d do it herself, maybe she’d
ask a friend, or maybe she’d study with

142
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:32,589
a teacher.

143
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:38,500
It doesn’t matter; she *would* find a solution,
because she has to.

144
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,579
Let’s think about you.

145
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:46,110
What does this mean for you?

146
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,649
It means two things, and neither of them is
easy.

147
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:55,720
One: if this is your problem, then you need
to change your environment.

148
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,040
You need to make changes in where you live,
or where you work, or how you spend your free

149
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,699
time, so that you need English in your day-to-day
life.

150
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:08,790
I know that a lot of you are thinking, “Great
advice, guys!

151
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,079
I can’t just move to another country!

152
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:14,910
I can’t just get a job in a multinational
company!”

153
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,060
Yeah, I know.

154
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,230
It’s not easy, but you need to do something.

155
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:26,490
Start small: try to find expat groups or social
activities in your city where there are English-speaking

156
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,149
foreigners.

157
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:33,589
If you work for a company which sometimes
deals with foreign clients, ask your manager

158
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:36,230
if there’s a way for you to be involved.

159
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:42,199
We can’t tell you exactly what to do, because
you have your life, and everyone watching

160
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:45,739
this will have different possibilities.

161
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:51,580
All we can say is: you need to do something,
and if you have no idea what to do, start

162
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,689
with something small.

163
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:56,470
We said there are two things you need to think
about.

164
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,759
What’s the second?

165
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,370
Two: you need to take risks.

166
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:09,269
That means that you put yourself in a situation
where you might fail, and that failure might

167
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:12,079
hurt.

168
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,290
Think about Sam and Alex again.

169
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,309
Sam cannot live her life if her English isn’t
good enough.

170
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:23,579
She’ll lose her job and she’ll struggle
in social situations.

171
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:28,560
For Alex, there are no consequences if he
doesn’t make progress.

172
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,809
He just stays in the same place.

173
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:39,240
Maybe he’s unhappy with that, but for most
people, that’s not enough to give you motivation.

174
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,489
You need to take risks.

175
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:47,639
That means things like talking to people when
you’re nervous or uncomfortable, moving

176
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:55,880
to a new city, or volunteering to make an
important presentation at work in English.

177
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,739
And again, we know this isn’t easy.

178
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:00,819
But, it’s necessary.

179
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:06,249
If you live in a way that means you don’t
need to improve your English right now, then

180
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:12,649
you’ll probably struggle to find the motivation
to study and practise.

181
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:17,800
You need to put yourself in an environment
where you need English, and where failure

182
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,160
to improve is painful.

183
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:27,989
‘Painful’ means that your life is more
difficult and more limited if you’re not

184
00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:30,290
getting better.

185
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,810
We know a lot of people watching this are
going to say, ‘I can’t…’

186
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,009
‘I can’t make changes…’

187
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:36,939
‘It’s too difficult…’

188
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:37,939
Maybe.

189
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:38,939
Maybe not.

190
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:40,749
I don’t know the details of your life.

191
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:44,720
I don’t know what’s possible or not for
you.

192
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,329
Just remember: your environment limits your
motivation, and your motivation limits your

193
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,329
progress.

194
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,769
There’s no way around that.

195
00:13:52,769 --> 00:14:00,540
Finally, let’s talk about one more thing
you need to know.

196
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:06,369
Up to now, we’ve talked about developing
and building your motivation, about how to

197
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:11,299
feel more motivated to study and improve your
English.

198
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:18,869
We’re going to tell you something which
might sound strange, but it’s just as important:

199
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:21,990
your motivation is always limited.

200
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:27,920
You’ll get better results—and be happier—if
you understand this.

201
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:35,179
Here’s a question: how long can you sit
and study by yourself before you get bored

202
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:38,769
and you find it difficult to concentrate?

203
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:40,350
Half an hour?

204
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,760
An hour?

205
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,240
Two?

206
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,480
What if you have to study every day for a
month?

207
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,850
Could you still do the same amount?

208
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,389
How long can you spend in an English class
before you start to feel bored and you want

209
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:02,329
to do something else?

210
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:07,980
How long can you spend speaking English before
you feel tired and you have an urge to speak

211
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,220
your own language?

212
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,600
You’ll all have different answers, but all
of you watching this will have a limit.

213
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,779
Your limit might be lower or higher, but it’s
there.

214
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:25,139
These limits control how much time you can
spend working on your English.

215
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,889
You can try forcing yourself to study when
you’re bored, but it’s not effective.

216
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:33,889
If it works, it only works for a short time.

217
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:38,739
That’s because feeling bored is your brain’s
way of saying to you: “This isn’t important

218
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:41,660
enough to spend our time on!”

219
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,299
Remember: motivation isn’t something you
can just decide to have.

220
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:52,239
You have a certain amount of motivation, and
you need to decide how you use it.

221
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:54,720
Don’t be hard on yourself.

222
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,639
Feeling bored is natural, and everyone has
their limits!

223
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,619
But, it means that you need to set clear goals,
as we talked about before.

224
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:12,609
Also, you need to set priorities based on
the time and energy you have available.

225
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:18,319
If you can study for thirty minutes before
you start getting bored, you need to think:

226
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:24,509
what can you do in thirty minutes which will
help you the most?

227
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:30,569
Many English learners overestimate their motivation,
and set goals which they don’t actually

228
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:33,060
have the motivation to achieve.

229
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:40,040
We’ve met so many students who say they
want to study for hours every day, but most

230
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:46,439
of them give up quickly, because they don’t
have enough motivation to do the things they

231
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:49,669
say they want to do.

232
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:52,339
You can see this from the other side, too.

233
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:57,529
If you can speak in English for half an hour
before your concentration starts to fade,

234
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:04,720
then ask yourself: how can you have a 30-minute
conversation in English every day or most days?

235
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,439
Who can you talk to?

236
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:12,839
You have enough motivation and the energy
to do this, so you should try to use that.

237
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,890
How do you manage your motivation when studying
English?

238
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:21,029
Have you experienced the things we’ve talked
about in this lesson?

239
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:25,970
If so, please let us know in the comments;
we’d love to hear your ideas!

240
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,689
Thanks for watching!

241
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:28,899
See you next time!
