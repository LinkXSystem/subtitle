1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,240
Hi Mikey!

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,160
Hi Stephanie!

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,680
Well, this is awkward!

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,500
Yeah, it is a bit.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,110
We’ve got nothing to talk about!

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,130
That’s right!

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,310
I just have no idea what to say to you.

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,750
I’ve got an idea.

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,830
Oh, what’s that?

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,980
Let’s do a lesson about how to have a conversation
in English.

11
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,230
Great idea!

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,850
Looks like we really need it.

13
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,369
Shall we start now?

14
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:30,320
Yeah, why not?

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,270
Hi, I’m Stephanie.

16
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,340
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

17
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,840
Do you find it difficult to start conversations
in English?

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,070
Do you feel that you don’t know what to
say?

19
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,840
It’s common.

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,800
Speaking a foreign language is hard work.

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,581
You have to remember foreign words, pronounce
sounds which your mouth isn’t used to, and

22
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:54,550
now you have to build a conversation, too.

23
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,410
In this lesson, you’ll see some simple,
effective tips to help you start, develop

24
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,150
and end a conversation in English.

25
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,250
Let’s start at the very beginning.

26
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:11,620
You’ll see three easy ways to start a conversation
in English.

27
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,420
Hello!

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,420
My name’s Mikey.

29
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,420
What’s your name?

30
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,420
Stephanie, nice to meet you.

31
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,560
Where are you from, Stephanie?

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,950
So, what did you think of the film?

33
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,530
It was… interesting.

34
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,020
Does that mean you didn’t like it?

35
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,909
I’m glad I saw it, but I wouldn’t watch
it again.

36
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:35,600
Oh, hey, I saw some of your pictures from
your trip.

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,619
They’re amazing!

38
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:38,829
Thanks for saying so!

39
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:40,520
What kind of camera do you use?

40
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,590
Actually, I just use my phone.

41
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:49,479
First of all, if you don’t know the other
person, of course you should introduce yourself.

42
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:53,979
It can be awkward if you start talking and
then you realise an hour later that you don’t

43
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:56,229
know the other person’s name.

44
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,319
You saw three ways to start a conversation.

45
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,139
What were they?

46
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:04,969
One: ask a simple question:

47
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:07,799
What’s your name?

48
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,040
Where are you from?

49
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,280
What do you do?

50
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,230
Two: make a comment or ask a question about
the situation you’re in:

51
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,140
That looks delicious!

52
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,580
What is it?

53
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,270
What did you think of the film?

54
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,120
It’s so cold in here!

55
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,690
Is the heating broken?

56
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,690
Great party, right?

57
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,060
Who do you know here?

58
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,430
Three: compliment the other person:

59
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,990
I love your top!

60
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,490
Where did you get it?

61
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,900
I thought your presentation was really interesting.

62
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,500
Oh, you’re Mikey?

63
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,700
I’ve heard so many good things about you.

64
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,100
Don’t think too much about what you say
first.

65
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,730
When you start a conversation, it’s more
important to say something, even if it’s

66
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,250
something very simple.

67
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,840
Easy, right?

68
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,760
Introduce yourself, say something simple,
and you’ve started a conversation.

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,690
Next, you need to build the conversation.

70
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,360
Where do you go from here?

71
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,740
Hey, you’re Stephanie, right?

72
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,480
Yeah.

73
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,180
Mikey?

74
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,340
That’s right!

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,480
Peter told me you’re in a band?

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, kind of.

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,620
I play guitar, and we just play together for
fun.

78
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,230
It’s nothing serious.

79
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,550
I play the guitar too, actually.

80
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,550
Really?

81
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,750
What kind of thing do you play?

82
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,640
Actually, I play classical guitar.

83
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,860
I just do it as a hobby; I’m not that good,
but I enjoy it.

84
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,700
That’s the important thing.

85
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,170
Anyway, how do you know Peter?

86
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,460
We used to work together, and we stayed in
touch.

87
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:49,030
Here, you saw three useful things you can
do to build a conversation in English.

88
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,130
Do you know what they were?

89
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,860
They’re all very simple.

90
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,980
Anyone can use them!

91
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,080
First idea: make a reference to something
you have in common.

92
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,330
For example, do you know that the other person
is a football fan?

93
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,330
Ask:

94
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,370
Who do you support?

95
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,110
Or: Did you see the City game on Sunday?

96
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:18,800
Or: What’s your prediction for the cup final
next weekend?

97
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,340
If you meet someone while you’re travelling,
you could ask:

98
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,550
Where are you going to next?

99
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,180
You went to Rome?

100
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,040
Any recommendations?

101
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,440
Do you know any good places to eat around
here?

102
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,840
We said that you saw three ways to continue
a conversation.

103
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,259
What’s the second one?

104
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:43,220
Ask the other person about themselves and
their life.

105
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,389
People generally like to talk about themselves,
and they like it when other people are interested

106
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,620
in them, so this can be very effective.

107
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,910
For example:

108
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,650
Your job sounds really difficult.

109
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,810
How do you manage everything?

110
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,400
I like your pictures.

111
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,099
Is that in India?

112
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:03,530
I heard you’re really into cooking.

113
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,580
What kind of stuff do you like to make?

114
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,260
Finally, you can also continue the conversation
by referring to someone you both know, like

115
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,560
this:

116
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,620
How do you know Lisa?

117
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,610
Have you known Simon long?

118
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,770
You work with Lee?

119
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,900
I heard he can be quite difficult.

120
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,830
Again, it’s more important to say something,
even if it’s something very basic.

121
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,160
When you’ve just started talking to someone,
anything is better than saying nothing.

122
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,870
The longer you can keep the conversation going,
the more you’ll learn about each other,

123
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,960
and the more topics you’ll have to explore.

124
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:47,220
Let’s look at some other important points
to think about as your conversation continues.

125
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,550
Mikey, hi!

126
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,550
How was your trip?

127
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,389
It was great, thanks.

128
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:52,389
Where did you go?

129
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,560
Well, we started in Madrid, and then…

130
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,389
Where did you stay?

131
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,259
We found a really great homestay near the
centre, and…

132
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,259
Did you eat tapas?

133
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,729
Well, yeah, a couple of times, but…

134
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,460
Did you go to the Royal Palace?

135
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,580
No, actually, we…

136
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,499
Why not?

137
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:11,479
Yeah, so as I was saying, it’s basically
the best film ever.

138
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:12,479
Mm-hmm.

139
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,690
I mean, people don’t rate Michael Bay, but
I really think the man’s a genius, you know?

140
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,690
Mm-hmm.

141
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,259
I’ve seen it twice at the cinema already.

142
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,689
The last time I went it was so loud that I
still couldn’t hear properly the next morning.

143
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:27,689
Mm-hmm.

144
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,870
I’m still planning to see it again this
weekend, though.

145
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,870
I love it!

146
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,870
Mm-hmm.

147
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,550
You saw two conversations.

148
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,669
I hope you realise that these were examples
of what not to do when you want to build a

149
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:41,080
conversation.

150
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,090
What was the problem in each one?

151
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,830
In both conversations, there was a lack of
balance.

152
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,750
In the first conversation, I was asking too
many questions!

153
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,509
A conversation shouldn’t sound like a police
interrogation.

154
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:01,210
In the second conversation, I spoke too much,
even though Stephanie clearly wasn’t interested

155
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,820
in what I was talking about.

156
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,080
What’s the point here?

157
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,569
For a successful conversation, you need balance.

158
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:14,090
You need to balance asking questions and saying
what you think.

159
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,129
You need to balance speaking and listening.

160
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:21,469
Let’s look at how those conversations could
have gone better:

161
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:22,469
Mikey, hi!

162
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:23,490
How was your trip?

163
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,259
It was great, thanks.

164
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:26,259
Where did you go?

165
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:30,360
Well, we started in Madrid, and then we spent
a few days in Andalucia.

166
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
Wow!

167
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,569
I loved Madrid.

168
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:33,770
What did you think of it?

169
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,249
We really liked it.

170
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:40,499
When we were there, we stayed at this really
cool guesthouse near the Parque de El Retiro.

171
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:42,449
Did you spend any time around there?

172
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:45,379
Actually, we were staying a bit further out.

173
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:46,750
We did walk past there, though.

174
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,719
There are some great places further out, too.

175
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,809
What did you think of the food?

176
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:53,229
Guess what I just saw?

177
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:54,229
What?

178
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:55,710
The new Transformers film!

179
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,110
It’s amazing!

180
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,060
I really think Michael Bay is one of the best
directors alive.

181
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,060
Are you serious?

182
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,710
What, you don’t like his films?

183
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,710
No.

184
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,789
I think a good movie needs more than explosions
and robots.

185
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,309
That’s a shame.

186
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:12,979
I was hoping you’d come to the cinema with
me to watch it.

187
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:14,819
I thought you’d already seen it?

188
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:15,919
Yeah, twice!

189
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,319
The last time, the sound system was so loud
that I couldn’t hear properly the next morning.

190
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,409
It was great!

191
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:24,300
That doesn’t sound healthy.

192
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,520
Maybe you should go to the doctor’s, and
you definitely shouldn’t go to see it again.

193
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,979
Balancing your conversations helps you to
keep the other person engaged, which means

194
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,419
the conversation will flow easily and naturally.

195
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:42,480
Anyway, let’s talk about something else.

196
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,980
Sometimes, people complain to us about making
conversation in English: “I don’t know

197
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,139
what to talk about!”

198
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:53,870
Here’s the thing: you can talk about almost
anything you want.

199
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,230
Sometimes, the other person isn’t interested
in what you’re saying.

200
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,230
Sometimes, you’re not interested in what
the other person’s saying.

201
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:07,220
Sometimes, neither of you is interested in
what you’re talking about.

202
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,790
This is totally natural.

203
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,880
So, what should you do?

204
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,779
Change the topic, of course!

205
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:16,390
Seen any good TV shows recently?

206
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,509
Actually, I don’t have a TV.

207
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:20,509
Oh…

208
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:24,380
So, er, what are you doing this weekend?

209
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,949
Do you like travelling?

210
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:27,970
Not really.

211
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,250
When I don’t have to work, I just stay at
home.

212
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,080
Anyway, whereabouts do you live?

213
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,140
Yeah, I’ve had this really bad cough for
weeks.

214
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:42,170
All this green stuff keeps coming out of me.

215
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,370
I don’t know when it’s going to stop.

216
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,340
Mikey, I’m trying to eat!

217
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,270
Can we please talk about something else?

218
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,339
Oh, sorry.

219
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,709
Changing the subject is easy.

220
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:57,100
The easiest way is just to… change the subject!

221
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,730
If what you’re talking about isn’t going
anywhere, ask a question or make a comment

222
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,320
about something different.

223
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,330
It’s common to introduce a change of subject
with a word like so or anyway.

224
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,510
For example:

225
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,610
So, what are you doing this weekend?

226
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,029
Anyway, whereabouts do you live?

227
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:24,529
If you’re feeling uncomfortable with a conversation
topic, you might clearly ask to change the

228
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:25,970
subject.

229
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,220
You can say something like:

230
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,420
Can we talk about something else?

231
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,250
Let’s change the subject.

232
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,269
I don’t really want to talk about that.

233
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:41,550
Remember that if you use phrases like these,
you’re clearly showing the other person

234
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,589
that you’re uncomfortable with the conversation.

235
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:48,920
If you say something like this, make sure
that you mean it.

236
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:57,480
Finally, let’s see one of the most important
skills for having good conversations in English:

237
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,040
…so then I say to her, ‘You must be joking!’,
and she’s all like, ‘No’, and I’m

238
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,450
all like, ‘That is so crazy!’, and then…

239
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:10,449
Adele, I hate to be rude, but I have to be
somewhere else.

240
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:12,350
We’ll talk later, okay?

241
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,500
Oh, okay.

242
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,750
See you later!

243
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,100
You’re an events manager?

244
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,740
That’s exactly what I want to get into!

245
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,790
I have so many questions.

246
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,259
So, what’s the best way to get a job with
your company?

247
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,390
Will you help me out?

248
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,290
Listen, it’s been great talking to you,
but I should get back to work.

249
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,959
Can I ask you my questions later?

250
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,389
I have SO MANY.

251
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:35,130
Sure, just call me.

252
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,199
But, I don’t have your phone number!

253
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,930
Have you finished the debugging work?

254
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,510
It’s nearly done.

255
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,860
Is there any chance you can ask someone to
help me?

256
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,459
It’s a lot of work.

257
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:48,160
I’ll see what I can do.

258
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,100
Anyway, I won’t keep you any longer.

259
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,449
Try to have the work done by tomorrow evening.

260
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:54,449
Alright.

261
00:11:54,449 --> 00:12:01,060
Here, you saw three short conversations with
three different ways to leave a conversation.

262
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,930
Do you remember them?

263
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,980
Here are the three phrases you saw:

264
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,070
I hate to be rude, but…

265
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,399
It’s been great talking to you, but...

266
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,269
I won’t keep you any longer.

267
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:21,690
You can also add the person’s name to make
it sound more personal:

268
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,630
Stephanie, I hate to be rude, but…

269
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:31,170
Paul, it’s been great talking to you, but…

270
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,759
You can make these phrases sound stronger
by adding a word like look or listen at the

271
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,759
start:

272
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,470
Look, I hate to be rude, but…

273
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,910
Listen, it’s been great talking to you,
but…

274
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:52,029
Saying it like this adds emphasis and makes
it extra clear that the conversation is finishing.

275
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:55,339
After the word but, make an excuse:

276
00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:00,420
Stephanie, I hate to be rude, but I have to catch
the last metro.

277
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,840
Paul, it’s been great talking to you, but
there are some other people here I need to

278
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,040
catch up with.

279
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,490
Another good way to leave a conversation is
to pretend that you’re stopping the other

280
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,950
person from leaving.

281
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,730
You can say something like:

282
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,449
I won’t keep you any longer.

283
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:21,500
Or: I’ll let you get back to work.

284
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,290
On the phone, it’s common to say:

285
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,680
I’ll let you go.

286
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,300
This is a clear signal that the conversation
is ending.

287
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,640
Then, say goodbye, and you’re finished!

288
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,620
You can see that starting, developing and
ending a conversation in English is quite

289
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,750
simple.

290
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:44,069
Use the tips and language from this lesson,
and you’ll be able to have natural conversations

291
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:45,509
in English easily!

292
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:50,639
Anyway, it’s been great talking to you,
but we really have to go!
