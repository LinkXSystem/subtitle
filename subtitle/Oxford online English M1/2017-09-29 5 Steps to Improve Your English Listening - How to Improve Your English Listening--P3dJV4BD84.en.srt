00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,730
Hi, I'm Kasia.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,580
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,190
In this lesson, you’re going to learn how
you can improve your English listening.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:16,430
You’ll see simple, effective tips that anyone
can use to improve their English listening

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,430
skills.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,000
We’ll also give you a practical, easy-to-follow
study plan to help you improve your English

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,420
listening fast.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,470
But first, let’s start with some questions.

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:35,170
I’m going to ask you about four different
situations where you would hear spoken English.

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,890
You should think about whether understanding
spoken English would be easy or difficult

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,329
for you.

12
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:42,469
OK?

13
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:50,309
First, you’re listening to an English teacher,
speaking British English, speaking slowly

14
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:51,969
and clearly.

15
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,440
Easy or difficult?

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,950
Next, you’re listening to a native English
speaker from Scotland, who speaks with a Scottish

17
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:06,240
accent, and also uses a lot of slang and idiomatic
English.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,490
What do you think: would this be easy or difficult
for you?

19
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,800
Next, you’re on a train.

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,550
There are four non-native speakers from four
different countries talking to each other.

21
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,750
They have different accents.

22
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,200
Do you think you could understand their conversation?

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,390
Would it depend on where they were from?

24
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:34,600
Finally, you’re listening to a news show
on the radio or as a podcast.

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,010
There are many different speakers, and of
course you can’t see them.

26
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:45,360
They’re talking fast, using a lot of less
common vocabulary, and changing topics often.

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,330
How would you find this?

28
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:54,540
Probably, most of you think that the first
situation is the easiest, and the last situation

29
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,790
is the hardest.

30
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:01,020
However, a lot depends on you and your experiences.

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,880
The big question is: what can you do in those
difficult situations?

32
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,470
You’ve been studying English for years,
but you still can’t understand everything

33
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,750
you hear.

34
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,850
We get it—it’s frustrating!

35
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,190
So, what can you do?

36
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:27,380
Here’s a question: if you worry a lot about
your English listening, will it make your

37
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,370
English listening better?

38
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,640
No, of course not!

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,200
Many English learners get very stressed and
anxious when they can’t understand something.

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,671
This doesn’t help your English listening,
and it can even make it more difficult to

41
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:45,650
understand spoken English.

42
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,650
To understand a foreign language, you need
100% of your brain power.

43
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,190
"Why can't I understand this?"

44
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,320
"What was that word he just used?"

45
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,100
"They're speaking too quickly!"

46
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,910
If you're worrying and thinking thoughts like
this, you aren't concentrating on listening.

47
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:10,680
You’re focusing on your own worries and
thoughts, and not on what you’re hearing.

48
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,900
This makes it harder to understand, not easier!

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,720
So, relax!

50
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,290
If you understand, you understand.

51
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,830
If you don’t, you don't—it's not the end
of the world!

52
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:29,300
By relaxing and focusing 100% on what you're
hearing, you have the best chance to understand.

53
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:45,600
[Portuguese audio]

54
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:50,300
That’s Portuguese, if 
you didn’t know.

55
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,520
I don’t know one word of Portuguese, so
I can’t understand anything she’s saying.

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,750
Is that a problem?

57
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,750
No.

58
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,190
Am I worried or stressed?

59
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,569
No.

60
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:08,960
If I listen carefully, I can hear a few words
which sound a little familiar, so I could maybe guess

61
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,800
the topic in a very general way.

62
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,819
Take the same attitude when listening to English.

63
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:18,940
If you don’t understand, there’s nothing
you can do about it.

64
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,000
So, relax!

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,280
Being relaxed and focused gives you the best
chance to understand what you hear.

66
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:34,680
Remember: you need 100% of your brain power
to understand spoken English, or any foreign

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,430
language.

68
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,180
You know what takes a lot of brain power?

69
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,610
Translating English into your language!

70
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,490
So, you can’t do both.

71
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,340
Professional interpreters, who translate spoken
language as they hear it, have a very difficult

72
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,340
job.

73
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:58,130
In fact, they can only work a few hours a
day because it requires so much concentration.

74
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,530
If you listen to English and try to translate
into your language at the same time, you're

75
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,090
trying to be a professional interpreter, except
you haven’t had the years of training that

76
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,760
they’ve had.

77
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,370
Also, you’re not getting paid like they
are.

78
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,960
Doesn’t sound like a good deal, right?

79
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,300
Again, when you’re listening to spoken English,
just listen.

80
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,440
Don’t do anything else.

81
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,330
Don’t try to translate things.

82
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,990
Don’t worry about words you don’t know.

83
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,240
Don’t think about things you didn’t hear.

84
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,230
Just listen.

85
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,160
Want to know a simple secret about understanding
spoken English?

86
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,030
You don’t have to understand what someone
said to understand what they mean.

87
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,190
Wait, what?

88
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,350
It’s true.

89
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:54,810
Very often, I see English learners focusing
too much on the things they don’t understand.

90
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:01,290
I hear things like, “There was a word I
didn’t know, so I couldn’t understand.”

91
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:08,090
Here’s the thing: understanding doesn’t
just depend on listening.

92
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,270
Very often, there are other things you can
use.

93
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,490
For example, if you’re face to face with
someone, you can use their body language,

94
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,449
tone of voice and facial expressions to help
you understand what they mean.

95
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:24,180
Also, think about the situation you’re in.

96
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,090
What is the other person likely to say?

97
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,360
What words are they likely to use?

98
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,300
For example, imagine you’re at the airport.

99
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,020
You’re checking in for your flight.

100
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,460
What questions might you expect to hear?

101
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,310
You’d probably hear questions like:

102
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,040
Did you pack these bags yourself?

103
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,770
Have you already checked in online?

104
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:53,310
Would you like an aisle seat or a window seat?

105
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,700
Imagine you hear the last question, but you
don’t know what aisle means.

106
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,479
Even if you’ve never heard the word before,
it shouldn’t stop you from understanding

107
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,840
the question.

108
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,070
You know that there are two choices, aisle
seat or window seat.

109
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,610
You know what window seat means.

110
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,449
You know that aisle seat must mean something
different from window seat.

111
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:20,380
So, you can work it out.

112
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,900
Similarly, imagine you hear this:

113
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:29,040
Have you mbrmmnbsmgrm chicken online?

114
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
Chicken?

115
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Did he say ‘chicken’?

116
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,120
That doesn’t make sense…

117
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,740
Right, it doesn’t make sense.

118
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:41,620
So, probably the person behind the check-in
desk didn’t say ‘chicken’, he probably

119
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,400
said ‘check-in’, because that’s what
you’re doing: you’re checking in for your

120
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,919
flight.

121
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:53,639
So, when you’re listening to spoken English,
use everything you can to help you understand.

122
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:59,320
Don’t think: “I didn’t understand one
word, so I can’t understand anything.”

123
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,030
It’s just not true!

124
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,530
At the beginning of this lesson, we looked
at different situations where it might be

125
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,720
easier or more difficult for you to understand
spoken English.

126
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,350
Generally, if you’re familiar with something,
it’ll be easier to understand.

127
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:26,300
For example, if you learn English from a teacher,
and your teacher is male and British, you’ll

128
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,110
probably find male British voices easier to
understand.

129
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,349
On the other hand, you might find female voices
slightly more difficult.

130
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:41,500
You might find other accents, like American
voices or Australian voices, harder to understand.

131
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,100
So, what’s the solution?

132
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,110
Very simple: listen to as many different voices
as possible!

133
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,399
Don’t limit yourself.

134
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,170
If you only listen to one kind of English,
you’ll be good at understanding one kind

135
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,689
of English.

136
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:03,200
So, listen to different kinds of English.

137
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,399
Listen to English people from the north, south,
east and west of the country.

138
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,819
Listen to Scottish speakers, Welsh speakers,
and Irish speakers; listen to men, women and

139
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:22,440
children; listen to Americans, Australians,
Canadians and South Africans.

140
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,189
Listen to Indian, Chinese, Russian or Brazilian
English speakers.

141
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:28,649
What's that?

142
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:31,629
You only want to listen to native English?

143
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:38,519
Fine, but remember that more English is spoken
between non-native speakers in the world today,

144
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:44,100
so it could be a very good use of your time
to listen to non-native English as well.

145
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,740
It’s not just about listening to different
voices.

146
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,009
You should listen to as many different formats
and sources as possible.

147
00:09:53,009 --> 00:10:00,519
So, listen to songs, TV shows, films, audiobooks,
textbook exercises, and anything else you

148
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,189
can find.

149
00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:09,600
All of the advice in this lesson will help
you improve your English listening, but you

150
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,839
also need a practical plan to work on your
English listening.

151
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,279
Let’s make a plan together.

152
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,279
Ready?

153
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,139
It’s very simple: you just need to follow
two rules:

154
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:23,889
Rule number 1.

155
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,990
Do something every day.

156
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,190
Rule number 2.

157
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,269
Do something different every day.

158
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:30,600
Easy, right?

159
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,019
“But, but, I don’t have time!”

160
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:36,769
You don’t need much time.

161
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,790
If you have ten minutes a day, spend ten minutes
a day.

162
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,110
Of course, more is better, but be realistic.

163
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,050
Don’t say you’re going to spend an hour
a day on English listening practice unless

164
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,399
you’re sure you will do it!

165
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,410
A good target is 15-20 minutes a day.

166
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,300
This is not too much, so it should be easy
to stick to.

167
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,350
It’s also enough to get better and improve.

168
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,360
What about the second rule?

169
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,860
You need to do something different every day
so that you listen to different sources and

170
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,679
different voices.

171
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,889
If you do the same thing every day, you won’t
get enough variety.

172
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:21,660
Here’s what your listening plan for one
week could look like:

173
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:29,350
Monday: listen to 1-2 songs, 2-3 times each.

174
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,660
Tuesday: listen to a podcast with American
voices.

175
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:41,529
Wednesday: watch 15 minutes of a TV show from
the UK.

176
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:46,449
Thursday: do a listening exercise from a textbook.

177
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:56,160
Friday: watch 15 minutes of a news show
Saturday: watch 15 minutes of an old movie

178
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:04,230
Sunday: call a friend and spend 15 minutes
speaking in English!

179
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,489
This is just an example.

180
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:08,559
Your plan might be different.

181
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,439
That’s fine!

182
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,629
Here are some questions you probably have:

183
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:15,810
“Where do I get materials?”

184
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,790
Easy, get on Google or the search engine of
your choice.

185
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,660
There’s lots of stuff out there which is
free if you have an Internet connection.

186
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,850
Yes, you have to work a little to find materials
that will suit you.

187
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,779
That’s necessary, because you should choose
your own listening materials.

188
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:37,499
“How do I choose something which is the
right level?”

189
00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:42,369
There’s a good rule here: the first time
you listen to something, you should be able

190
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:47,480
to understand more than 50% and less than
90%.

191
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,509
If you can’t understand half of what you
hear the first time you listen, then it’s

192
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:53,930
too difficult.

193
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,920
If you can understand more than 90% the first
time you listen, then it’s too easy.

194
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,110
So, try to choose materials which are in this
range.

195
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:08,949
“How do I stick to my plan and make sure
I don’t give up?”

196
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:11,600
Make your plan at the start of the week.

197
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,740
Write it down.

198
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,190
Stick it somewhere in your home, for example
on the wall, or on your fridge.

199
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,319
Think about what time of day you should do
your English practice.

200
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:24,619
Are you better in the mornings or in the evenings?

201
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:29,119
Try to do your listening practice when your
brain is at its best!

202
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:35,749
Then, when you do your listening practice
each day, cross it off your plan.

203
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,870
That way, you’ll see what you’re doing
every day.

204
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,009
You won’t want to miss a day!

205
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:45,779
If you have good ideas for things to listen
to in English, please share your suggestions

206
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,700
with other English learners in the video comments.
