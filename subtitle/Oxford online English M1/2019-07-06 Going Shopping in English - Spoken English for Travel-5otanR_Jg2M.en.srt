00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,460
Hi, I’m Marie.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,960
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,300
In this lesson, you can learn useful language
for going shopping in English.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,621
You’ll see how to ask for things you want,
how to talk about prices and discounts, how

5
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:20,900
to arrange delivery, and how to take something
back to a shop.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,230
Before we start, don’t forget to visit our
website: Oxford Online English dot com.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,890
Do you need to improve your English?

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,879
We have lots of resources for you: free video
lessons, quizzes, free listening lessons,

9
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:36,780
and more!

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,989
We also have many professional teachers who
offer online classes; you can improve your

11
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:49,800
spoken English, learn about English grammar,
or prepare for IELTS with one of our teachers.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:57,160
But now, let’s see how you can use English
when you go shopping.

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,120
Hello, do you need any help?

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,100
Yes, I’ve found this blue jacket, but I
can only find L and XL sizes.

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,240
Do you have it in a medium?

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,020
I’m afraid we’re sold out, but we do have
the same style in brown.

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,480
It’s just over here.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,080
Ah…

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,939
Yes, that’s nice, too, but I really like
the blue.

20
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:18,630
Will you be getting any more in?

21
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,880
Unfortunately not.

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,909
It’s the end of the season, so we’re getting
some new styles in from next week.

23
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:27,710
The ones you see here are the last we have
in stock.

24
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,649
If you want, you could check our website;
it might be possible to order it online.

25
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:37,509
Thanks, but I need something for a party this
weekend, plus I don’t like to buy clothes

26
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:39,280
without trying them on first.

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,400
Sure, I understand.

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,530
Would you like to try the brown one on?

29
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,170
Yes, sure.

30
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,190
Where do I go?

31
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,850
The changing rooms are just over there.

32
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:55,030
In the dialogue, you heard some useful language
related to buying clothing.

33
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,799
If you can’t find what you need in a shop,
what could you say?

34
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,560
In the dialogue, you heard, ‘Do you have
it in a medium?’

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,890
You could use this question in other ways.

36
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,420
For example: ‘Do you have this in a small?’

37
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,310
‘Do you have this top in green?’

38
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,190
You could also use ‘I’m looking for…’
to say what you want.

39
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,760
For example: ‘I’m looking for a formal
dress to wear to a wedding.’

40
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,180
Or: ‘I’m looking for some running shoes.’

41
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,940
Next, look at three phrases from the dialogue.

42
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,300
Could you explain what they mean?

43
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:44,370
‘Sold out’ means that they’ve sold everything,
so this product isn’t available any more.

44
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,459
For example, if you say that ‘Tickets for
the concert have sold out’, you mean that

45
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:55,740
all the tickets have been sold, and you can’t
buy tickets now.

46
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,700
‘Get in’ is a phrasal verb which can mean
‘have a product delivered’.

47
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:06,110
It’s generally used to talk about shops
and products which they sell.

48
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:12,040
For example, a shop assistant might say, ‘We’re
getting more sizes in next Monday.’

49
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,430
That means that new products will be delivered
next Monday, and you’ll be able to find

50
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,720
a wider range of sizes.

51
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,200
‘In stock’ means available, so you can
buy the thing.

52
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,409
The opposite is ‘out of stock’.

53
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:32,379
If a shop assistant says ‘We’re out of
stock at the moment’, he or she is telling

54
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,659
you that the product isn’t available.

55
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:46,790
Next, let’s see how you can talk about prices,
deals and discounts when shopping.

56
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,790
Excuse me?

57
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,790
Yes?

58
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,579
I’m interested in buying these chairs, but
I can’t see a price tag.

59
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,890
Can you tell me how much they are?

60
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,410
Sure, let me check…

61
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,110
] Forty-nine ninety-nine each, or one hundred
and eighty-five ninety-nine for the set of

62
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,140
four.

63
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,480
That seems strange.

64
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,099
I saw an advertisement that said they’re
buy one get one free.

65
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,099
Ah!

66
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:11,430
That’s a different product.

67
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,410
I know the ones you mean; they’re just over
here.

68
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,410
Right!

69
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,630
That’s what I was looking for.

70
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,440
So, how much are these?

71
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,900
One is seventy-nine ninety-nine, or two nine
nine ninety-nine for a set of four.

72
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,600
Of course, with the buy one get one offer,
you can buy two for seventy-nine ninety-nine,

73
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,790
or four for… what would that be?

74
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,140
One sixty.

75
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,140
Perfect!

76
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,470
I’ll take the set of four.

77
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,590
What do I do?

78
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,020
Is there a catalogue number?

79
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,210
Yes, just write down the number which is here,
or take a picture with your phone.

80
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,910
Pay at the cash register, then go to the collection
point to get your products.

81
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,980
I almost forgot: I have a loyalty card.

82
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,340
Does that mean I get a 5% discount?

83
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,970
Normally, yes, but your loyalty discount can’t
be used with other offers like this.

84
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,320
Yeah, that’s what I thought.

85
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,670
Anyway, thanks for your help!

86
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:09,330
If you want to know how much something costs,
you can ask a simple question: ‘How much

87
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,690
is…?’ or ‘How much are…?’

88
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,540
For example: ‘How much are these shoes?’

89
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,140
‘How much is this tablet?’

90
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:27,200
You could also ask in a slightly more formal
way, as in: ‘Can you tell me how much … are?’

91
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,600
or ‘Can you tell me how much … is?’

92
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,620
For example: ‘Can you tell me how much these
trousers are?’

93
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,080
‘Can you tell me how much this electric
toothbrush is?’

94
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:47,960
In spoken English, people sometimes don’t
read full numbers, especially numbers between

95
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,880
one hundred and one thousand.

96
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,200
Instead, they break the number into parts.

97
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:00,640
So, instead of ‘four hundred (and) forty-nine’,
you might hear ‘four-four-nine’.

98
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,720
This doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s
not unusual, either.

99
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,600
For numbers above one thousand, the number
is often broken into two parts.

100
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:17,710
So, instead of ‘one thousand two hundred
(and) seventy-five’, you might hear ‘twelve

101
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,990
seventy-five’, or even ‘twelve seven five’.

102
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:28,180
In the dialogue, the shop assistant said that
a set of four chairs would cost two nine nine

103
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,710
ninety-nine.

104
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,340
Two nine nine ninety-nine.

105
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,650
What does this mean?

106
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,540
Can you write down the number?

107
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,060
Let’s do some more practice with this quickly.

108
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:46,470
You’re going to hear five prices, which
might use the conversational style you just

109
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,470
saw.

110
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,090
After you hear each price, pause the video
and write down the number.

111
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,480
You’ll see the answers at the end.

112
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,660
Ready?

113
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,800
Let’s start!

114
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,500
Three-two-five fifty.

115
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,990
Fifteen sixty-nine.

116
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,810
Ten ninety-nine.

117
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,220
Eight eight eight thirty.

118
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,620
Two four nine nine.

119
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,620
How was that?

120
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,620
Difficult?

121
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,330
If so, don’t worry!

122
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,000
Rewind the video and listen once more.

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,690
You’ll see the answers in a second.

124
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,740
How did you do?

125
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,130
Could you hear the prices correctly?

126
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:38,720
Understanding numbers, especially when people
read the numbers in this conversational way,

127
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,360
can really help you when you’re shopping
in an English-speaking country.

128
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:52,800
Next, let’s look at another common task
when you’re shopping: arranging delivery.

129
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Yes, can I help?

130
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,880
Well…

131
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,800
I’ve just bought this TV…

132
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,180
Yes?

133
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,200
And…

134
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,660
It’s much bigger than I expected.

135
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,400
I’m not sure it’ll fit in my car.

136
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,500
Do you offer a delivery service?

137
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,900
Yes, of course!

138
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,780
I’m surprised they didn’t mention it to
you when you paid.

139
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,200
That’s great!

140
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,700
So, what do I do?

141
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,000
Can I take your receipt, please?

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Of course; here you are.

143
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,500
Let me see…

144
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,700
The earliest we could deliver it would be
next Wednesday.

145
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,000
Does that work for you?

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,100
I’m at work during the week.

147
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,800
Do you deliver at weekends?

148
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,800
We can deliver on Saturdays, but there’s
a four-pound charge.

149
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
That’s fine.

150
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,140
So, next Saturday, the 29th?

151
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,840
That works, but what time will it be?

152
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,580
We deliver between ten AM and four PM.

153
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:44,089
You can’t give me a more specific time than
that?

154
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,740
I’m afraid not.

155
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,050
All of our delivery slots are six hours.

156
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,290
I guess I’ll have to take it, then.

157
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,140
OK, so you just need to pay the weekend delivery
charge, and then we can set everything up

158
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,960
for you.

159
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,120
Can I pay by card?

160
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,220
Of course.

161
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:04,050
Of course, it’s more common nowadays to
order things online and have them delivered

162
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,050
to your home.

163
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:13,459
But maybe you want to see your new TV screen
in action, try out your new sofa, or check

164
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:17,140
that your new table will match your living
room.

165
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,110
In this case, you might need to arrange a
delivery in the shop.

166
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,000
To do this, you could ask: ‘Can I have this
delivered?’

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,620
‘Do you offer a delivery service?’

168
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,240
‘Can you deliver this to my house?’

169
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,199
Quick quiz: you heard one of these three questions
in the dialogue.

170
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:41,779
Which one?

171
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,420
You heard the second one.

172
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,259
However, they all have the same meaning.

173
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,029
You can use any of them!

174
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:54,129
You might also need to ask more specific questions
about the delivery, like: ‘Do you deliver

175
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:56,100
at weekends?’

176
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,020
‘What time will it be?’

177
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,300
‘Do you have any slots available next Friday?’

178
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,480
‘Does weekend delivery cost extra?’

179
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,310
What does that word ‘slot’ mean?

180
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,860
A ‘slot’ is a time period when something
can happen.

181
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:21,310
Often, a shop or company will give you a delivery
slot, for example from nine in the morning

182
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,829
to two in the afternoon.

183
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:29,480
You know your delivery will arrive sometime
in that window, but you don’t know exactly

184
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,880
when.

185
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,680
Now, you can ask about availability, ask about
prices, and arrange a delivery if you need

186
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,600
it.

187
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:46,900
But, what if you have a problem with something
you bought in a shop?

188
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,660
Hello, what can I do for you?

189
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,200
Hi, yes, I bought these jeans last week, and
I’d like to return them.

190
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:54,209
Do you have your receipt?

191
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:56,310
Yes, here you are.

192
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,180
Was anything wrong with the jeans?

193
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,029
No, no problem, they’re just the wrong size.

194
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:02,149
They’re too small.

195
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:04,779
Would you like to exchange them for a larger
size?

196
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,850
I can check if we have them in stock.

197
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,850
No, thank you.

198
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,939
I decided that I don’t like the style so
much, either.

199
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:12,790
Is it possible to get a refund?

200
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,029
Of course.

201
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:15,620
Do you have the card you paid with?

202
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,160
Can’t I get cash?

203
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,620
I’m sorry, but we can only issue a refund
to the card you paid with.

204
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,499
Alternatively, we can offer you gift vouchers
for the same amount.

205
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,380
Fine, put it on the card, then.

206
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,420
No problem.

207
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,260
At the start of the dialogue, you heard: ‘I
bought these jeans last week, and I’d like

208
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:36,329
to return them.’

209
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,499
‘Return’ could mean different things.

210
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:44,880
Generally, you can *replace* something, meaning
you get another of the same thing.

211
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,500
For example, if you buy a new phone, and it
doesn’t work when you take it out of the

212
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:57,310
box, you might ask to replace it—you get
a new version of the same phone.

213
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,660
You could also ask to *exchange* the product
you bought, meaning you give back the one

214
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,320
you bought, and take a different one, instead.

215
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,600
Maybe you bought some clothes, but then you
decided they don’t look as good as you hoped,

216
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,060
and you want to take something different.

217
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,240
Finally, you can ask for a refund, and get
your money back.

218
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,670
When you take something back to a shop, you
might hear questions like: ‘Do you have

219
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,960
your receipt?’

220
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:33,040
‘Was anything wrong with …?’
‘Would you like to exchange it for something

221
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,900
else?’

222
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,120
Let’s do a quick practice.

223
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,930
Look at six answers, which belong with these
three questions.

224
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,240
Can you match the answers to the questions?

225
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,020
Pause the video and think about your answers.

226
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,060
Ready?

227
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,939
Let’s look!

228
00:12:55,939 --> 00:13:01,040
Remember that you can always go back and rewatch
the dialogues or any section of this video

229
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,380
if you need more practice with these words
and phrases.

230
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:11,010
Here’s a question for you: what do you like
or dislike most about going shopping?

231
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,220
Have you ever had a problem with something
you bought in a shop?

232
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,980
What happened?

233
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:21,860
Share your experiences in the comments, and
practise your written English!

234
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,620
Thanks for watching!

235
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:24,389
See you next time!
