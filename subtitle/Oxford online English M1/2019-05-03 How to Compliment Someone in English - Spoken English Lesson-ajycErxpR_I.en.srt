00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Hi, I’m Gina.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,720
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,440
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to compliment
someone in English.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,870
If you like someone’s clothes, or you’re
invited to someone’s home and want to tell

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,360
them how nice it is, would you know what to
say?

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,160
Compliments—when you say something nice
to someone—are important if you want to

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,250
seem friendly.

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,369
However, the tone of compliments is important.

9
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:31,510
You can sound strange if you get it wrong.

10
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,430
In this class, you’ll see how to compliment
people in a natural way in English!

11
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:44,219

14
00:00:52,970 --> 00:01:02,060
But now, let’s start by looking at how you
can compliment someone’s appearance in English.

15
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,980
Is that a new top?

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,640
It looks really nice!

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Thanks!

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,970
Where did you get it?

19
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,490
That colour suits you.

20
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,640
Actually, I got it from a market.

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,390
I have no idea where it came from originally.

22
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,430
Did you get your hair cut?

23
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,430
Yeah!

24
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,430
I like it.

25
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,980
Shorter hair looks good on you!

26
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,220
Thanks!

27
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:28,590
A common way to compliment someone’s appearance
is to notice something new about them.

28
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,670
For example: ‘Is that a new top?’

29
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,549
‘Did you get your hair cut?’

30
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:42,560
You heard these in the dialogue, but you could
also say: ‘Are those shoes new?’

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,120
‘You look nice.

32
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,250
Have you lost weight?’

33
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,380
Of course, you should be careful when you
comment on someone’s weight or body shape.

34
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,689
It’s safer to avoid such comments with people
you don’t know well.

35
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:04,140
You can also say that someone looks good with
phrases like these: ‘It looks really nice.’

36
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,930
‘That colour suits you.’

37
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,160
‘Shorter hair looks good on you.’

38
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,959
You can use these phrases
in different ways.

39
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,650
For example: ‘Your shoes look really nice.’

40
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,739
‘That jacket suits you.’

41
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,290
‘Green looks good on you.’

42
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,120
You can use a colour like this to refer to
clothing.

43
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,819
So, you can say ‘red looks good on you,’
meaning that red clothes look good when you

44
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:39,120
wear them.

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,090
Of course, appearance isn’t everything!

46
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,610
Maybe you want to compliment others on their
personalities, too.

47
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:50,680
Let’s see how you can do this.

48
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,160
Wow!

49
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
Look at this.

50
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,989
You’re so organised.

51
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:56,709
How do you keep everything so tidy?

52
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:57,900
I don’t know.

53
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,269
I’ve always been tidy, I think.

54
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:01,960
I wish I was like that.

55
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,180
My office is always in a mess.

56
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,709
I like how patient you are.

57
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:09,569
It’s important for someone in your position.

58
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:10,870
Well, thanks for saying so.

59
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,319
I don’t know how you do it sometimes.

60
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,280
The way I see it is: you don’t gain anything
by getting angry or stressed.

61
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,510
I appreciate that you were so honest about
this.

62
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,330
Not everybody would have handled things the
same way.

63
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,489
It just seemed like the right thing to do.

64
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:31,190
Sure, but I still think it was brave of you
to speak out.

65
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,880
You can compliment someone’s personality
in a very simple way.

66
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,099
You heard: ‘You’re so organised.’

67
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,680
You can use this with other adjectives; for
example: ‘You’re so generous!’

68
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,660
‘You’re so hard-working.’

69
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,590
You can also use other phrases, such as: ‘I
like how patient you are.’

70
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,970
‘I appreciate that you were so honest about
this.’

71
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,790
‘It was brave of you to speak out.’

72
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:10,520
Again, you can use these in different ways,
like this: ‘I like how cheerful you are.’

73
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:16,780
‘I appreciate that you always listen carefully
to everyone’s ideas.’

74
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,340
‘It was nice of you to bring a gift.’

75
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:28,229
OK, at this point, you’ve learned some language
to compliment someone’s appearance and personality.

76
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:31,110
We have an exercise for you!

77
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,020
Think of someone you know well.

78
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,540
This person could be your friend, family member,
or colleague.

79
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,860
Imagine you want to compliment this person
on his or her appearance and personality.

80
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,639
Can you make two sentences?

81
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,910
Pause the video, and say your sentences out
loud.

82
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,870
Could you remember what to say?

83
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,930
Remember, you can always go back and check
if you’ve forgotten something.

84
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:06,850
Next, let’s imagine that someone has invited
you to their home for the first time.

85
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:16,140
It’s good manners to compliment your host
on their home; lets see how you can do that.

86
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,080
Wow!

87
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,530
I love your living room.

88
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,220
It’s so cosy!

89
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,310
Thanks!

90
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,910
It didn’t look like this when we moved in,
but we’ve done a lot of work on it.

91
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,710
I especially like that lamp.

92
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,360
Did it come with the place?

93
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,479
No, it was a wedding present.

94
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,290
I don’t know where it came from.

95
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,560
It’s really colourful.

96
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,430
You have a very nice place.

97
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,610
Thank you!

98
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,460
I like how spacious it is.

99
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,521
I live in the centre, and my apartment is
a shoebox.

100
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:47,770
Yeah, I guess that’s the plus of living
in the suburbs.

101
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,900
It’s much further away, though.

102
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,520
True.

103
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,430
If you want to compliment someone on their
home, you could make a general comment, like:

104
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,540
‘You have a very nice place.’

105
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,139
‘I like how spacious it is.’

106
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:06,210
You heard these in the dialogue, but you could
also say:

107
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,169
‘You have a very beautiful home.’

108
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:13,140
‘I like how bright your apartment is.’

109
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,569
You could also compliment specific things
about someone’s home.

110
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:20,520
In the dialogue, you heard: ‘I love your
living room.

111
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,300
It’s so cosy!’

112
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,520
‘I especially like that lamp.’

113
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Here’s a question for you: what other adjectives
could you use to compliment someone’s home?

114
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:43,199
There are many possible answers, but you could
use words like ‘warm’, ‘modern’, ‘beautiful’,

115
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,360
‘airy’ or ‘stylish’.

116
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,400
So, you might say: ‘I love your terrace!

117
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,220
It’s beautiful.’

118
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,910
‘I especially like your sofa.

119
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,920
It’s so stylish.’

120
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,320
If you’re at someone’s home, there’s
a good chance they’ll serve you food.

121
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:10,700
For our next topic, let’s see how you can
compliment someone’s cooking!

122
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,540
This soup is amazing!

123
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,720
What’s in it?

124
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,810
It’s a Caribbean recipe, with vegetables,
beef stock, coconut and thyme.

125
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,610
It’s so tasty!

126
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,410
Quite spicy, though.

127
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,610
Mmm, well…

128
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,720
It does have a couple of habanero peppers
in, too.

129
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,200
Maybe I should have warned you…

130
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Mmm!

131
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,860
The pizza is delicious!

132
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,430
Did you make it from scratch?

133
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,430
I did!

134
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,449
Glad you like it.

135
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:37,970
You even make the dough yourself?

136
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,970
Yep.

137
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,490
It’s not so difficult, actually, and I think
the end result is better.

138
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,620
Do you want more?

139
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,180
Yes, please!

140
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:52,509
To compliment someone’s cooking, you can
use words like ‘tasty’ or delicious’.

141
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:59,379
You can also use more general adjectives,
like ‘amazing’, ‘great’ or ‘fantastic’.

142
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:05,200
For example, you could say: ‘This soup is
amazing.’

143
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,900
‘The pasta is really tasty.’

144
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,420
‘I love the pie.

145
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,759
It’s fantastic!’

146
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,470
‘The potatoes are delicious.’

147
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,220
As you heard before, part of complimenting
something is showing an interest.

148
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,680
So, you can ask questions like: ‘What’s
in it?’

149
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,960
‘Did you make it from scratch?’

150
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,190
‘You even make the dough yourself?’

151
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:38,010
If you make something from scratch, you don’t
use any pre-made ingredients.

152
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:44,850
For example, if you make a pizza from scratch,
then you make everything yourself: you mix

153
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:51,899
flour and water to make the dough, you make
the tomato sauce yourself, and so on.

154
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,300
Now, you should know several ways to compliment
someone in English.

155
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,960
For homework, go out and say something nice
to someone!

156
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,459
Thanks for watching!

157
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,220
See you next time!
