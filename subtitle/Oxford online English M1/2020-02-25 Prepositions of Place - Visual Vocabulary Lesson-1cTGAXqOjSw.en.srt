Hi, I’m Kasia.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,040
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,020
In this lesson, you can learn about prepositions
of place in English.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,590
You can see how to use several different prepositions
and prepositional phrases to say where something

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,920
is.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,760
In this video, we won’t go into detail on
the prepositions ‘at’, ‘on’ and ‘in’.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,460
We’ll make a separate video for these three,
because that’s a big topic by itself.

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,460
Maybe we’ve already published the video
– check our channel to see if it’s there!

Ready to start?

16
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,720
Let’s see how to use prepositions of place
in English.

17
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,720
The egg is in the bowl.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,120
Or, the egg is inside the bowl.

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,400
The egg is on top of the bowl.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,630
‘In’ and ‘inside’ generally have the
same meaning.

21
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,180
If you can choose, then it’s better to use
‘in’.

22
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:36,280
Use ‘inside’ when you want to emphasise
that something is surrounded on all sides

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,031
For example,
Inside an egg, you can find two parts: the

24
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:50,930
white and the yolk
The egg is in front of the bowl.

25
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,050
The egg is behind the bowl.

26
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:03,440
The egg is on the left of the bowl
The egg is on the right of the bowl.

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,640
You can also say ‘to the left’ or ‘to
the right’.

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:14,800
There’s no difference in meaning
The egg is next to the bowl.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,920
The egg is near the bowl.

30
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,740
‘Next to’ and ‘near’ are similar,
but not the same.

31
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,200
‘Next to’ is more precise.

32
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,680
If you say ‘The egg is next to the bowl’,
you mean that there isn’t much space between

33
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,100
the bowl and the egg.

34
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,480
They’re very close to each other.

35
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,099
‘Near’ is less precise.

36
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:41,430
If you say ‘The egg is near the bowl’,
you mean that there isn’t a lot of distance

37
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:47,290
between the bowl and the egg, but it doesn’t
tell you exactly how close they are.

38
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:52,680
You can also use ‘beside’ and ‘by’,
which are similar to ‘next to’.

39
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,540
‘Next to’ is more common in most situations.

40
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,879
So, you can say ‘The egg is next to the
bowl’.

41
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:05,389
Or, the egg is beside the bowl.

42
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:09,940
Or, the egg is by the bowl.

43
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:15,600
All three have the same meaning, although
in practice, you would probably always use

44
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:16,800
‘next to’.

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,290
If you’re not sure, use ‘next to’!

46
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,040
What about ‘near’?

47
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,140
‘Near’ could mean closer, or further away.

48
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:33,400
‘The egg is near the bowl’ could mean
that the egg is in many different positions.

49
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,120
The egg is between the bowls.

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,780
The egg is among the bowls.

51
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:49,680
‘Between’ and ‘among’ both have the
meaning of ‘in the middle of’ or ‘surrounded

52
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,279
by’
‘Between’ is more specific.

53
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:59,120
‘Between’ means in the middle of *two*
things.

54
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,960
‘Among’ means in the middle of many things.

55
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,520
He's holding the egg over the bowl.

56
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,040
He's holding the egg above the bowl.

57
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,240
He's holding the egg under the bowl.

58
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,020
He's holding the egg below the bowl.

59
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,140
‘Over’ and ‘above’ are similar as
prepositions of place.

60
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,020
Often, you can use either preposition, and
the meaning is the same.

61
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:33,820
Be careful; if you’re talking about *movement*,
then ‘over’ and ‘above’ are different.

62
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,020
‘Over’ and ‘under’ are opposites.

63
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,840
‘Above’ and ‘below’ are opposites.

64
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,760
Like ‘over’ and ‘above’, ‘under’
and ‘below’ are often the same.

65
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,400
‘Often’ the same?

66
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,560
So, when are they different?

67
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,500
There’s one important difference.

68
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:00,860
If something completely covers something else,
you can only use ‘over’ and ‘under’.

69
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,120
He put the bowl over the egg.

70
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,670
The egg is under the bowl.

71
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:15,340
You need to use ‘over’ and ‘under’
because the bowl covers the egg completely.

72
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,000
The bowls are opposite each other.

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,220
Use ‘opposite’ when two things are on
different sides of something else.

74
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:31,780
For example, if you’re sitting at a table,
and I’m sitting on the other side, facing

75
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,610
you, then we’re sitting *opposite* each
other.

76
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:43,380
You can also say ‘across from’, which
is more conversational but has the same meaning.

77
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,120
That’s the end of the lesson.

78
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,190
Thanks for watching!
