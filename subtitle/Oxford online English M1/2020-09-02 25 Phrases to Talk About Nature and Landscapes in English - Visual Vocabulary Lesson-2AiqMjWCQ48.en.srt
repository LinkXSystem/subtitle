00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,860
Hi, I’m Martin.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,440
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,680
In this visual vocabulary lesson, you can
learn to describe landscapes, countryside

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,400
nature in English.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,020
What does the countryside look like near your
home?

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,410
What kind of landscapes does your country
have?

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:29,260
Let’s see how you can answer these questions.

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,390
I grew up in a small village in England.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,329
The countryside around there is very typically
English: there are fields separated by stone

10
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:46,940
walls or hedgerows, and rolling hills in the
distance.

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:54,340
A ‘hedge’ is something like a wall, or
a fence, but made out of plants.

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:00,340
A ‘hedgerow’ is similar, but it’s used
as a barrier between fields.

13
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,560
In Britain, farm fields are often surrounded
by hedgerows.

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:15,440
‘Rolling hills’ means low hills with gentle
slopes.

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,500
When I was a student, I studied in Canada
for a year.

16
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,760
Although it wasn’t cold all year, my main
memory is of these bleak, wintry landscapes,

17
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,700
full of never-ending pine forests.

18
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,380
‘Wintry’ is the adjective from ‘winter’.

19
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:45,620
You heard ‘wintry landscapes’; another
common collocation is ‘wintry weather’.

20
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,840
‘Bleak’ means empty and cold.

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,140
It has a negative meaning.

22
00:01:52,140 --> 00:02:01,560
Bleak landscapes are not necessarily ugly,
but they’re often depressing.

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,900
After I graduated, I took a road trip across
the USA with a friend.

24
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,720
It was interesting to see how the landscape
changed as we drove.

25
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,580
A lot of the USA is quite flat.

26
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,940
There are these huge plains, which go on for
miles.

27
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:27,220
A ‘plain’ is a large, flat area of land
without trees.

28
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:34,780
You can also use the word ‘grassland’
for a flat area which is covered with grass.

29
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,280
Further south, we passed through mountainous
badlands.

30
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,200
The mountains there have this weird liquid
look, like someone

31
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,639
just poured them onto the land.

32
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,640
It was a barren region, but beautiful nonetheless.

33
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,660
Have you ever heard the word ‘badlands’?

34
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:02,980
It describes a specific type of landscape
which is made of soft rock which has been

35
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,200
shaped by erosion.

36
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:13,290
Badlands are generally quite bare – without
many plants or trees – and often have steep-sided

37
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,900
hills.

38
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,680
Before, I used the word ‘barren’.

39
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,950
Do you know what that means?

40
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,600
If something is barren, there are few plants
or trees.

41
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:35,440
You could also use the word ‘bare’, which
has a similar meaning here.

42
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,640
We drove through Utah and Monument valley.

43
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:48,000
It’s a rocky desert, with these incredible
mesas and weird rock formations, like nothing

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,320
I’ve seen elsewhere.

45
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:58,450
You can use the phrase ‘rock formation’
to refer to an interesting or unusual rock

46
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,580
structure.

47
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:11,060
One example is a mesa, which is a flat-topped
rock formation with steep sides.

48
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,140
In California, we visited the redwood forests.

49
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,359
Of course, we have forests and woodland in
England, but nothing like this.

50
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,000
The trees are enormous!

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,310
You can use different words for land which
is covered with trees.

52
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,840
You heard ‘forest’ and ‘woodland’.

53
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:41,199
If you’re talking about a tropical forest,
you can say ‘rainforest’ or ‘jungle’.

54
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,090
You might also hear ‘wood’, as in ‘There’s
a small wood next to the river.’

55
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:52,870
Technically, a forest is bigger than a wood,
but English speakers sometimes use the words

56
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,040
interchangeably.

57
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:03,180
We finished in Yosemite National Park, which
is one of the most stunning places I’ve

58
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,460
ever visited.

59
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,800
The highlight was this towering waterfall.

60
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:17,680
You can use the word ‘towering’ to describe
natural features which are tall and impressive.

61
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,590
‘Towering’ is usually a positive adjective.

62
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:30,190
You can have ‘towering mountains’, ‘towering
cliffs’, or ‘towering trees.’

63
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:36,580
Now, I live in Germany, in a small town on
the banks of a river.

64
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:43,380
The countryside is quite similar to England,
with fields, forests, and lots of greenery.

65
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,320
It’s pretty, at least, when the weather’s
nice!

66
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:55,660
Here’s a question: what’s the difference
between ‘bank’, ‘shore’ and ‘coast’?

67
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:02,200
They all mean a place where the land meets
the water, but they’re not exactly the same.

68
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,460
Do you know the difference?

69
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,080
Generally, you use ‘bank’ for the sides
of rivers.

70
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:18,760
‘Shore’ is mostly for lakes; ‘coast’
is for where the land meets the sea or the

71
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:25,620
ocean, although ‘shore’ is also possible
in some contexts.

72
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,320
Another useful word you heard here is ‘greenery’.

73
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,360
‘Greenery’ means plants in general.

74
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:40,660
It could mean grass, flowers, trees, bushes,
or a mix.

75
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:47,340
If you come to Germany, you should try to
visit Neuschwanstein castle.

76
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,060
It’s in a beautiful setting, perched in
the mountains.

77
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:58,500
The landscape all around is incredibly rugged
and dramatic.

78
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:05,050
If you want to describe mountainous terrain
which is very steep and rocky, you can use

79
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,960
the word ‘rugged’.

80
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,620
You can also say ‘rugged coastline’.

81
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:20,360
If you describe landscape as ‘dramatic’,
you mean that it’s impressive and beautiful.

82
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:29,030
It’s often used for wilder, more remote
landscapes, like high mountains.

83
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:35,760
I like where I live, but my dream is to start
my own business and work online, so I could

84
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:45,780
live by the sea, maybe on a Greek island,
with sandy beaches and clear, turquoise water.

85
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,060
‘Turquoise’ is a colour between blue and
green.

86
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:56,940
It’s not that common in everyday conversation,
but if you use it to describe water or the

87
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:03,310
sea, you usually mean that the water looks
beautiful.

88
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,740
What about you?

89
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,760
If you live in a city, what’s the surrounding
countryside like?

90
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,800
Are there forests, fields, or mountains?

91
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,460
Do you live near the coast?

92
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,520
If you live in the countryside, describe it!

93
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,640
Look out of your window; what does the landscape
look like?

94
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,840
Think about your answer.

95
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,660
You can write it down, say it out loud, or
put it in the video comments.

96
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,260
Or, do all three!

97
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,310
That’s all.

98
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,870
Thanks for watching!
