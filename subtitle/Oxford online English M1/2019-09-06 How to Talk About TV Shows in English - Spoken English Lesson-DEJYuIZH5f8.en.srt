00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,150

Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:11,389
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to talk
about TV and TV shows in English.

4
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:13,650
Do you watch TV?

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,590
How and where?

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,260
What kind of shows do you like or dislike?

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,400
You’ll see how to answer these questions
and more in clear, detailed English.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,500

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,600
Now, let’s get back to our topic.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,510
Here’s a question: how much TV do you watch?

15
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,740
Do you watch much TV?

16
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,200
Not really.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,900
I used to, but now I’m too busy, and I don’t
have the time.

18
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,040
Sometimes I put something on in the background
while I’m doing other things, like cooking

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,700
or cleaning.

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,860
You?

21
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,210
I go through phases.

22
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,280
Sometimes I get really into a show, and I
binge-watch it over a few days, or I’ll

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,890
have weeks where I watch a lot of TV in the
evenings.

24
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,720
But, at some point, I get tired of it and
I take a break for a few weeks.

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,160
So you’re either watching TV all the time,
or not at all?

26
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,560
I guess!

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,280
I get addicted to things easily.

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,470
I’ve never really understood the whole binge-watching
thing.

29
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,400
I’ve never been *that* into a show.

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,659
I can watch one, two episodes of something,
but then I want to do something else.

31
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,750
That’s a better way to do it.

32
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,770
It’s fun to watch a really good show, but
sometimes I feel guilty, like I could be doing

33
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,680
something better with my time.

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,740
Yeah.

35
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,920
Do you watch much TV?

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,340
In the dialogue, you heard several phrases
you can use to talk about your TV-watching

37
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,700
habits.

38
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,380
Look at four sentences.

39
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,840
Do you know what these mean?

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,160
Are any of them true for you?

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,720
‘Go through phases’ is a general phrase.

42
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:29,700
You can use it to talk about many things.

43
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,260
It means that you have times where you do
something a lot, and then times when you don’t

44
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,660
do it much.

45
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,670
So, if you say ‘I go through phases’,
and you’re talking about watching TV, you

46
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:48,510
mean that there are times when you watch TV
regularly, and times you don’t.

47
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,959
Maybe one month you watch a lot of TV, but
the next month, you hardly watch any.

48
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,430
If you ‘get into’ something, then you
become really interested in it.

49
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,209
If you get into a TV show, you start watching
it, and then you like it and you want to watch

50
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:07,810
more.

51
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,400
You can use ‘get into’ for other things.

52
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,700
You could say ‘I got into photography when
I was a teenager’, meaning that you developed

53
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,099
a strong interest in photography at that time.

54
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,440
‘Binge-watch’ means that you watch a lot
of episodes of a TV show in a very short time.

55
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,540
Maybe you watch a whole season of a show in
one or two days.

56
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,820
A ‘binge’ has the idea of something unhealthy.

57
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:41,700
Finally, if you put something on in the background,
you aren’t really watching it.

58
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,460
Maybe you’re half-watching, or you’re
listening but not watching.

59
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,020
What about you?

60
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,930
Look at four questions:
Could you answer these questions?

61
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,549
Try it now!

62
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:59,440
Make sure you answer with a full sentence.

63
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,319
Try to use the language from the dialogue
and this section.

64
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:08,580
Pause the video and make your answers.

65
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,580
How was that?

66
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,310
Could you answer fluently?

67
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:17,820
If not, remember that you can always review
the dialogue and the section again.

68
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,200
Let’s look at our next topic.

69
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,120
Are you watching anything good at the moment?

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,569
I’m looking for a new show to watch.

71
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:30,789
There’s this medical drama I’ve been watching.

72
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:33,229
It’s on Wednesdays at nine o’clock.

73
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:34,619
You should check it out!

74
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:36,479
‘On Wednesdays’?

75
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,540
You mean on actual TV?

76
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,580
Yeah…

77
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,580
Wow!

78
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:44,419
You still watch broadcast TV?

79
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,880
I haven’t connected my TV aerial for years.

80
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,400
So, you just stream everything?

81
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah.

82
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:52,009
That’s weird.

83
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:56,580
I mean, no one I know watches broadcast TV
these days.

84
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,460
I guess I’m a bit old-fashioned.

85
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,249
I like having a choice of channels.

86
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:03,879
Mainly, I’m a big sports fan, so I get a
cable package.

87
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,059
That way, I can watch football and basketball
games live.

88
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:08,719
That makes sense.

89
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:16,499
Still, having to watch something at a specific
time seems so inconvenient.

90
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:20,499
I like being able to watch what I want when
I want.

91
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:24,909
I have a set-top recorder, so I can record
things and watch them later.

92
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:27,840
Plus, you can skip the ad breaks.

93
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,360
Ad breaks!

94
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,880
I had forgotten about those.

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,060
Most streaming services don’t have any ads.

96
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:40,069
So, you never stream things?

97
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:44,639
You’ve never used Hulu or Netflix or anything
like that?

98
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,639
No, never.

99
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,640
I just don’t have much interest.

100
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,060
Wow.

101
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,620
How do you generally watch TV?

102
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:56,599
In the dialogue, we talked about two different
ways to watch.

103
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:59,860
Do you remember?

104
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:06,050
You can watch broadcast TV, meaning traditional
TV where you choose a channel and watch programs

105
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:13,620
on a schedule, or you can watch TV on a streaming
service, like Netflix or Hulu.

106
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,980
You also heard some different advantages of
these two ways to watch TV.

107
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,979
Here’s a question: can you think of two
advantages of watching broadcast TV, and two

108
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:29,339
advantages of streaming?

109
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,760
In the dialogue, you heard these: ‘I like
having a choice of channels.’

110
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,880
‘I can watch football and basketball games
live.’

111
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,540
‘I like being able to watch what I want
when I want.’

112
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,080
‘Most streaming services don’t have any
ads.’

113
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,720
If you watch something live, you watch it
as it’s happening, in real time.

114
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,099
‘Ad’ is short for ‘advertisement’
or ‘advert’.

115
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:08,540
‘Ad’, ‘advert’ and ‘advertisement’
all have the same meaning.

116
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,689
Also, they’re all countable nouns.

117
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:19,900
Be careful not to mix these up with ‘advertising’
which is the abstract noun, and is uncountable.

118
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,939
Can you think of any other advantages of broadcast
TV or streaming services which weren’t mentioned

119
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:28,009
in the dialogue?

120
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:31,590
Try to think of one more advantage for each.

121
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,449
Pause the video if you want some thinking
time!

122
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,490
What did you think of?

123
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,529
Of course, there are many possibilities!

124
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,680
Here are four ideas.

125
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,920
Broadcast TV is usually free, because it’s
supported by advertising.

126
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,100
Broadcast TV has more news and current affairs
programs.

127
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,840
Streaming services produce their own exclusive
shows and films, which you can’t watch anywhere

128
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,330
else.

129
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:11,770
Many streaming services let you watch TV shows
from other countries and in other languages.

130
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,229
Did you get similar ideas?

131
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:19,110
Do you agree with these points, or not?

132
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,520
What about you?

133
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,919
Do you watch broadcast TV, streaming services,
or both?

134
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:28,339
Which is better for you, and why?

135
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:34,349
Pause the video and try to answer these questions
with at least three full sentences.

136
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:42,579
Take your time, and practise your answer several
times, until you can speak fluently.

137
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:44,169
Could you do it?

138
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:45,579
Great!

139
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:49,800
Let’s move on.

140
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,769
What kind of thing do you watch?

141
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:52,769
It depends.

142
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:59,500
Sometimes, if I’m tired at the end of the
day, I’ll just put on a sitcom, or a cookery

143
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,089
show or something.

144
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:06,240
If I want something more serious, I like drama
series, and some documentaries.

145
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,250
I like comedy a lot, too.

146
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,250
Do you ever watch stand-up?

147
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:16,820
No, mostly just sitcoms, and a few cartoons
like Bojack Horseman and things like that.

148
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,320
Bojack Horseman?

149
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,600
What’s that?

150
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,940
It’s a really dark animated comedy.

151
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,220
What’s it about?

152
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:33,320
It’s about a horse who used to be a famous
TV star, and it’s set in a world where animals

153
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:37,020
live together with people, and…

154
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,020
You know what?

155
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,660
It’s a little hard to explain.

156
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,480
But, it’s really good.

157
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,480
You should check it out.

158
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,820
Who’s in it?

159
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,170
Lots of people.

160
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:51,240
Will Arnett, who was in Arrested Development,
and Alison Brie.

161
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,610
A lot of other big-name actors, too.

162
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,640
Is it funny?

163
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,660
Yeah, it is, but it’s dark.

164
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,990
It’s quite sad sometimes.

165
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,990
Hmm…

166
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,629
Maybe I’ll take a look.

167
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:04,629
Where’s it on?

168
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:10,329
It’s a Netflix production, so I think you
can only watch it there.

169
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:15,410
In the dialogue, you heard several questions
you could use to ask someone about TV shows

170
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,870
they watch.

171
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,410
Look at the questions.

172
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,019
Can you complete the missing words?

173
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:28,470
Can you remember the answers, or can you work
them out?

174
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,670
Let’s look together.

175
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,520
Could you answer these questions for yourself?

176
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:42,500
We’ll look at how to answer in a minute;
first, let’s check the meaning of the questions.

177
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,089
What does ‘who’s in it?’ mean?

178
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:48,720
And what about ‘where’s it on?’

179
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,700
‘Who’s in it’ is asking about the actors.

180
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,000
You’re probably asking whether the show
has famous actors.

181
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,829
You can use the preposition ‘in’ to talk
about acting in a show or film.

182
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:07,860
For example, you can say: ‘He was in Arrested
Development,’ or ‘Robert de Niro was in

183
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,260
Heat.’

184
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:15,170
‘Where’s it on’ is asking about where
you can see something.

185
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:21,410
You can use the preposition ‘on’ to talk
about where or when a show is happening.

186
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,520
You can use it for other things, too, like
films at the cinema, plays at the theatre,

187
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,199
or concerts.

188
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:35,029
Now, think about the first question: what
kind of thing do you watch?

189
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:39,760
You could answer this by saying: ‘I mostly
watch crime series.’

190
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,980
‘I watch a mix of documentaries and medical
drama.’

191
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,520
‘I watch a bit of everything.’

192
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:50,170
What about you?

193
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,040
How would you answer this question?

194
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,190
Next, think of a show you really like.

195
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,629
Look at the questions from the dialogue.

196
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:07,490
We added some adjectives to the third question,
because you’ll need different ideas depending

197
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,480
on the show.

198
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,949
Can you make four sentences, answering these
questions, to talk about a show which you

199
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:15,480
like?

200
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,880
Let’s see a sample answer: ‘I’m watching
a sci-fi show called The Expanse.

201
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,810
It’s about human society in the future,
when people live all over the solar system,

202
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,220
and the tensions between different factions.

203
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,800
The main story is about the discovery of alien
life on one of Saturn’s moons.

204
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,410
It doesn’t have any big-name actors in it;
I haven’t seen most of the cast anywhere

205
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,589
else.

206
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:47,839
I think it’s quite original, although the
story takes some time to get really interesting.

207
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,480
I watched it on Netflix, but I think now it’s
only on Amazon video.’

208
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,209
What about you?

209
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:59,749
Try to make an answer like this, talking about
a TV show you like.

210
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:03,339
Use the questions to give your answer structure.

211
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:06,720
Either write your answer down, or say it out
loud.

212
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Or, do both!

213
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,310
Could you do it?

214
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,879
Try as many times as you like.

215
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:20,449
For now, let’s look at our last section.

216
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:23,260
Are you watching the new Game of Thrones season?

217
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,579
No, actually.

218
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:27,160
I gave up on it a while ago.

219
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,920
Why, is it good?

220
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,130
Yeah, I think so.

221
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,790
Where did you stop?

222
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,660
About two seasons ago.

223
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,860
I liked it at the beginning, but I felt like
it went downhill in later seasons.

224
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,740
Some storylines just made no sense, and there
was a lot of padding.

225
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,300
Really?

226
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,009
I think it’s just got better with time.

227
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:53,350
The season they’re making now is the last
one, and I think it’s the best yet.

228
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,899
The plot has so many great twists.

229
00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:00,949
Normally, I can guess where a story is going,
but with this, it’s full of surprises.

230
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:04,459
Personally, I thought it was quite predictable.

231
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:07,639
One problem was that it got too melodramatic.

232
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,829
Every episode finished with a huge cliffhanger,
like a bad soap opera.

233
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:16,269
Well, they had a lot of plot threads to resolve
from earlier.

234
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:18,709
I think they’re doing a good job with it.

235
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:22,959
I hate it when shows leave storylines hanging
and don’t explain things properly.

236
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,310
I am a little curious to see what happens
with some things, but probably not enough

237
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,560
to watch it again.

238
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,790
I can tell you if you…

239
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,780
No—no spoilers.

240
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,540
I might change my mind.

241
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,430
You should!

242
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:41,180
If you don’t like a TV show, what reasons
could you give?

243
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,759
You heard several points in the dialogue.

244
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,029
Do you remember them?

245
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:54,020
Look at some phrases you heard:
Could you explain the meaning of these?

246
00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:00,079
‘Go downhill’ is a conversational phrase
meaning ‘get worse’.

247
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,290
If you say ‘I liked it at the start, but
it went downhill later’, you’re saying

248
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:10,749
that the quality of the show got worse with
time.

249
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:15,370
If something makes no sense, it isn’t clear
or understandable.

250
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:21,249
If you say ‘some storylines made no sense’,
maybe you mean that the characters made unrealistic

251
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:28,400
decisions, or problems were solved in a very
unrealistic, fantastical way.

252
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,410
‘Padding’ means something which is added
just to fill time.

253
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,390
If a TV show has a lot of padding, there’s
a lot of empty content, which doesn’t add

254
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:42,600
to the story or the characters.

255
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,350
Of course, you could use these sentences in
different ways.

256
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,380
For example: ‘It went downhill after the
end of season one.’

257
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,320
‘Some storylines didn’t go anywhere.’

258
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,360
‘There was a lot of boring dialogue.’

259
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,640
Finally, let’s look at three more useful
words you saw in the dialogue.

260
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:08,269
Look at three sentences.

261
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:11,910
Can you explain the highlighted words?

262
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:17,540
A ‘cliffhanger’ is a dramatic ending to
an episode, where you really want to know

263
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,100
what happens next.

264
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:26,460
Often, a cliffhanger means that the episode
ends right in the middle of a key story moment.

265
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,680
‘Plot threads’ are like storylines.

266
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,770
Many TV shows have many characters and plot
threads, which go in parallel to each other.

267
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:41,920
Generally, you want a show to resolve all
its plot threads, meaning that every storyline

268
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,629
has an ending.

269
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:51,880
Otherwise, a bad show might leave storylines
hanging, meaning you never find out what happened.

270
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:58,160
Finally, a ‘spoiler’ is when someone tells
you about the story of a film or TV show before

271
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,730
you watch it.

272
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:06,260
Sometimes, TV reviews or articles will include
the words ‘spoiler alert’ at the beginning.

273
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,520
This is warning you that you shouldn’t read
it if you don’t want to find out the story

274
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,380
for yourself!

275
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,560
Here’s a final task for you.

276
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,380
Can you describe a TV show you really like?

277
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:24,909
Say what kind of show it is, what it’s about,
and why you like it.

278
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:29,190
Put your answer in the comments, and you can
get some feedback and corrections!

279
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,590
Thanks for watching!

280
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,590
See you next time!
