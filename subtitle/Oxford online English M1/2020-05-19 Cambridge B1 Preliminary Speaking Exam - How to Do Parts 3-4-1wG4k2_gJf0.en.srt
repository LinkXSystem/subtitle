1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,310
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,450
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:10,081
In this lesson, you can learn how to do parts
three and four of the Cambridge B1 Preliminary

4
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:11,500
speaking exam.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:18,859
Before we start, one question: do you find
it difficult to understand spoken English?

6
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:20,180
Yes?

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,060
Help yourself and turn on the subtitles now.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,180
All our videos have English subtitles; click
the CC button in the bottom right of your

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,190
video player to turn them on.

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:41,030
If you’re watching on a mobile phone, use
the settings icon at the top.

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:47,110
In part three of the B1 preliminary speaking
test you talk to your partner, not to the

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,530
examiner.

13
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,559
It lasts two to three minutes.

14
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:56,710
At the beginning, the examiner will say: “Now,
in this part of the test you’re going to

15
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,490
talk about something together for about two
minutes.

16
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,110
I’m going to describe a situation to you.”

17
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,360
Then, the examiner will give you a booklet
with the task.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,110
You’ll see several pictures.

19
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,340
It might look something like this.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,320
Then, you’ll hear the instructions.

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,000
For example: “A family wants to go on a
trip this weekend.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,939
Talk together about the different places the
family could visit and decide which trip the

23
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,920
family would most enjoy.

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,490
All right?

25
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,490
Now, talk together.”

26
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,580
Listen to the examiner carefully, because
the instructions won’t be written on the

27
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,680
task.

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,380
If anything is not clear, ask the examiner
to repeat the instructions.

29
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,270
First point: remember that the situation is
about other people, not about you.

30
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,820
This task is not asking you to describe where
*you* want to visit this weekend.

31
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:03,120
It is asking you to talk about where the *family
in the picture* should visit.

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,060
Don’t say ‘I think the castle is a good
idea because I love history.’

33
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:10,170
This trip is not for you.

34
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,440
You are only recommending ideas for the family.

35
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,160
Instead, say ‘I think the castle is a good
idea because it would be educational for the

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,620
family.’

37
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,370
Now let’s look at another situation.

38
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,400
Pause the video if you want more time to read
and think.

39
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,150
Remember also that the instructions will not
be written on the task in your real B1 speaking

40
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,200
exam!

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,320
Let’s look at how to begin.

42
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,030
Do you know how you should start?

43
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,620
A good way to start is to ask your partner
a question.

44
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:56,620
For example, for this task, you could ask
‘Which present do you think is the best?’

45
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,320
Or, ‘What do you think about getting him
a camera?’

46
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,080
Let’s look at another task.

47
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,660
Imagine you’re in the B1 speaking test.

48
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,040
This is your task.

49
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,430
Can you think of a question you could ask
your partner to start?

50
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:22,629
Pause the video and try to make one or two
questions you could use to start this task.

51
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:25,930
Do it now!

52
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,319
Could you do it?

53
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,299
Of course, there are many possibilities!

54
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:35,180
You could ask ‘What do you think about bringing
a camera?’

55
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,940
Or ‘Do you think they should bring a guidebook?’

56
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,620
Asking a question is a good way to start.

57
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:47,430
What next?

58
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,209
The conversation should be fifty per cent
you speaking and fifty per cent your partner

59
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,209
speaking.

60
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:57,739
You don’t get extra points for speaking
more.

61
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:03,060
Give your opinion about something, and then
ask your partner a question.

62
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:10,700
Your opinions on each idea should not be very
long – one or two sentences maximum – then

63
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,040
ask another question.

64
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,780
Ask your partner to respond to your ideas.

65
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,660
Let’s go back to our first example.

66
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,290
Remember: one or two sentences, then ask a
question.

67
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,850
For example: ‘I think going to the beach
is a good idea if the weather is nice because

68
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,750
the children could play in the sea.

69
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,380
What do you think about the family going to
the beach?’

70
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:46,430
Let’s move on to our next point: linking
your ideas when you speak.

71
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,500
In part three of the B1 speaking exam, you
need to link your ideas with comparisons and

72
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,080
contrasts.

73
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,840
Look at our second task again.

74
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,400
Imagine you’re in the exam.

75
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,250
Your partner says ‘I think the mobile phone
is a good idea because our classmate could

76
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,690
keep in contact with us.

77
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,610
What do you think about the camera?’

78
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,840
And then you reply ‘I don’t think the
camera is a good idea because cameras are

79
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,620
old-fashioned.

80
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,070
What do you think about the book?’

81
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:26,590
These are good answers and ideas, but as a
conversation, it sounds unnatural.

82
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,280
There’s no connection between one answer
and the other.

83
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,540
Here’s a better example.

84
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,400
Your partner says ‘I think the mobile phone
is a good idea because our classmate could

85
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,610
keep in contact with us.

86
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,290
What do you think about the camera?’

87
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:49,090
You reply ‘I don’t think the camera is
a good idea, because today all mobile phones

88
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,789
have cameras.

89
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:53,620
What do you think about the book?’

90
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,530
This sounds better, right?

91
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:01,080
Comparing and linking your ideas helps you
to sound more like you’re having a normal

92
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,039
discussion.

93
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,840
Our next point: you need to react to your
partner’s ideas and suggestions.

94
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,460
How can you do that?

95
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,389
When your partner speaks, you need to listen
actively.

96
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:17,180
Don’t just sit there like a robot.

97
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,400
React, nod your head, or say something to
show how you feel.

98
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,080
If you agree with what your partner says,
you could say something like: ‘I agree’,

99
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,449
‘good idea’, ‘that’s interesting’,
‘you’re right’, ‘that’s true’

100
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:38,170
or ‘I think so too’.

101
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,530
If you disagree with your partner, remember
to be polite.

102
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,110
You could say ‘really?’

103
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:52,410
‘I’m not sure about that’, ‘I don’t
think I agree’, ‘I don’t think so’

104
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,890
or ‘good idea, but I prefer…’

105
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:03,340
Also, when you disagree with your partner,
give a reason, or an alternative suggestion.

106
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,789
For example: if your partner says, ‘I think
the book is a good idea because books are

107
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:16,509
not that expensive’, and you disagree, you
could reply ‘I don’t think I agree.

108
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:22,090
I understand that a book would be a cheap
present, but we want to get our classmate

109
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:27,830
something special to remember us, like the
watch.’

110
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,840
When you’ve finished discussing your options,
you should make a decision together.

111
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,660
At the end, ask your partner something like
‘what have we decided?’ or ‘shall we

112
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,530
choose one?’

113
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,720
Remember: you don’t have to be honest.

114
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,800
If your partner thinks that one idea is better,
you can agree just to finish the conversation.

115
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,680
It doesn’t matter if you really agree or
not.

116
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,770
If your partner is unsure, try to lead the
decision.

117
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,750
Look at our first task.

118
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,110
You could say, ‘I think the family should
go to the beach, because we agreed it has

119
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,069
a lot of activities for all of the family.’

120
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:12,830
This shows that you have control over the
conversation.

121
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,520
What about our second task?

122
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,849
You could say, ‘I think we can agree that
the mobile phone is the best idea because

123
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:25,720
our classmate can keep in contact with us.’

124
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,270
Again, you’re controlling the discussion,
but also involving your partner.

125
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,159
Doing these things can help your score.

126
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:41,060
Make sure you leave enough time to reach a
final decision together, but you also need

127
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,760
to talk for the full two to three minutes.

128
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:53,160
If you stop too early, the examiner will not
say anything, and you will be sitting in uncomfortable

129
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,440
silence.

130
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,180
When preparing for the B1 speaking exam, try
to get a feeling for how long you need to

131
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,180
speak.

132
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,940
Don’t answer the question too quickly.

133
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:09,380
After around two and a half minutes, start
trying to reach a final decision.

134
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:15,760
Now, you should understand how to do part
three of the B1 Preliminary speaking exam.

135
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,580
What about part four?

136
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,149
In part four, the examiner will ask you questions,
and you’ll discuss the questions with your

137
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,730
partner.

138
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:33,120
This means you need to speak to both the examiner
and your partner in part four.

139
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,820
The questions will be on a similar topic to
part three.

140
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,480
Part four lasts around three minutes.

141
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,130
For example, if the topic in part three was
connected to travel, you might hear questions

142
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:52,440
like: ‘Do you prefer to travel with friends
or alone?’

143
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,560
‘What can people learn from travelling to
different countries?’

144
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,500
‘What do you like doing when you go on holiday?’

145
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,930
Think: how could you answer these questions?

146
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:11,910
Here’s a sample answer for the first question:
‘I prefer to travel with friends.

147
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,630
It’s more interesting.’

148
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,750
What do you think?

149
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,080
Good answer?

150
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,720
It’s not terrible, but it could be better.

151
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,940
This answer is just two short sentences, and
it doesn’t have many ideas.

152
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:34,480
First, try to join your ideas together using
words like ‘but’, ‘although’ or ‘because’.

153
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,000
For example: ‘I prefer to travel with friends,
because it’s more interesting.’

154
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,040
Next, try to use more specific vocabulary.

155
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,250
‘Interesting’ is very general.

156
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:53,200
For example: ‘I prefer to travel with friends,
because it’s more sociable.’

157
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,490
Then, try to add more ideas to your answer,
like this: ‘I prefer to travel with friends,

158
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:08,040
because it’s more sociable, plus you always
have people to talk to and hang out with.’

159
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:16,060
Remember these three points: join your ideas
together, use specific vocabulary, and add

160
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,350
ideas to your answer.

161
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,610
In this way, you can make your answers stronger!

162
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,050
Like in part three, you should ask your partner
for their opinions.

163
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,329
The examiner will ask questions in part four.

164
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:33,740
However, you should also talk to your partner.

165
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:39,519
So, at the end of your answer, you can ask
your partner a question like ‘How about

166
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,920
you?’ or ‘Do you agree?’

167
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,149
Also, react to what your partner says.

168
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:52,589
For example, imagine your partner says ‘People
can learn a lot from travelling to different

169
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:53,870
countries.

170
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,360
For example, they can see how things like
culture, food and architecture are different

171
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,120
around the world.’

172
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,540
How could you react to this?

173
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,180
First of all, you could agree or disagree.

174
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:15,460
For example, you could say, ‘Yes, I think
so, too’ or ‘I’m not sure I agree with

175
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,300
you.’

176
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,300
Even better, try to add your own ideas.

177
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,760
For example: ‘Yes, I think so, too.

178
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:30,480
Also, people can learn about different traditions,
for example how festivals are celebrated.’

179
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,810
Or, ‘I’m not sure I agree with you.

180
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,920
Travelling is a great experience, but I think
you can learn about other countries’ culture,

181
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,500
food and so on even if you don’t go there.’

182
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,460
Let’s try another one.

183
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,140
Imagine that your partner says: ‘When I’m
on holiday, I just like lying on the beach

184
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,240
and doing nothing all day.’

185
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
How could you respond to this?

186
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,200
Try to make two or three sentences.

187
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,310
Say if you have the same opinion, or not,
and add your own ideas.

188
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:07,339
Pause the video and say your response aloud.

189
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:08,760
Could you do it?

190
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,790
There are many possible answers.

191
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,070
Let’s look at two.

192
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,410
You could say ‘I’m the same way.

193
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:21,500
My work’s really busy, so when I’m on
holiday, I just want to relax and forget about

194
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,060
the stress of daily life.’

195
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,260
Or, you could say ‘I guess I’m quite different
to you.

196
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:36,700
I love active holidays, so I enjoy things
like hiking, rafting, cycling, and so on.

197
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,440
If I stayed on the beach all day, I’d get
really bored.’

198
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:49,180
In general, in part four, try to add reasons,
details and examples to your answers.

199
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:55,220
This will let you use a wider range of grammar
and vocabulary, which improves your score!

200
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,800
Let’s put these ideas together.

201
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,140
For each question the examiner asks, you should
do one of two things.

202
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:09,130
First, you can give your answer, then ask
your partner for their opinion.

203
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:13,790
You can also continue the discussion by reacting
to what your partner says.

204
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:19,380
Or, you can let your partner speak, and then
react to what they say.

205
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:25,060
A good idea would be to take turns, so that
you answer one question first, and then your

206
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,060
partner speaks first for the next question.

207
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,800
It’s better in part four if you and your
partner can control the discussion, rather

208
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,199
than waiting for the examiner to speak.

209
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,620
The examiner might stop you if you speak for
too long or go off-topic, but that’s not

210
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,560
a problem.

211
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,120
That’s it.

212
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:51,290
Good luck if you have a B1 Preliminary speaking
exam soon!

213
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,940
Thanks for watching!

214
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,570
See you next time!
