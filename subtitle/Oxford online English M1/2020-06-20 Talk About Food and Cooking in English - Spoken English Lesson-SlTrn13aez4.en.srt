00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,700
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,830
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

about food.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,750
You’ll see how to talk about different cuisines,
talk about food you like – or dislike – and

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,220
talk about cooking and eating habits.

13
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,280
What kind of food do you like?

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,879
I like a bit of everything, really.

15
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:59,659
I grew up in the UK, and you can get food
from all over the world there.

16
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:03,940
My mum’s cooking is a combination of different
cuisines: a bit of French, a bit of Italian,

17
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,250
a bit of Indian, and so on.

18
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,740
What’s British cuisine like?

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,640
I know about fish and chips, but there must
be more…

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,700
There is, but not that much.

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,159
There are a few famous dishes like shepherd’s
pie or Sunday roast, but most people eat a

22
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,700
mix of things.

23
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,700
What about you?

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,220
What food do you like?

25
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,990
I’m half Spanish, so when I was young we
ate a lot of Mediterranean food at home.

26
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,969
Now, I live in Berlin, and it’s a pretty
cosmopolitan place, so you can get all kinds

27
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:32,909
of food, like the UK, I suppose.

28
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,700
I’ve never really had much Spanish food.

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,340
Is it similar to Italian?

30
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,179
In some ways, yes.

31
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:43,290
They both use a lot of fresh ingredients,
and there’s a lot of seafood, salads, and

32
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,290
so on.

33
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,140
Pasta isn’t so common in Spanish cooking,
though.

34
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,500
What are some typical Spanish dishes?

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,140
I’d be interested to try some.

36
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,579
I guess paella is quite well-known.

37
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,729
My personal favourite is a dish called albondigas,
which is meatballs in a tomato sauce.

38
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:00,869
It’s simple, but so tasty.

39
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,200
Sounds good!

40
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Here’s a question: do you know the difference
between the words ‘cuisine’, ‘dish’

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,420
and ‘meal’?

42
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:14,530
‘Cuisine’ means the kind of food you find
in a specific country or culture.

43
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:21,670
For example, you have Chinese cuisine, French
cuisine, local cuisine, and so on.

44
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,360
‘Cuisine’ means something like ‘cooking
style’.

45
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,110
You can use the word ‘food’ or ‘cooking’
in the same way.

46
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,590
So, you can say ‘Chinese cuisine’, ‘Chinese
cooking’ or ‘Chinese food’.

47
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,380
The meaning is very close.

48
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,360
A ‘dish’ means something which is cooked
or prepared.

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,900
Usually, a dish is made from different kinds
of food.

50
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,090
A ‘meal’ is food eaten at a specific time.

51
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,650
Most people eat three meals a day: breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

52
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,330
We often hear English learners make mistakes
with these three words, so be careful with

53
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,590
them!

54
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,260
In the dialogue, you heard how to talk about
different cuisines and dishes which you like.

55
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,770
Look at some questions you heard.

56
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,960
Think about how you could answer these.

57
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,750
When you answer these questions, try to be
detailed.

58
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,840
For example, don’t just say ‘Vietnamese
food is delicious.’

59
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,940
Give some more details!

60
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,130
Say what kind of dishes are the best, or try
to explain why you like it.

61
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,870
For example, you could say ‘Vietnamese food
is delicious, because it uses fresh ingredients

62
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,500
and it’s a little bit spicy, which I like.’

63
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,700
OK?

64
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:43,180
Pause the video and try to answer the questions
now.

65
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,360
Could you do it?

66
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,650
If not, go back and listen to the dialogue
again.

67
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:55,840
Next, let’s look at how to talk about food
you like – or don’t!

68
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,680
So, what do you think?

69
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,660
Oh no!

70
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,720
This is terrible!

71
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
Really?

72
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,420
First, you haven’t cooked the meat long
enough.

73
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,900
It’s tough and really chewy.

74
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,850
You need to keep cooking it until it’s tender.

75
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,010
I cooked it for two hours, just like you said!

76
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,500
Yes, but you also have to check that it’s
done!

77
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,770
Also, these vegetables are awful.

78
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,750
They’re mushy because you’ve overcooked
them.

79
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,620
They should be fresh and crunchy.

80
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,500
Right…

81
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
What about the sauce?

82
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,290
It’s not bad, but it’s a little bland.

83
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,730
A dish like this should be rich, spicy and
a little sour.

84
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,420
While you’re cooking, don’t forget to
taste it, and add more spices, or more vinegar,

85
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,510
or whatever it needs.

86
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,510
Hmm…

87
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,510
OK…

88
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,040
I’m a little scared to show you my dessert,
now.

89
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,660
Ahh, wow!

90
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,920
This is amazing!

91
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,900
Oh?

92
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,280
You mean it?

93
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,290
Yes!

94
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,290
It’s a perfect tart.

95
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,460
It’s crumbly, but not dry, which is a difficult
balance to get right.

96
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,030
The fruit gives it a nice, tangy flavour.

97
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,030
Very tasty!

98
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,370
Thank you!

99
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,650
To describe something you ate, you could start
with the flavour.

100
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:07,630
For example, you can use words like ‘spicy’,
‘sour’, ‘sweet’, ‘bitter’, or

101
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,750
‘rich’.

102
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,840
‘Rich’ can be used to describe heavier
foods.

103
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,490
You also heard ‘bland’ in the dialogue.

104
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,590
‘Bland’ describes something which has
little or no flavour.

105
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,120
Then, you could also describe the texture.

106
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,580
In the dialogue, you heard the word ‘mushy’.

107
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,520
Do you know what this means?

108
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,180
‘Mushy’ means that something is soft,
but in an unpleasant way.

109
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,940
If you cook vegetables too long, they’ll
get mushy.

110
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,660
In the dialogue, you also heard ‘tough’,
‘chewy’, ‘tender’, ‘crunchy’ and

111
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,740
‘crumbly’.

112
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,480
Can you think of foods which these words could
describe?

113
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,920
‘Tough’ and ‘chewy’ are similar.

114
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,200
Both describe foods which are difficult to
eat because you have to chew them for a long

115
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
time.

116
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,820
Meat can be tough or chewy, especially if
it’s cooked too long and it gets dry.

117
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,730
‘Tender’ means something like ‘soft’,
but it’s mostly used to describe meat which

118
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,530
is cooked well, so it’s soft and juicy.

119
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,800
Crunchy foods make a lot of noise when you’re
eating them.

120
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,540
Dry food – like potato chips, or hard cookies
– can be crunchy.

121
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,100
Crumbly food is soft and easily breaks into
pieces.

122
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:30,050
‘Crumbly’ can be good or bad – for a
cake, it might be a good thing, but crumbly

123
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,680
bread might be a bad thing, because it will
fall apart when you try to do anything with

124
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
it.

125
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,400
If you like the taste of something, you can
use general adjectives like ‘great’, ‘amazing’

126
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,780
or ‘fantastic’.

127
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,700
You can also use ‘tasty’ or ‘delicious’.

128
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,400
Be careful: ‘delicious’ is a strong adjective.

129
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,050
That means you can’t say ‘very delicious’;
if you want to add emphasis, say ‘really

130
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,090
delicious’ or ‘absolutely delicious’.

131
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,510
To talk about food you don’t like, use general
adjectives like ‘awful’, ‘terrible’

132
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,430
or ‘disgusting’.

133
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:12,639
Now, a challenge for you: think about the
last thing you ate.

134
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,400
Could you describe it?

135
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,440
Talk about the flavour, the texture, and whether
you liked it or not.

136
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,889
For a bonus, try to explain why you did or
didn’t like it!

137
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:28,400
For example: ‘The last thing I ate was a
lentil soup.

138
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,060
It was quite spicy, but a little bit mushy,
because I overcooked the lentils.

139
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,180
I didn’t like it so much, because it was
a little bland.

140
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,020
Lentils don’t have much flavour.’

141
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,520
Now it’s your turn.

142
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,140
Pause the video and make your answer.

143
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:54,240
Next, let’s see how you can talk about cooking
habits.

144
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,310
Do you cook much?

145
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,310
Sometimes.

146
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,240
I cook maybe twice a week, but I’m too busy
to do more than that.

147
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,570
What do you do the rest of the time?

148
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,680
For lunch, I eat in the canteen at work.

149
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,560
In the evening, I generally get something
from the supermarket, or get a takeaway.

150
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,790
I don’t like it, because I know it’s more
expensive and less healthy than cooking for

151
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,140
myself, but I just don’t have the time.

152
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,380
What about you?

153
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,199
I make most of my meals.

154
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,230
I don’t cook every day, though.

155
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:26,050
I normally do a lot of cooking on Sunday,
and then I have food for the week.

156
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,550
I take a packed lunch to work, and then eat
leftovers in the evening.

157
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,070
That’s a good system!

158
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,760
I wish I could be so organised…

159
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,699
It helps that I have a market very close to
my house.

160
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:41,209
They have great fresh produce, fish, meat…
everything you need.

161
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:43,930
That means I don’t need to spend much time
shopping.

162
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,430
Plus, I prefer eating home-cooked, fresh food.

163
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:53,080
If I don’t have food with me, I end up eating
greasy fast food, and then I feel bloated

164
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
and gross.

165
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,380
Yeah, I’m the same way…

166
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,730
Maybe I’ll start cooking more.

167
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,399
Think about the first question you heard in
the dialogue: ‘Do you cook much?’

168
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,800
How would you answer this?

169
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,320
You could say something like: ‘I cook every
day.’

170
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,140
‘I don’t cook much – maybe once or twice
a week.’

171
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,160
‘I don’t cook.

172
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,430
I’ve never learned how!’

173
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,449
If you don’t cook, what can you do for food?

174
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:26,459
You heard some phrases in the dialogue.

175
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,389
Do you remember?

176
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:33,680
Look at some sentences that you heard.

177
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,860
Imagine you’re an English teacher, and you
want to explain the meanings of the words

178
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,720
in red.

179
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,959
How would you do it?

180
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:49,589
A canteen is a bit like a restaurant, but
it’s run by a company for its staff, or

181
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,449
by a university for its students.

182
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:58,199
Canteens are usually cheap, or the food might
even be free.

183
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:03,300
A takeaway means you buy or order the food
from a restaurant, and then eat it somewhere

184
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,199
else, usually at home.

185
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:14,809
A packed lunch means you take food from home
and eat it at work or school.

186
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:19,139
If you cook more than you can eat, the extra
food is called ‘leftovers’.

187
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,040
You can eat the leftovers on another day.

188
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,540
What about you?

189
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,019
Do you cook much?

190
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:28,620
If not, what do you do for food?

191
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,249
Pause the video now, and try to make a few
sentences to describe your cooking and eating

192
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:35,520
habits.

193
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,200
Done?

194
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,340
Great!

195
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:42,100
Let’s look at our last point.

196
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,069
So, what do we do first?

197
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:47,079
First, we need to fry the aubergine and the
potato.

198
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,889
While you do that, I’ll prepare the meat.

199
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:51,279
How are you going to do it?

200
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,350
It’s easy: you sauté onion and garlic,
then add the meat to brown it.

201
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:02,029
Then you add the tomatoes and simmer it for
fifteen minutes or so until the sauce thickens.

202
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,709
OK, what now?

203
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:06,300
Now we need to make the white sauce.

204
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,680
You know how to make white sauce?

205
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,399
I think so, though I’ve never tried it.

206
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,639
It’s butter, flour and milk, right?

207
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,089
Yes, but you need to be careful.

208
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:18,860
Add the milk very slowly, and stir the sauce
continuously.

209
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,480
Otherwise, it can get lumpy.

210
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,339
Should I use a low heat?

211
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,440
Yes, as low as possible.

212
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,140
So, is that it?

213
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:28,149
Pretty much!

214
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,630
We just need to layer all the parts, sprinkle
some grated cheese on top, and then bake it

215
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,899
for half an hour.

216
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,389
What should I do, then?

217
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:36,389
Get a baking dish.

218
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:40,839
Put the potatoes in the bottom, then the aubergine,
then the meat.

219
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,899
Add another layer of aubergine on top, then
pour in the white sauce.

220
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:46,899
Is it ready?

221
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:47,899
Yeah, I think so.

222
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:49,929
It should be lightly brown on top.

223
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:52,960
Nice work – you made your first moussaka!

224
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,920
By the way, do you know what ‘moussaka’
is?

225
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,720
It’s a famous Greek dish.

226
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,949
It’s easy to find recipes online if you
want to try making it.

227
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:06,679
In the dialogue, you heard several different
verbs related to food preparation.

228
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:09,720
Do you remember any?

229
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,880
Look at some pairs of words.

230
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,589
Could you explain the difference in meaning
between these words pairs?

231
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,000
Pause the video to think about it if you need
time.

232
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,050
‘Sauté’ and ‘fry’ both mean to cook
something in hot fat – usually hot oil.

233
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:33,110
‘Sauté’ means that you cook something
at high temperature for a short time.

234
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:38,170
In everyday language, people mostly say ‘fry’,
but if you’re reading a recipe or watching

235
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:43,480
cooking shows on TV, you might see ‘sauté’.

236
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,379
‘Boil’ and ‘simmer’ both mean to heat
a liquid until it bubbles; ‘simmer’ suggests

237
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,240
you keep the heat as low as possible.

238
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,260
‘Boil’ means you use a higher heat.

239
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,529
‘Pour’ is only for liquids.

240
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:03,120
‘Sprinkle’ means to spread a small amount
of something over something else.

241
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,939
‘Sprinkle’ is mostly used for powders
or things made of small particles, like salt,

242
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,920
herbs, grated cheese, and so on.

243
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,739
Now, it’s your turn.

244
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:16,790
Think about a dish you know how to make.

245
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:21,329
Your job is to give detailed instructions
for how to make it.

246
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:27,519
Imagine you’re teaching someone, and you
want to describe every step of the process.

247
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,999
Before you do this, you can watch the dialogue
again.

248
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:34,839
There are many more words and phrases you
can use to help you.

249
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:37,860
Pause the video, and say your answer out loud.

250
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,839
Or, you can write your answer down and share
your recipe with other students in the comments!

251
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:43,980
That’s all.

252
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,230
Thanks for watching!

253
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:45,920
See you next time!
