00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:02,889
Hi, I’m Liam.

2
00:00:02,889 --> 00:00:04,550
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,170
In this lesson, you can learn about using
the present simple and present continuous

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,219
verb forms.

5
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:15,509
You’ll see many different ways to use these
verb tenses, from basic meanings to more advanced

6
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:16,730
uses.

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,029
A question for you: do you want to watch this
video with subtitles?

8
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:22,789
You can – it’s easy!

9
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:27,000
Turn them on now by clicking the ‘CC’
icon in the bottom right.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,050
Or, on your phone, use the settings icon at
the top of the video player.

11
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,530
Here’s how this lesson works.

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,590
There are five levels.

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,430
Each level is more difficult than the previous
one.

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,039
Level one is beginner.

15
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:45,850
Levels two to four are intermediate.

16
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,950
Level five is high intermediate to advanced.

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,090
If you’re not a beginner, start at level
two!

18
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,969
At each level, you can see what you need to
focus on if you have difficulties.

19
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:00,170
Ready?

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,420
Let’s start!

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,320
You’ll see five sentences which use the
present simple or present continuous.

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,830
You need to complete each sentence with one
word.

23
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,570
The verb you need to use is given at the end
of the sentence.

24
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,230
Here are your sentences.

25
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:26,080
Pause the video and think about your answers.

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,280
Ready?

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,830
Let’s look.

28
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,990
What do you need to know here?

29
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,850
You need to know how to form the present simple
and present continuous.

30
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:46,240
For example, you need to know rules like:
add ‘s’ to the verb in the present simple

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,660
after ‘he’, ‘she’ or ‘it’.

32
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,000
You need to know that you make the present
continuous with the verb ‘be’ plus an

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,140
-ing verb.

34
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:02,300
You should also know how to make negatives
and questions with these two tenses.

35
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,540
Easy?

36
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,860
Maybe, but even advanced English learners
sometimes make mistakes with these points.

37
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:15,409
Practise them carefully so you don’t form
bad habits!

38
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:21,239
In this section, you need to choose the correct
form in each sentence.

39
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,900
Look at your questions.

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,700
Pause the video and find your answers.

41
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,480
Did you do it?

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,860
Let’s check.

43
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,940
Here, you need to think about the meaning
of these two verb forms.

44
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:46,880
Use the present simple for habits or things
you do regularly, like in sentence one.

45
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,320
Use the present continuous for things which
are happening right now, like in sentence

46
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:54,459
two.

47
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:02,320
You also use the present continuous for things
which are unfinished, like in sentence three.

48
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:09,740
For facts and things which are generally true,
use the present simple, like in sentence four.

49
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:15,069
If you’re describing a photo or a picture,
and want to say what’s happening, use the

50
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:20,190
present continuous, like in sentence five.

51
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,849
If you understand these ideas, you’ll be
able to use the present simple and the present

52
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:28,680
continuous in many everyday sentences.

53
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:37,300
However, there are many more things you need
to know to use these verb forms well.

54
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,879
Here, we have a different challenge for you.

55
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,300
Some of these sentences are correct; some
are incorrect.

56
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,670
Your job is to find the correct sentences,
and correct the mistakes in the others.

57
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,099
Pause the video and do it now.

58
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,769
What do you think?

59
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,999
How many correct sentences do you think there
are?

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,400
Could you correct the mistakes in the others?

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,080
Let’s look together.

62
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,120
Sentences two and five are correct; the others
all have mistakes.

63
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,840
Now, you can see the mistakes, and the corrections.

64
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,570
Can you explain the problems with sentences
one, three and four?

65
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,080
Why are they wrong?

66
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,920
Verbs of sensing, like ‘smell’, ‘see’
or ‘hear’ are not generally used in the

67
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,620
present continuous.

68
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,190
In sentence one, even though you’re talking
about something which is just true now, you

69
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:45,360
use the present simple because you’re using
a verb of sensing – ‘smell’.

70
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,980
Sentence two is correct.

71
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,420
Use the present continuous to talk about arrangements
in the future.

72
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,740
This is common for talking about social plans.

73
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,940
You can also use the present simple to talk
about the future, like in sentence three.

74
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,180
Do you know why you use the present simple
here?

75
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,130
Use the present simple to talk about future
events which follow a timetable.

76
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:17,980
This includes things like trains, planes,
meetings, appointments and lessons.

77
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:25,180
Verbs of thinking or speaking, like ‘promise’,
aren’t generally used in the present continuous.

78
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,160
Can you think of other verbs like this?

79
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:36,980
There are many, but ‘know’, ‘realise’,
‘remember’, ‘admit’ and ‘state’

80
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,900
are almost always used in the present simple,
even if you’re talking about something which

81
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,450
is happening now.

82
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:51,840
In general, you can divide verbs into two
types: *action* verbs and *state* verbs.

83
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:59,860
Action verbs, like ‘run’, ‘do’ or
‘cook’, can be either simple or continuous.

84
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:05,710
State verbs, like ‘be’, ‘know’ or
‘love’, cannot normally be used in the

85
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,940
present continuous.

86
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:14,700
There are exceptions to this, but it’s a
useful general rule to remember.

87
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:22,120
Finally, in sentence five, can you explain
why you need to use the present continuous?

88
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,080
Use the present continuous to describe changing
situations, or to talk about trends.

89
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:33,680
This is useful if you need to talk about statistics;
for example ‘sales are falling by an average

90
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,240
of 2% annually.’

91
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,460
There’s a lot of information in this video.

92
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,490
Remember that you can always review a section
if you need to!

93
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,880
Or, take a break and come back later.

94
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,300
Now, let’s move on to level four.

95
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,770
Level four is a little different again.

96
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,600
Look at your sentences.

97
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,660
This time, you have two jobs.

98
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,160
First, are both forms possible?

99
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,130
In some sentences, you can use either the
present simple or the continuous.

100
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,500
In at least one sentence, you can’t use
both.

101
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,120
Where can you – or can’t you – use both
forms?

102
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,880
Secondly, where you *can* use both forms,
is there a difference in meaning?

103
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,380
If so, can you explain it?

104
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,830
Pause the video and think about these questions
now.

105
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,120
Take your time!

106
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,320
Ready?

107
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,300
Let’s check.

108
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,590
In sentence one, both forms are possible.

109
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,020
Using the present simple suggests that this
is a permanent situation.

110
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:47,580
She works there because this is her long-term
job, and she’ll probably continue to work

111
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,400
there.

112
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,030
Using the present continuous suggests that
this is something temporary.

113
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:59,970
She’s working there for a short time, and
she’ll probably be working somewhere else

114
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,180
soon.

115
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,300
In sentence two, both forms are also possible.

116
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,580
Using the present continuous expresses that
you find this habit annoying or strange.

117
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,860
You can do this with adverbs like ‘always’
or ‘constantly’.

118
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,590
The adverb is necessary!

119
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:22,900
You can *only* use the present continuous
to talk about a habit if you use an adverb,

120
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,360
like ‘always’.

121
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,320
Using the present simple here is neutral.

122
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,530
It doesn’t add any extra meaning.

123
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:33,680
It just expresses that he has this habit.

124
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,719
In sentence three, using the continuous expresses
that you’re just starting to understand

125
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,740
this idea.

126
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:47,600
In level three, you saw that verbs of thinking,
like ‘realise’, aren’t generally used

127
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,760
in the present continuous.

128
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,519
That’s true, but there’s an important
exception.

129
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:01,410
Use the present continuous to express feelings
which you are just starting to be aware of.

130
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:07,949
When a feeling is coming to you, and you’re
still processing your thoughts, you can use

131
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:11,589
the present continuous to talk about it.

132
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:17,959
Here, it means that you’ve just started
to understand that he’s been lying to you,

133
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,199
or you’ve recently found out that he’s
dishonest.

134
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:27,529
You’re still processing those thoughts.

135
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:33,399
Using the present simple suggests that this
is not a new feeling.

136
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:41,460
It suggests that you understood that you were
wrong to trust him some time ago.

137
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,660
Sentence four is similar to sentence one.

138
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,220
Both forms are possible; using the present
simple suggests that this is a more permanent

139
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,200
situation, while using the present continuous
suggests something more temporary.

140
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,779
For example, if they’ve only just started
playing tennis, and they’re both really

141
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:03,899
lazy and you’re sure they’ll give up soon,
then you’d probably use the continuous here.

142
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:08,930
But, if they’ve been playing tennis on Fridays
for years, and you know they’re both really

143
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:14,170
enthusiastic about it and are likely to continue
for a long time, then you’d use the present

144
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,820
simple.

145
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,420
Sentence five is different.

146
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,160
Why?

147
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,730
Because there isn’t a difference in meaning.

148
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:29,889
There’s another point: while it’s possible
to say ‘My English gets better year after

149
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:33,760
year,’ using the continuous sounds better.

150
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,860
You’re talking about a changing situation
– like you saw in level three – and it’s

151
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:45,259
more common to use the continuous in this
case.

152
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:51,589
Up to now, you’ve seen many different ways
to use the present simple and continuous.

153
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:56,880
Are you ready for the hardest challenge?

154
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,511
Here are your sentences.

155
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:06,780
Your task is simple: put the verbs into either
the present simple or the present continuous.

156
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,100
You know what to do!

157
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,220
Pause the video and find your answers.

158
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,640
Ready?

159
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,639
Let’s see how you did.

160
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,100
Did you get them all right?

161
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,829
If so, great job!

162
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:25,250
If not, don’t worry.

163
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:30,660
These sentences test some more difficult and
specialised uses of the present simple and

164
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,819
continuous.

165
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:36,720
In sentence one, do you know why you use the
present simple?

166
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,060
A question: what is this sentence?

167
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,120
Who’s saying it?

168
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,320
This sentence sounds like live commentary
on a football match.

169
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:49,540
When commenting on live events, it’s common
to use the present simple, even for things

170
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:55,110
which are happening right now, when you would
usually expect to hear the continuous.

171
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:00,490
In sentence two, did you think it might be
correct to use the continuous?

172
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:06,740
The first part of the sentence – ‘he never
listens’ – sounds like an annoying habit.

173
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:12,899
You saw in level four that you can use the
continuous to talk about strange or annoying

174
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:13,899
habits.

175
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,920
But, you can’t use it here.

176
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,100
Why not?

177
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,649
It’s because you can only use the present
continuous in this way with specific adverbs

178
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:32,240
– ‘always’ is the most common – and
you can’t do this with ‘never’.

179
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,680
In sentence three, you can use present tenses
to tell a story, especially in informal conversation.

180
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,360
In most cases, you’d use past tenses to
tell a story, but you can also move the past

181
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,070
tenses into the present: past continuous becomes
present continuous, past simple becomes present

182
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,600
simple, and so on.

183
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,860
This can make your story sound more vivid,
as if it’s taking place now.

184
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,990
For sentence four, where do you think this
sentence comes from?

185
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:11,620
Notice the capital letters, and the fact that
it doesn’t have a full stop at the end.

186
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,040
It’s a newspaper headline.

187
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:20,430
Headlines are written in a specific style,
and often use the present simple to talk about

188
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:25,000
events in the recent past.

189
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,059
What about sentence five?

190
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,740
Can you explain what’s going on here?

191
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,740
The key here is that ‘see’ has different
meanings.

192
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,960
The first ‘see’ means ‘understand’.

193
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,500
This is a state verb, so it can’t be continuous.

194
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,620
The second ‘see’ means ‘meet’ or ‘have
a relationship with’.

195
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,449
It’s an action verb, so it can be continuous.

196
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:52,069
There are other verbs like this, where there
are multiple meanings, some of which are actions,

197
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:54,279
and some of which are states.

198
00:13:54,279 --> 00:14:00,279
Other common verbs like this are ‘have’,
‘think’, ‘expect’ or ‘look’.

199
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,360
How did you do on this lesson?

200
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,259
Which points did you find most difficult or
confusing?

201
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:12,079
Let us know how you did in the comments, and
what was most difficult for you!

202
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,079
Thanks for watching!
