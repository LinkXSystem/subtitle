00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,600
Hi, I’m Olivier.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,189
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,189 --> 00:00:10,580
In this lesson, you can learn how to improve
your English grammar.

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,320
To some people, ‘grammar’ is kind of a
dirty word.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,940
It probably makes you think of boring textbooks,
boring exercises, and boring lessons.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,330
Maybe you think, “Why do I need grammar?

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,300
I just want to communicate.”

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:31,130
But, here’s the thing: grammar isn’t just
something in a book.

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:37,219
Grammar is how you connect words into phrases,
and phrases into sentences.

10
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:41,510
Every time you connect two words, you’re
using grammar.

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:47,550
Even now, you’re using grammar to understand
what we’re saying.

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:54,749
We think there’s a better way to learn English
grammar than just doing endless exercises.

13
00:00:54,749 --> 00:01:00,569
In this lesson, you’ll see a step-by-step,
practical plan to improve your English grammar

14
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:03,370
in any area.

15
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,500
To work on grammar, it’s a good idea to
have a book for reference.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,910
One of the most popular is English Grammar
in Use by Raymond Murphy.

17
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,979
You can find a link under the video.

18
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:19,860
So, let’s start: you want to improve your
English grammar.

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,680
What should you do first?

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,860
‘English grammar’ is not just one topic.

21
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:33,540
It’s tens of major topics, and each of those
contains tens of smaller topics.

22
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,799
So, you need to know where to begin.

23
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,090
You need to set goals and establish priorities
for your studies.

24
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,679
How can you do that?

25
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:46,200
Let’s start with five things.

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,000
Make a list of five errors or grammar problems
you have.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,710
Maybe, you already know some errors you make.

28
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:59,560
Maybe your teacher corrects you or your classmates
often, and you have an idea.

29
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,979
A good way to do this is through writing.

30
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:08,220
Write something for your teacher, and ask
them to highlight and correct your grammar

31
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,660
mistakes.

32
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,980
See which mistakes you make most often.

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,280
If you aren’t studying with a teacher, what
can you do?

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,510
This can be more difficult.

35
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,680
One suggestion: use a grammar book which has
exercises and an answer key.

36
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,680
Choose five topics which you think you will
find difficult.

37
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,340
Do the exercises and check your answers.

38
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:39,230
If you made a lot of mistakes, then you know
you need to do more work on these topics.

39
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:46,099
Here’s another suggestion: find a reading
text, for example a news article online.

40
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,940
Make sure the text is not too difficult for
you.

41
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,209
Read the text two to three times.

42
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:55,810
Next, try to rewrite the text without looking
at it.

43
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,030
Don’t worry about getting it perfect; just
do your best.

44
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,340
Afterwards, compare your text with the original.

45
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,150
Where did you make mistakes?

46
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,700
Did you make mistakes with verb forms?

47
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,140
With adverbs?

48
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,620
Word order?

49
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,030
This should show you where some of your grammar
mistakes are.

50
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,519
Okay, hopefully now you have a list of five
grammar errors or weaknesses.

51
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,800
It could look like this:

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,069
Using the present perfect
Word order in questions

53
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:33,670
Using commas correctly
Mixing up adjectives and adverbs

54
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,000
Prepositions after adjectives

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,150
Be as specific as you can with your list.

56
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,720
Writing something like ‘verbs’ or ‘prepositions’
isn’t really helpful.

57
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,200
Now, you have your list.

58
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,120
What’s next?

59
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:58,940
If you have a problem with a grammar topic,
there can be two basic reasons: form or function.

60
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,060
The first possibility is that you don’t
know how to form a structure correctly.

61
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,190
For example, think about the present perfect
verb tense: I have done…

62
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,739
To form the present perfect, you need to know
several things, such as:

63
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:21,140
Use ‘have’ or ‘has’ plus a past participle
Make negatives with ‘haven’t’ or ‘hasn’t’

64
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:27,160
Make questions by moving ‘have’ or ‘has’
before the subject

65
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,960
If you don’t know these rules well, you
might make mistakes like these:

66
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,120
She have been to Cambodia.

67
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,740
I don’t have finished.

68
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,240
How long they have lived here?

69
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,200
Can you correct these mistakes?

70
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,840
Often, problems with form are habits.

71
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,860
You say and write the wrong sentence hundreds
of times, and then it’s hard to change it.

72
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,680
The only way to correct these habits is to
repeat and review the correct form many, many

73
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,640
times.

74
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,320
The best way to do that?

75
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,620
Use a flashcard app like Quizlet.

76
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,440
We’ll talk about this in more detail later.

77
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,940
Or, maybe you don’t know the correct form.

78
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,180
If so, use your grammar book to check.

79
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,660
Problems with form are simpler to understand,
but sometimes they take a long time to fix,

80
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,740
especially if your mistakes have become deep
habits.

81
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,860
You heard before that there are two basic
reasons you could have problems with a grammar

82
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,820
topic.

83
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,500
What’s the other?

84
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,500
The other possibility is that you don’t
understand the function.

85
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,520
What does that mean?

86
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,370
‘Function’ means how a grammar structure
is used, and what meaning it has.

87
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,930
For example, think again about the present
perfect verb tense.

88
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,940
To use the present perfect correctly, you
need to know things like:

89
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:05,160
Use the present perfect to talk about states
which started in the past and are still true

90
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,520
now.

91
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,380
Don’t use the present perfect to talk about
finished times in the past.

92
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:18,419
Use the present perfect to talk about life
experiences when you don’t specify a time.

93
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,590
Of course, there are more!

94
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,470
These are just examples.

95
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,819
If you don’t understand these rules, you
might make mistakes like these:

96
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,860
I am living here since four years.

97
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,700
We’ve had lunch three hours ago.

98
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,420
Have you ever been to Japan last year?

99
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:42,200
Can you correct these mistakes?

100
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,520
Often, problems with function are problems
with translation.

101
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,160
Maybe your language doesn’t have this grammar
structure, or maybe your language expresses

102
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,780
expresses these ideas in a different way.

103
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:01,980
If you have problems with the function of
a grammar structure, what can you do?

104
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:07,730
First, check the rules in your grammar book
and try to find example sentences.

105
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,660
Think about how you would express the same
ideas in your language.

106
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,170
Secondly, think about how this grammar works
in your language.

107
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,930
Do you have the same structure?

108
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,140
Do you use it in the same way?

109
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:27,380
The most difficult grammar topics will often
be things which don’t exist in your language.

110
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,480
For example, many languages don’t have an
exact equivalent to the present perfect in

111
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:40,960
English, which is why so many English learners
find this verb tense particularly difficult.

112
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,660
However, thinking about the differences between
your language and English can help to make

113
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,780
things clearer.

114
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:54,220
Okay, so now you’ve found your mistakes
and thought about where they come from.

115
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,160
What next?

116
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,580
You’re going to see one of the most powerful
learning tools you can use.

117
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,540
Even better, it’s simple!

118
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,960
Anyone can use it.

119
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,819
It’s called templating.

120
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:14,720
Templating means you take part of a sentence,
and finish it in different ways.

121
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,800
Let’s stick with the example of the present
perfect.

122
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,320
Here’s an unfinished sentence:

123
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,870
I have never…

124
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,420
Your job is to finish the sentence in five
different ways.

125
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,940
Make them as different as possible.

126
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,680
Here’s one example:

127
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,860
I have never eaten snake.

128
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,120
Can you make one or two more?

129
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,860
Think about it now.

130
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,720
You could make sentences like:

131
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,800
I have never been to New Zealand.

132
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,320
I have never seen ‘Titanic’.

133
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,560
Try to make sentences which are true for you.

134
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,000
This way, they’ll be more meaningful and
easier to remember.

135
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,360
Remember: you need five sentences for each
template.

136
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,820
That means you need to think of at least two
more!

137
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,960
Think of two more things you’ve never done,
and write them down.

138
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:17,720
Let’s look at some more templates you could
use to practice the present perfect:

139
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,400
I have … this week.

140
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:27,720
I haven’t … yet today.

141
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:38,920
… have/has been living … for …
I’ve been … recently.

142
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,680
My … has … since …

143
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,520
Can you see how you could complete these templates?

144
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,960
Think about it.

145
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,160
Pause the video if you want more time.

146
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,400
Let’s see some possibilities:

147
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,700
I’ve watched this video three times this
week.

148
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,080
I haven’t had coffee yet today.

149
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,480
My sister has been living in Milan for three
years.

150
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,420
I’ve been reading a lot of Chekhov recently.

151
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,600
My wife has been a doctor since 2005.

152
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,060
Of course, these are just suggestions!

153
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,200
You should write sentences which are true
for you.

154
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,500
Also, remember that you should try to write
five sentences for each template.

155
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,180
If you can’t think of five, write as many
as you can.

156
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,200
You can use this to practice any grammar topic.

157
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,580
For example, here are three templates you
could use to practice using must, have to

158
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,880
and should:

159
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,340
At work, we mustn’t …
Tomorrow, I have to …

160
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,440
If you want to learn English quickly, you
should …

161
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,560
Here are three templates you could use to
practice talking about the future:

162
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:55,880
Tonight, I’m …
For my next vacation, we’re going to …

163
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,820
Next year, I hope I’ll …

164
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,000
You see,

165
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,320
you can use this to practice anything.

166
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,180
Why should you use this method?

167
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,040
What makes it so powerful?

168
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,480
It’s powerful because you’re learning
grammar through real-life examples.

169
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,280
Also, you’re learning grammar in full sentences.

170
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,320
Finally, this lets you practice your vocabulary,
too!

171
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,780
You have one more thing to do here.

172
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,900
You need to make sure your templated sentences
are correct.

173
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,140
You’re going to use these templates to practice
and learn.

174
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:42,060
If you have any mistakes in your sentences,
you’ll just create bad habits which will

175
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,640
be difficult to change in the future.

176
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,760
So, ask your teacher, ask a friend, or ask
on an online forum.

177
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,900
Make sure your sentences are correct.

178
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:58,420
Now, you’re ready for step four.

179
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:07,180
Flashcard apps like Quizlet or Anki are a great way to review and remember grammar when
you’re learning English.

180
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:14,040
Both of these apps are mostly free to use,
although the Anki app for IoS costs money.

181
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,260
Our staff and our students have had good results
with both these apps.

182
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,960
There are others available, and you should
probably try different ones and see which

183
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,700
one you like best!

184
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,480
You can find links underneath the video.

185
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,860
So, why do you need an app like this?

186
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,840
Using a flashcard app will help you to remember
more of what you study and practice.

187
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,340
How can you do this?

188
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,580
First, you can make questions using your template
sentences.

189
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:51,460
Put one or two gaps in a sentence and make
a question, like this:

190
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,000
Do you remember the answer?

191
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,220
You can also make a question with a mistake
which you make frequently.

192
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,000
The answer is the corrected sentence.

193
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,220
For example:

194
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,080
Correct the mistake: I just have had a shower.

195
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,920
Can you correct the mistake?

196
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,760
I’ve just had a shower.

197
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
The word order was wrong.

198
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,160
Put the correct sentence as your answer.

199
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:28,860
So, there are two kinds of cards you can make:
gapped sentences and error correction.

200
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:34,540
You can make gapped sentence cards easier
or harder by leaving out different numbers

201
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,520
of words.

202
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,860
For example:

203
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,800
My sister has ________ ________ in Milan for
three years.

204
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:50,940
Or: My sister ________ ________ ________ ________
________ ________ three years.

205
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,200
You might be thinking: this sounds like a
lot of work!

206
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,580
Do I really have to make my own cards?

207
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,180
Do I have to do this for every grammar topic
I study?

208
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,240
No, you don’t have to, but you should.

209
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,840
Here’s why:

210
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,160
First, you should make your own cards so that
you’re using your own examples.

211
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,280
Your own examples should mean something to
you.

212
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,500
They’re real; they’re about you and your
life.

213
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,960
This makes them easier to remember.

214
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:27,500
Secondly, you should spend the time to make
your own cards because it will save you time

215
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,840
later.

216
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:35,360
If you review efficiently, you can remember
seventy to eighty percent of what you learn.

217
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,400
If you don’t, you’ll forget most of what
you study, and then you’ll have to do it

218
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,920
again in the future.

219
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,200
So, spending time now will save you a lot
more time in the future.

220
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,320
Not only that: isn’t it frustrating when
you can’t remember something you’ve studied

221
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,300
tens of times?

222
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,720
It’s demotivating, and that’s a problem.

223
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,840
You need to be motivated to learn English!

224
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:08,780
Using flashcards and templating will help
you to remember more of what you study.

225
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:14,980
This will give you motivation, because you’ll
feel that you’re making more progress.

226
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:21,360
Finally, make sure you review your cards every
day, or as often as possible.

227
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,420
Review your cards when you have a spare moment
during the day.

228
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:31,260
For example, do them before you get up in
the morning, or on the subway to work,

229
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,140
or during a break.

230
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,440
Now, you have a four-step process to improve
your English grammar:

231
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,720
Step one: identify and write down your weaknesses.

232
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,400
Start with five topics maximum.

233
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,440
The topics you write down should be as specific
as possible.

234
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,940
Step two: identify the mistakes you make and
the problems you have.

235
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:59,620
Do you have problems with the form, or the
function, or both?

236
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,080
Use a grammar book to check, or ask a teacher.

237
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,680
Step three: make templates, and write five
full sentences for each template.

238
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,040
The sentences should be real: write true sentences
about you and your life.

239
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,900
Check your sentences carefully and make sure
they’re correct.

240
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:25,280
Step four: take your sentences and make them
into flashcards.

241
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,840
You can make gapped sentences or error correction
questions.

242
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,640
Review your cards regularly.

243
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,680
And that’s all!

244
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,120
Use these tools, and you can learn anything
you want to efficiently.

245
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,160
Tell us: what’s the first grammar topic
you’re going to review?

246
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,620
Let us know in the comments, and we can see
if you have similar ideas or not!
