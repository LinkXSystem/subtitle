00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,940
Hi, I’m Justin.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,700
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,680
In this lesson, you can learn how to answer
task one of the IELTS general writing exam.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,390
In the general IELTS writing exam, task one
involves writing a letter.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,340
Usually, you have to do three things in your
letter.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,390
You have 20 minutes and you need to write
at least 150 words.

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,809
In this lesson, you’ll see how to plan and
write an effective general task 1 IELTS answer.

8
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:41,249
You’ll learn simple strategies you can use
to write a better answer and improve your

9
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,780
IELTS writing score.

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,100
Let’s start by looking at a sample question:

11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,690
Your neighbour has been making a lot of noise
recently.

12
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,850
This has been causing you problems, and you
want to ask them to stop.

13
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,159
Write a letter to your neighbour.

14
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,199
In your letter:

15
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,620
- ask for an explanation for the noise
- explain the problems this has caused for

16
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,729
you
- say what will happen if the problem is not

17
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:06,969
solved

18
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:13,180
Pause the video if you want more time to look
at the question.

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:20,950
Let’s begin by looking at what you need
to think about before you write.

20
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:27,560
Planning for IELTS general task one answers
is easier than for other IELTS writing tasks.

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,170
All general task one questions have the same
structure.

22
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,710
This means that your answer can have the same
structure every time.

23
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,240
The question asks you to do three things.

24
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,869
Each point can go in its own paragraph.

25
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:52,000
So, your answer will have three short paragraphs,
like this:

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,280
Then, you need a short introduction.

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,189
For this question, you can just write a single
sentence to explain why you’re writing,

28
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:03,040
like this:

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,390
I am writing to complain about the noise levels
coming from your apartment in recent weeks.

30
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,520
The introduction might be different in other
tasks.

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,140
For example, if you’re writing to a friend,
you’d write something much simpler.

32
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,720
There is one more thing you need to think
about when planning: tone.

33
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:30,600
When we say ‘tone’, we mean how formal
or informal your letter should be.

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,080
Task one of the general IELTS writing exam
is the only place where tone is clearly mentioned

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,930
in the scoring scheme.

36
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,670
You need to write in an appropriate tone,
and your tone needs to be consistent.

37
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,510
What tone do you think you need here?

38
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:53,840
Should your letter be formal, neutral, or
informal?

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,460
Probably, your letter will be somewhere between
neutral and formal.

40
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,330
You’re writing to your neighbour, so you
don’t need to be incredibly formal, but

41
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,930
you’re also writing to complain, which adds
formality.

42
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,980
In our experience, one of the most common
mistakes with task one answers is not getting

43
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,870
the tone right.

44
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,260
Either candidates choose an inappropriate
level of formality, or they mix different

45
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,950
levels in the same answer.

46
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,540
Both of these mistakes will hurt your score.

47
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,140
So, before you write anything, think about
how formal your letter should be.

48
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:40,300
Now, you have a plan; let’s write our first
paragraph!

49
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,470
Look at the beginning of a letter:

50
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,470
Dear Emily,

51
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,940
How’s it going?

52
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:52,110
I’m actually writing because I have some
issues with noise coming from your apartment.

53
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,510
I would like to demand an explanation for
the noise levels.

54
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,470
I mean, what on earth are you doing that’s
so noisy?

55
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:08,370
I can hardly have a conversation with someone
sitting next to me, because it’s so loud.

56
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,820
Please inform me what is occurring.

57
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,060
Pause the video if you want more time to look
at the answer.

58
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,480
Think about whether this is good, or whether
it needs some work.

59
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,920
There’s a problem with this beginning.

60
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,720
Do you know what it is?

61
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,590
The problem is tone.

62
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,650
As you heard before, it’s a common mistake
to mix formal and informal language.

63
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,460
Here, you can see very formal sentences, like:

64
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,620
I would like to demand an explanation for
the noise levels.

65
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,520
You can also see more informal language, like:

66
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,290
I mean, what on earth are you doing that’s
so noisy?

67
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:55,590
The start of the letter also mixes different
levels of formality.

68
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,990
Writing how’s it going? is a more informal
way to start a letter or an email, but if

69
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:08,130
you’re writing to complain, you would almost
certainly need to use a more neutral or formal

70
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,340
tone.

71
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:16,350
To get a high score in the general IELTS writing
exam, you need to write in a consistent tone.

72
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:22,500
If you want to practice, think about how you
could improve the answer you saw before.

73
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,590
You can pause the video, and start again when
you’re ready.

74
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:33,870
Let’s see how you could improve this answer:
Pause the video if you need more time to read.

75
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,700
You can see that we’ve got rid of some of
the more informal language, like how’s it

76
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,380
going?

77
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,960
This is also better because it’s consistent
without being too formal.

78
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,340
Our original answer included very formal language,
like Please inform me what is occurring.

79
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,560
You don’t get more points for being more
formal; you get a high score by writing in

80
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,430
an appropriate and consistent tone.

81
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:08,210
Next, let’s continue by thinking about use
of language in your answer.

82
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:15,050
Task one of the general IELTS writing exam
is the simplest of all the IELTS writing tasks.

83
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,680
This is an advantage, but it also means you
need to think carefully about using a wide

84
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,690
range of language.

85
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:26,490
Let’s look at this by adding another paragraph
to our model answer:

86
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,400
This situation is having a bad effect on my
entire family.

87
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,950
I have been unable to sleep, because of the
loud noises even late at night.

88
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,710
My son complains that he cannot do his homework.

89
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:47,870
Even our dog has been behaving oddly; she
is not eating well and has no energy.

90
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,389
This is a good paragraph, and the use of language
is already good.

91
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:58,490
However, to get higher scores, you would need
to use a wider range of language.

92
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,350
Let’s do two things here.

93
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,930
First, look at the five underlined words and
phrases.

94
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:11,080
Can you change these words and phrases to
make them more detailed and more specific?

95
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,560
Think about it—you’ll see some possible
answers in a minute.

96
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,790
Your second job is to take two sentences and
combine them into a more complex sentence.

97
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:28,790
There’s more than one way you could do this,
so find an idea which makes sense to you.

98
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,680
Think about your answers now.

99
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Pause the video if you need more time.

100
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,720
Ready?

101
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:41,389
Let’s look:
You can see that you don’t need to make

102
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:43,180
big changes.

103
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,670
A lot of students think that you need to use
a lot of very academic language to get high

104
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,770
scores in IELTS.

105
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,020
You don’t.

106
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:58,729
To get high scores—even band 9—you need
to use a range of language with flexibility

107
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,820
and precision.

108
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:06,790
That might include academic language in some
cases, but for a letter, that wouldn’t be

109
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,020
appropriate.

110
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,560
Collocations are very important for your IELTS
vocabulary score.

111
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:19,330
Using collocations like sleep properly, noise
levels, lose your appetite, or focus on your

112
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,870
homework will boost your vocabulary score.

113
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,419
For grammar, we simply connected two sentences
with the conjunction while.

114
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:33,219
This adds variety to the sentence structures,
which will also help your score.

115
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,490
At this point, you need to write one more
paragraph.

116
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:43,600
Here, you’re going to see how you can connect
your ideas more effectively.

117
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,680
There’s a common problem we see with IELTS
writing in our students.

118
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:51,790
Students often plan each paragraph separately.

119
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,889
Then, they write each paragraph as a separate
unit, and the paragraphs don’t have much

120
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:00,550
connection to each other.

121
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:07,079
This will hurt your score; 25 per cent of
your score is for coherence and cohesion.

122
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:14,600
To get a higher score for coherence and cohesion,
your writing needs to have a clear progression.

123
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,779
That means it needs to have a clear beginning,
middle, and end.

124
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:24,329
Let’s look at a final paragraph which doesn’t
handle this well:

125
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:28,990
I must ask you to reduce the amount of noise
you make, and try to keep quiet during the

126
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,070
evening when we are at home.

127
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,509
If you continue making noise at these levels,
I will have no choice but to make a noise

128
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:39,630
complaint to the police and/or to the city
council.

129
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,899
Regards,

130
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:42,180
Samira

131
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,769
Pause the video if you want more time to read
the paragraph.

132
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:50,670
This is not bad, but it doesn’t include
any links or references to the other points

133
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,649
you’ve made in the letter.

134
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:58,769
It also lacks a concluding phrase, which could
provide a strong, clear end to your letter.

135
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:05,279
Let’s see how you could improve this:
Can you see what’s changed?

136
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,759
Pause the video to read.

137
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,470
There are four changes.

138
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:21,519
First, we made a reference to the first paragraph,
then we added a reference to the second paragraph.

139
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:28,259
We also avoided repetition by adding a reference
to ‘this situation’, instead of talking

140
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:31,450
about noise levels again.

141
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,850
Finally, we added a concluding phrase.

142
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,300
And you’ve finished!

143
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,319
Practice these steps and ideas and you should
be able to get a high score in task one of

144
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:44,709
the general IELTS exam.

145
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:51,220
Here’s a question for you: what do you find
most difficult in task one of the general

146
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,760
IELTS writing exam?

147
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,670
Please let us know in the comments.

148
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:02,170

com.

150
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,269
Look for a link in the video description if
you’re watching on YouTube.

151
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,759
Thanks for watching!

152
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,290
See you next time!
