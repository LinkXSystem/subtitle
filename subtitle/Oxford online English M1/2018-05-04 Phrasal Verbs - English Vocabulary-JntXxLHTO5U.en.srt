00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,500
Hi, I’m Daniel.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,480
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,260
In this lesson, you can find out about English
phrasal verbs.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,359
Are you looking for a lesson which helps you
to understand and use English phrasal verbs?

5
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,260
We’ll go through several useful tips in
this lesson.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,730
Before we go on, let’s think about why phrasal
verbs are so important in English.

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,640
In spoken English, people use phrasal verbs
all the time.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,289
In fact, you’ve already come across five
phrasal verbs in this video!

9
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:37,949
Did you notice them?

10
00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:41,690
Go back to the start and try to find them
if you want.

11
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:48,220
Let’s start with some basic information
about English phrasal verbs

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,960
Hi, Maria!

13
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:52,969
Glad you could come along!

14
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,280
Sorry for turning up so late.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,839
I got on the wrong bus and then I was wandering
around for ages looking for your street.

16
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:03,289
Don’t worry about it.

17
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:04,910
Should I take my shoes off?

18
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,119
If you don’t mind.

19
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,500
Would you like something to drink before we
head off?

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Tea?

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Coffee?

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,720
I’m dying for a cup of coffee!

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,960
Oh no!

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,220
We’ve run out of coffee!

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,689
I’ll pop out to the shop and pick up some
more.

26
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:20,840
Don’t be silly!

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,460
We can stop by at the café on the way and
I’ll get a cup to go.

28
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,460
Good idea!

29
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,450
Let’s go now, then.

30
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,300
Give me a minute to put my shoes back on…

31
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,159
There were many phrasal verbs in the dialogue.

32
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,969
In fact, there are thirteen.

33
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:39,030
How many did you hear?

34
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,539
Could you write them down?

35
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:44,469
Do you know what they mean?

36
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:48,590
If you want to practice more, go back and
listen again.

37
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,530
Try to write down all thirteen phrasal verbs.

38
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,189
The phrasal verbs you heard were:

39
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:58,909
come along
turn up

40
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,049
get on
wander around

41
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:06,539
look for
take off

42
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:10,479
head off
be dying for

43
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,080
run out of
pop out

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,790
pick up
stop by

45
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,470
put on

46
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,290
Did you get them all?

47
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,060
Next: what makes these verbs phrasal verbs?

48
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:36,820
Can explain what phrasal verbs are?
Phrasal verbs have two or more parts: a verb,

49
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:47,040
like come, turn, get or pop, and one or more
particles, like along, up, on, or around.

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,400
Some phrasal verbs exist as set phrases, like
be dying for.

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,920
You could argue that it isn’t really a phrasal
verb, but it behaves like one, so we’ve

52
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,980
included it here.

53
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,189
Most importantly, a phrasal verb has one meaning.

54
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:09,599
The verb and particle don’t have independent
meanings.

55
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:17,569
For example, in the verb turn up, the words
turn and up don’t have separate meanings.

56
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:22,689
The verb has two parts but one meaning.

57
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:27,400
What does turn up mean, by the way?

58
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,489
It means to arrive or appear.

59
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:34,579
It’s a very common verb you could use in
your spoken English!

60
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:40,569
Also, the meaning of a phrasal verb can be
totally different from the meaning of the

61
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:43,080
words which it’s made from.

62
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:51,180
For example, turn up has no connection with
the basic meaning of turn

63
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,020
Finally, many phrasal verbs have more than
one meaning.

64
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:03,750
Often, the two (or sometimes three) meanings
are completely separate.

65
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:10,770
With turn up, you can also turn up the radio,
the TV, or the volume on this video if you

66
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,260
want to make it louder!

67
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,520
So, now you know some basic information about
phrasal verbs.

68
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,780
But, what makes phrasal verbs different from
‘normal’ verbs?

69
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,760
Many English phrasal verbs have the same meaning
as another ‘normal’ one-word verb.

70
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,810
For example:

71
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:41,390
turn up --> arrive
head off --> leave

72
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,600
pick up --> buy or collect

73
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,330
Other phrasal verbs have a unique meaning.

74
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:55,270
For example, run out of, stop by or pop out
can’t be replaced with just one verb with

75
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,450
the exact same meaning.

76
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,890
Let’s practice.

77
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:06,310
Here are five phrasal verbs, and six one-word
verbs.

78
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:13,230
Can you match the phrasal verbs to the one-word
verbs with the same meanings?

79
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,020
Be careful, because there’s one extra verb,
which you don’t need!

80
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,170
We’ll give you the answers in a few seconds.

81
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:30,420
For now, pause the video if you want more
time to think about it.

82
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,860
Ready?

83
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,850
Here are the answers.

84
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,520
Even here, you need to be careful.

85
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:44,390
First, the phrasal verb and the one-word verb
might not be exactly the same.

86
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:48,070
For example, what does install mean?

87
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,530
What things can you install?

88
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:57,810
You can install household goods, like washing
machines or air conditioners.

89
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:03,500
You can also install software on your computer
or on your phone.

90
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:11,010
The phrasal verb put in only has the first
idea: you can put in a new washing machine,

91
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:17,640
but you can’t put in a new app or put in
a new operating system.

92
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:25,720
Secondly, the phrasal verb and the one-word
verb often have different registers.

93
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,560
What does that mean?

94
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,020
It means they’re used in very different
situations.

95
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,860
Let’s see why this matters:

96
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,980
Hi, Maria!

97
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,600
Glad you could attend!

98
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,490
Sorry for appearing so late.

99
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,780
I boarded the wrong bus and then I was wandering
for ages seeking your street.

100
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,910
Don’t worry about it.

101
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,400
Should I remove my shoes?

102
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,980
If you don’t mind.

103
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,110
Would you like something to drink before we
depart?

104
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,640
Tea?

105
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,180
Coffee?

106
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,690
That was part of the same dialogue you heard
before.

107
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,210
How was it different?

108
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,370
Did it sound natural to you?

109
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,800
This time, we used one-word verbs instead
of phrasal verbs in many places.

110
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,630
I hope you heard that the dialogue sounded
very strange and unnatural.

111
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:25,910
For example, a native speaker would almost
never say sentences like these:

112
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:32,760
The one-word verbs are too formal, and they
aren’t used in simple, spoken English like

113
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,160
this.

114
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,000
You need to use the phrasal verbs.

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,940
Even when phrasal verbs and one-word verbs
have the same meaning, you can’t always

116
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,280
use them in the same way.

117
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,810
Look for and seek have the same meaning, but
seek is much more formal and literary.

118
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,320
You wouldn’t use it often in conversational
English.

119
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,360
So, in spoken English, you often need to use
phrasal verbs to sound natural.

120
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,950
On the other hand, because many phrasal verbs
are more informal, they aren’t appropriate

121
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,760
in formal writing.

122
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:19,330
That said, many English learners think that
‘all phrasal verbs are informal’.

123
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,120
That isn’t true.

124
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,940
Phrasal verbs can be more formal or informal
like any other words.

125
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:33,590
For example, pop out is very informal; you
probably wouldn’t use it in written English.

126
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:39,190
Look for has a neutral tone, meaning you can
use it in any situation.

127
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:44,039
Some phrasal verbs, like draw upon, even sound
quite formal.

128
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,730
However, when you have a phrasal verb and
a one-word verb with the same meaning, like

129
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:56,690
turn up and arrive, the one-word verb is generally
more formal than the phrasal verb.

130
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,750
Now, you should know what phrasal verbs are,
how they’re different from ‘normal’

131
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,510
verbs, and when you should use phrasal verbs.

132
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:19,540
Next, let’s turn to a very important question:
how can you remember phrasal verbs?

133
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:25,209
We said before that the meaning of a phrasal
verb often has no connection to the words

134
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:26,750
which it’s made from.

135
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:33,850
For example, if you look up a new word in
the dictionary, there’s no direct connection

136
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:40,360
to the meaning of up
However, prepositions in phrasal verbs aren’t

137
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,790
totally random.

138
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:48,639
Often, the same preposition in different phrasal
verbs has a similar meaning.

139
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,089
Look at three verbs:

140
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,889
go down
cut down

141
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:56,769
turn down

142
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:01,410
The preposition down has a similar meaning
in these three verbs.

143
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:07,529
Do you know what connects them?

144
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:12,959
Perhaps it’ll be clearer if you see them
in full sentences:

145
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,749
Sales went down by 15% last year.

146
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:21,580
I’m trying to cut down on how much coffee
I drink.

147
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,350
Can you turn the TV down?

148
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,930
It’s too loud.

149
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,339
Can you see the connection now?

150
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,839
In these phrasal verbs, down has the idea
of something decreasing.

151
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,589
Let’s look at another example.

152
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:41,050
Here are three sentences:

153
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,410
He sent out hundreds of job applications.

154
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,450
They handed out immigration forms before we
landed.

155
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,000
The teacher gave out the worksheets.

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,379
These sentences contain phrasal verbs with
the preposition out.

157
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:00,990
Can you see what connects them?

158
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:07,079
These three phrasal verbs: send out, hand
out and give out all have the idea of ‘to

159
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,779
many people at one time.’

160
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:15,740
If he sent out hundreds of job applications,
then he sent many job applications, to many

161
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,130
different people, all at one time.

162
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:27,060
If the teacher gave out the worksheets, then
she gave out many worksheets to many students

163
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,079
at one time.

164
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:35,449
Again, you can see how one preposition can
have a similar meaning in different phrasal

165
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:37,290
verbs.

166
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:44,300
Learning more about prepositions and how they’re
used in phrasal verbs can help you to make

167
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:50,279
connections like these and remember phrasal
verbs more easily!

168
00:11:50,279 --> 00:12:01,350
Let’s see one more practical tip to help
you learn and remember English phrasal verbs.

169
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,029
So far, you’ve seen that:

170
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:09,180
The meaning of a phrasal verb often has no
connection to the meaning of the words which

171
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,899
it’s made of.

172
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:14,069
Phrasal verbs can have more than one meaning.

173
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:21,050
And: Using phrasal verbs correctly depends
heavily on register, not just on meaning.

174
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,889
Why are these things important for remembering
phrasal verbs?

175
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:31,509
They’re important because it’s very hard
to learn and remember phrasal verbs without

176
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:32,759
context.

177
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:40,490
For example, if you learn vocabulary by writing
down the translation in your language, and

178
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:47,480
then trying to memorise the translation, you’ll
have big problems remembering and using phrasal

179
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
verbs.

180
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,740
Actually, this is true for all vocabulary
learning, but it’s especially true with

181
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,249
phrasal verbs.

182
00:12:55,249 --> 00:13:01,279
You’ll end up with a list of verbs that
look very similar to you: look up, look up

183
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,949
to, look down on, look through, look around,
look after…

184
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:08,050
It’s too hard!

185
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,939
So, practice good vocabulary learning habits
with phrasal verbs.

186
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:16,980
Make sure you learn phrasal verbs in full
sentences.

187
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,199
If possible, the sentences should mean something
to you.

188
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:26,379
Try to take example sentences from things
you read or heard which were interesting for

189
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,199
you.

190
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:34,220
You could even take examples from conversations
you had in English, so long as you’re confident

191
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,370
you can remember the sentences correctly.

192
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:43,519
Let’s practice; here are three phrasal verbs
from this lesson:

193
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,889
come along
head off

194
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:48,029
pop out

195
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:51,369
Can you make an example sentence with each
verb?

196
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:55,089
Try to make something relevant to you and
your life.

197
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:59,589
Do it now; pause the video, and write down
your three sentences.

198
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,699
Ready?

199
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:03,699
Here are some suggestions.

200
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:06,629
Of course, your sentences will be different.

201
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:07,970
That’s fine.

202
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:14,910
However, if you’re not sure that your sentences
are correct, it’s important to check.

203
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,970
Ask a friend or a teacher.

204
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,670
Otherwise, you’ll learn the words wrong.

205
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,709
Here are our suggested sentences:

206
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:27,480
Do you want to come along to the cinema tonight?

207
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,380
It’s getting late, so I think I’ll head
off.

208
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,480
I think she’s popped out to get something
for lunch.

209
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,629
Now, you have your example sentences, and
hopefully you’ve checked that they’re

210
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:43,629
correct.

211
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:44,629
What next?

212
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:49,610
Use a digital flashcard app such as Quizlet,
or Anki.

213
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:54,839
Put your sentences in as questions with the
phrasal verbs replaced with gaps.

214
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,889
For example:
You can make the questions easier or more

215
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:03,369
difficult by removing fewer or more letters.

216
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:08,500
If you haven’t used Quizlet, Anki or anything
like that before, then we recommend checking

217
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
them out.

218
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,610
There are links below the video.

219
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,860
Also, we highly recommend making more than
one card for each verb.

220
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:22,279
For example:
Again, you can make some cards easier and

221
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:24,470
some cards more difficult.

222
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:30,230
Review your cards regularly, and you’ll
find it easy to remember English phrasal verbs,

223
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,829
because you’ll be learning them in context.

224
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:40,540
