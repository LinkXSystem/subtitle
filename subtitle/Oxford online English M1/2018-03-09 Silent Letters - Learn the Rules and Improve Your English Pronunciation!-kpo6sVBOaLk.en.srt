00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,050
Hi, I'm Kae.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,430
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,620
In this lesson, you can learn about silent
letters in English.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,750
Think about words like know, climb, or answer.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:20,519
They all have silent letters: letters which
are written, but not pronounced.

6
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,800
Do you know which letters are silent in these
three words?

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:34,190
In this lesson, you’ll learn more about
silent letters, so that your English pronunciation

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:40,540
can be clear and correct!

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:48,900
Right, so do you know any words which start
with a silent letter?

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,550
You should; there was one in the question
I just asked you!

11
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:03,240
The word know starts with a silent letter:
you say /nəʊ/ and not /knəʊ/.

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:11,820
There are other words like this, which start
with ‘kn’, but the ‘k’ is not pronounced.

13
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,570
Can you think of any?

14
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,360
Other examples are knee, knife, or knock.

15
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,320
Another common silent letter at the start
of a word is ‘h’.

16
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,670
You can see this in words like hour or honest.

17
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:36,460
Finally, what do you call a doctor who treats
mental illnesses?

18
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,979
This doctor is a psychiatrist.

19
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:47,030
In words like psychiatrist, which begin with
‘ps’, the ‘p’ is silent.

20
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,810
These words are often more academic words.

21
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,530
For example: psychology or pseudonym.

22
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:00,020
There aren’t so many everyday words starting
with ‘ps’.

23
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,750
So now you know three ways a word can start
with a silent letter:

24
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:14,080
'kn', like know, knee, knife, or knock
'h', like honest or hour

25
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,100
'ps', like psychiatrist, psychology or pseudonym

26
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,840
You can also find silent letters in the middle of a word.

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,620
Here, there are many letters which can be
silent.

28
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,860
Let’s do a test.

29
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,480
I’m going to show you five words.

30
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,620
Can you find the silent letters?

31
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,460
Do you know the answers?

32
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,620
Let’s look together.

33
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,960
The ‘b’ in debt is silent: /det/.

34
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,960
The ‘i’ in business is silent: /’bɪznəs/.

35
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,840
This is unusual, because normally, silent
letters are consonants.

36
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,989
However, vowels can sometimes be silent, too.

37
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:11,330
The ‘l’ in half is silent: /hɑːf/.

38
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,569
The ‘p’ in receipt is silent: /rə’siːt/.

39
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:21,770
And lastly, the ‘w’ in answer is silent:
/’ɑnsə/.

40
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,680
Did you get the right answers?

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:30,209
You can see that many different letters can
be silent, and that silent letters can be

42
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,010
anywhere in the word.

43
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,840
So how do you know if a letter is silent or
not?

44
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,460
With silent letters in the middle of a word,
there really aren’t any rules.

45
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:52,400
The best way is to write down the words with phonetics.

46
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,990
English spelling is not logical at all.

47
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:04,700
Using phonetics to write down vocabulary will
help you remember the correct pronunciation.

48
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:12,540
For example, if you look at the word answer,
you might try to read the ‘w’.

49
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:20,780
But if you use the phonetics, you can see
that there’s no /w/ sound: /’ɑːnsə/.

50
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,060
Let’s do some more practice.

51
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,100
Look at five more words.

52
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,139
Can you find the silent letters?

53
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:41,500
Muscle,
should, island, guitar, sword.

54
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,740
So now, you’ve seen many of the common English
words which have a silent letter in the middle.

55
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,160
You can also find silent letters at the end
of a word.

56
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,919
Here, things are a bit more regular; there
are patterns you can find.

57
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,580
What’s this?

58
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,180
Is it my /θʌm/ or my /θʌmb/?

59
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,460
It’s my thumb.

60
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,090
The ‘b’ is silent.

61
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:19,720
In other words ending –mb, the ‘b’ is
also silent: climb, limb, bomb.

62
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:27,280
There are also a few words ending –mn, and
the ‘n’ is silent, like autumn or damn.

63
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,500
Finally, there are also some French words
which are used in English, like ballet, buffet

64
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,500
or gourmet.

65
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:44,919
With these words, you use the French pronunciation,
so you say /bæ’leɪ/ and not /’bælət/.

66
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,760
What about words like rate, site, or cope?

67
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,440
Those end with a silent ‘e’, right?

68
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,520
Yes and no.

69
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,930
Sometimes, the line between a silent letter
and a non-silent letter can be hard to draw.

70
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,979
This isn’t always true: think about the
word autumn.

71
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:12,850
The ‘n’ is completely silent.

72
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,630
You could take it away and you would still
pronounce the word the same way.

73
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,950
Now, think about the word site.

74
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,759
You might say that the ‘e’ is silent.

75
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:31,100
However, if the ‘e’ wasn’t there, you
would pronounce the word /sɪt/, as in ‘sit

76
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,260
down’.

77
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,190
So sometimes, silent letters aren’t completely
silent.

78
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:44,800
‘Silent’ letters can change the pronunciation
of a word, even if you don’t pronounce the

79
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,259
letter itself.

80
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:57,940
Look at five pairs of words, and think about
how the ‘e’ on the end changes the pronunciation.

81
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,120
Let’s read the words together:

82
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,560
win/wine
us/use

83
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,580
cop/cope
her/here

84
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,580
rat/rate

85
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,760
You can see that adding ‘e’ to the end
of a word makes a big difference to the pronunciation,

86
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,840
even if you don’t actually pronounce it.

87
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:32,169
Sometimes, silent letters can make an even
bigger difference to the pronunciation of

88
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:36,240
a word.

89
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,110
You saw before that most silent letters are
consonants, but that vowels can be silent

90
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,110
letters, too.

91
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:47,979
Sometimes, a vowel can be silent and this
can mean that a word ‘loses’ a syllable.

92
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:49,300
An example?

93
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,610
Take the word restaurant.

94
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,050
It’s written with three syllables: /res
– tə - rɒnt/.

95
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,110
However, in spoken English, it usually has
two syllables: /’restrɒnt/.

96
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,550
This is a special case, because these letters
aren’t necessarily silent.

97
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,490
You could say restaurant with three syllables:
/’restərɒnt/.

98
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,910
However, most native speakers wouldn’t pronounce
the word like this.

99
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,900
Can you think of any more examples like this?

100
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,360
Let’s practise.

101
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,889
Here are five words.

102
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:24,630
Each word has one ‘silent’ syllable.

103
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,460
Which syllable might not be pronounced?

104
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:35,360
Pause the video and think about your answers
if you want!

105
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,320
Let’s look together:

106
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:44,190
In comfortable, the ‘or’ can be dropped:
/’kʌmftəbəl/.

107
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,480
In chocolate, the ‘o’ can be dropped:
/’tʃɒklət/.

108
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,990
In different, the first ‘e’ can be dropped:
/’dɪfrənt/.

109
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,579
In camera, the ‘e’ can be dropped: /’kæmrə/.

110
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:09,720
And in vegetable, you can drop the second
‘e’: /’vedʒtəbəl/

111
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,269
Remember that in all of these words, the letters
aren’t necessarily silent.

112
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:17,290
Some native speakers pronounce all of the
syllables in these words.

113
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,649
However, it’s more common to reduce these
words and make them as short as you can.

114
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:27,829
Reducing the words by dropping syllables also
makes them shorter and easier to say.

115
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:30,880
This can help you to speak more fluently!

116
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,579
Let’s review the words one more time:

117
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,480
comfortable
chocolate

118
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,020
different
camera

119
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,259
vegetable

120
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,879
You might be thinking: how do I know which
words have silent syllables?

121
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,619
How can I check?

122
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:58,070
Good questions: like many points with silent
letters, there aren’t exactly rules you

123
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,170
can follow.

124
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:08,850
However, you can check whether a word has
silent syllables or not.

125
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,189
Look the word up in a dictionary.

126
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:15,679
Look at the phonetic transcription, next to
the word.

127
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:24,509
A good dictionary will show you all the possible
pronunciations of the word, including whether

128
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:28,199
any syllables can be dropped.

129
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:30,199
So now you’ve seen how letters can be silent.

130
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:34,439
You’ve learned about common patterns with
silent letters, and you’ve seen how silent

131
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:37,350
letters can change the pronunciation of a
word.

132
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,519
You can practice this topic more on our website
where there's a quiz to help you review what

133
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,329
you've learned in this lesson.

134
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:46,440
There are also many other great free English
lessons.

135
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,920
Thanks for watching.

136
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,839
See you next time!
