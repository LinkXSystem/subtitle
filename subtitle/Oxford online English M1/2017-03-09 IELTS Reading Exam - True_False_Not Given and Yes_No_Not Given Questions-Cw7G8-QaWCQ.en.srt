00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:02,819
Hi!

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:04,620
I’m Martin.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,810
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:17,170
In this lesson, you’re going to learn how
to complete true/false/not given, and yes/no/not

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,300
given questions in the IELTS reading exam.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,359
But what is the difference between these two
types of question?

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,710
True/false/not given questions ask you about
facts.

8
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:39,690
Yes/no/not given questions can include facts
or the writer’s opinion.

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:46,530
However, you can think about these two kinds
of question in exactly the same way.

10
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,480
But, please check what type of question you’re
answering.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,579
If you write the answer ‘yes’ in a ‘true,
false, not given’ question, the answer is

12
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:00,429
obviously not correct.

13
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:04,739
This is mistake is easier to make than you
might imagine.

14
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:13,490
Let’s have a look at some techniques you
can use to answer true/false/not given questions

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,750
in your IELTS reading exam.

16
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,170
Part One: how to find the relevant part of
the text.

17
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,259
Before you can answer the question, you need
to find the right part of the text.

18
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,210
First, remember that the questions follow
the text.

19
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:42,430
That means that for the first question, you
should start looking near the beginning of

20
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,770
the text.

21
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,020
Now, let’s do an example.

22
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,010
Imagine that you see this question:

23
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:59,420
"Zander cannot live in salt water."

24
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,159
Probably, your first thought is, “What’s
a zander?”

25
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,280
Perfectly reasonable.

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,630
I had to look it up, too!

27
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:17,840
However, you know that the zander is something
which can (or can’t) live in salt water.

28
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
What lives in water?

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,770
Many things, but we know the zander must be
some kind of animal or plant which lives in

30
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,770
water.

31
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:33,840
So, look for words in the text related to
fish or sea life.

32
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,370
You can also look for the word 'zander', obviously.

33
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,600
Also, the question mentions salt water.

34
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,520
Where do you find salt water?

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,860
In the sea, right?

36
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,050
So, look for words like sea, ocean etc.

37
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,670
What’s the opposite of salt water?

38
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,080
It’s fresh water.

39
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,340
Where do you find fresh water?

40
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,510
Mostly in rivers and lakes.

41
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:04,650
If the answer is ‘true’, and zander cannot
live in salt water, then they must live in

42
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,710
fresh water.

43
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:12,970
This means you should also look for references
to fresh water in the text, so look for words

44
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,940
like river or lake.

45
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,680
Let’s do one more example.

46
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,580
You see this question:

47
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,980
"Before 1900, there were no zander in the
UK."

48
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,420
What should you look for in the text?

49
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,560
Look for dates or time references.

50
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:43,680
The question mentions 1900, so you could look
for time expressions like 19th century, 20th

51
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,780
century, turn of the century, and so on.

52
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,960
You could also look for references to the
UK or parts of the UK.

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,510
This means you should look for words like
Britain, England, Scotland, etc.

54
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:07,250
Use these techniques to find the section in
the text which will let you answer the question.

55
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,540
Okay, so now you’ve found the relevant part
of the text.

56
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,740
What next?

57
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,780
Part two: finding key ideas in the text.

58
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,930
Take a look at this extract from a text.

59
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:31,220
"The zander is a type of fish, thought originally
to be from Western Europe.

60
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,260
Zander were introduced into the UK in the
late 20th century, and now can be found in

61
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,940
many rivers and freshwater lakes around the
UK.

62
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:51,100
Scientists claim that zander have harmed many
native English fish species since their introduction."

63
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,960
Pause the video if you want extra time to
read it.

64
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,820
What should you focus on here?

65
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,640
Here are a few things to look for and think
about:

66
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,610
First, look for time and date references.

67
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,130
The statement says 'late 20th century'.

68
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,840
What does that mean?

69
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,150
1990?

70
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,000
Is 2000 late 20th century?

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,600
When does late start?

72
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,440
Is 1970 late 20th century?

73
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:33,980
Secondly, look for expressions of quantity
like 'all', 'many', 'some', 'most', and so

74
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,980
on.

75
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,900
Here, the text says 'many rivers and freshwater
lakes'.

76
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,990
Does that mean all zander live in rivers?

77
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,760
Does it tell you whether zander are more common
in rivers or lakes?

78
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,810
Thirdly, look for specific details and facts.

79
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:59,250
What do you know for sure after reading this
text?

80
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:06,360
You know that the zander is a fish, and that
there weren’t any zander in the UK before

81
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,390
1950 (because they were introduced).

82
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:15,610
You know that zander live in rivers and freshwater
lakes in the UK.

83
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:22,490
Those are the only facts in the text, so they're
the only things you can be sure about.

84
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:30,889
To do well with IELTS true/false/not given
questions, you need to separate fact from

85
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:32,460
speculation.

86
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,210
Finally, look for expressions of uncertainty.

87
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,490
This is the opposite of the point we just
mentioned.

88
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,400
Look for modal verbs like 'could', 'might'
or 'must'.

89
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,461
Look for expressions which indicate uncertainty,
for example 'it is thought that…' or 'many

90
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:55,260
experts believe that…'

91
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:00,950
For example, the text says that zander are
thought to be from Western Europe.

92
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:08,150
Does that mean they are definitely from Western
Europe, or is it uncertain?

93
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:16,010
The text says that scientists claim that zander
have harmed many native English fish species.

94
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:25,180
From this, can you say for sure that zander
have damaged English wildlife?

95
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:32,000
Of course, the exact points you consider depend
on the question you’re trying to answer.

96
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:40,110
However, it’s good practice to think about
these different things when you’re preparing

97
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,750
for your IELTS reading test.

98
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:50,640
To get a high score, you need really good
attention to detail.

99
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,889
Part three: how to answer true/false/not given
questions.

100
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:02,300
Let’s do a few questions together to practise.

101
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:08,840
First I’m going to give you the statement
which you need to read, then I’ll give you

102
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,460
the part of the text where you would find
the answer.

103
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:20,080
All you have to do is decide if the statement
is true, false, or not given.

104
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,160
Here’s your first statement.

105
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,320
Read it and think about what you could be
looking for.

106
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:36,760
"Bananas became popular as soon as they were
brought to Europe."

107
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,729
Here is the text:

108
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:47,830
"After their introduction to Europe bananas
were an immediate sensation and became a staple

109
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,840
in many people’s diets."

110
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,930
So, what do you think?

111
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,610
Is the statement true, false or not given?

112
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,630
It’s true.

113
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:11,190
The text says 'immediate sensation' and the
statement says that 'bananas were popular

114
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:16,000
as soon as they were brought to Europe'.

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,820
These are exactly the same thing.

116
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:24,660
Even if you don’t know the exact meaning
of 'sensation' or 'staple', you could still

117
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,110
could still make a good guess based on:

118
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,110
1.

119
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,640
The link between 'as soon as' and 'immediate'.

120
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,790
2.

121
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,260
'Many people’s diets'.

122
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,430
Even if you don’t know what 'staple' means,
you can hopefully work out that many people

123
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,890
were eating bananas.

124
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,260
That allows you to say that bananas were popular.

125
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,570
Let’s do one more.

126
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,390
Here’s the statement:

127
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:01,750
"Capsaicin can irreversibly damage the mouth."

128
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,040
And here’s the relevant sentence from the
text.

129
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:16,140
"Capsaicin, found in chili peppers, causes
temporary irritation of the cells in the mouth."

130
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,070
Do you know what capsaicin is?

131
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,070
Does it matter?

132
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,810
Not really.

133
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:30,760
Even if you have no idea what capsaicin is,
you can still be sure that this one is false.

134
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,500
How can you be sure?

135
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:39,740
If something is irreversibly damaged, then
it’s permanent; the text says it is only

136
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,670
temporary irritation.

137
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,730
Therefore, it has to be false.

138
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,430
Let’s do another one.

139
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,940
Here’s the statement:

140
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,110
"Bananas can be part of a parrot's diet.

141
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,110
"

142
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,460
And here’s the text:

143
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:08,541
"Parrots must compete with larger animals,
such as monkeys, for the available food, and

144
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,800
especially fruit.

145
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,149
Larger fruits, such as bananas, are mostly
consumed by monkeys, who can reach them easily

146
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:19,680
by climbing."

147
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,850
What do you think?

148
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:32,660
The text doesn’t say that parrots eat bananas,
but the statement includes the word 'can'.

149
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:39,110
Is there anything in the text which tells
us that it’s possible for parrots to eat

150
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,850
bananas?

151
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,490
No, there isn’t.

152
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:48,560
We know that parrots eat fruit, and that bananas
are mostly consumed by monkeys.

153
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:55,610
The text suggests strongly that parrots can
eat bananas, but it doesn’t directly say

154
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,670
so.

155
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:01,600
So, the answer is ‘not given’.

156
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,180
Be careful with questions like these.

157
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:10,000
It’s natural to read something like this
and guess that parrots can eat bananas.

158
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,180
It’s reasonable to guess—the text does
suggest this.

159
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:25,900
However, your answers must be based on what
the text says or doesn’t say.

160
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:31,910
Part four: how to answer yes/no/not given
questions.

161
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:38,750
So, you’ve seen how to answer some true/false/not
given questions.

162
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:44,670
Now we’ll look at some yes/no/not given
questions.

163
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:49,620
Remember, you can approach these in the same
way.

164
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:56,960
The only difference is that yes/no/not given
questions may also include the writer’s

165
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
opinions.

166
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,339
Here’s a text.

167
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:06,720
Pause the video to read it if you need extra
time.

168
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:15,920
"Wainwright’s, established in 1863, are
now among the leading exporters of glass tankards

169
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,060
and other glass products anywhere in the Northern
hemisphere.

170
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:28,529
Although not immediately profitable, the company,
now based in Chicago, has grown prodigiously

171
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:35,510
into a brand whose elegant receptacles are
widely sought after and admired by many.

172
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,510
"

173
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,510
Alright?

174
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,630
Here’s your first statement:

175
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:46,260
"Wainwright’s success was instantaneous."

176
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,240
'Instantaneous' has the same meaning as 'immediate'.

177
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:58,570
We know Wainwright’s brand is now sought
after (well-known and wanted by people), but

178
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:03,140
also that it was not immediately profitable.

179
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:09,560
The statement says 'instantaneous success',
but our text says Wainwright’s wasn’t

180
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,110
immediately profitable.

181
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,180
If a company isn’t profitable, is it a success?

182
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,180
No.

183
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,910
So, you should choose ‘no.’

184
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,800
Question number two:

185
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,519
"Wainwright’s is one of the leading exporters
in North America."

186
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,710
The text tells us Wainwright’s is one of
the leading exporters of glass tankards and

187
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:44,190
products in the northern hemisphere, which
includes North America.

188
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:52,830
However, the statement just says 'leading
exporters', while the text says leading exporters

189
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:57,080
of glass tankards and other glass products.

190
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:04,720
So, we know that Wainwright’s is a leading
exporter in one particular area, but we don’t

191
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,200
know if it’s one of the biggest exporters
overall.

192
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,860
What should we choose in this situation?

193
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,310
The correct answer is ‘not given’.

194
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:26,540
There’s nothing in the text which tells
you how Wainwright’s compares to other companies

195
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,990
in different sectors.

196
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,310
Question number three:

197
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:39,490
"Wainwright’s was founded in Chicago."

198
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,149
What is this statement asking us?

199
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:51,050
The text tells us Wainwright’s is based
in Chicago now, but does that mean it started

200
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,620
in Chicago?

201
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:00,770
If it is now based in Chicago, that means
it was set up somewhere else, otherwise why

202
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,649
would the text use the word 'now'?

203
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:09,460
The answer must be no.

204
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,440
Our last question:

205
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,540
"Many people own Wainwright’s glass products."

206
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:23,149
Okay, let’s focus on the word 'own' here.

207
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:31,410
The text tells you the tankards are admired
and sought after by many people, which suggests

208
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,490
that they are popular products.

209
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:41,570
We also know that the company is successful,
which also strongly suggests that many people

210
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,700
buy and own their products.

211
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:53,480
However, does it say anything about people
owning Wainwright’s products?

212
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,040
Remember that ‘suggests’ is not enough.

213
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:04,850
We need something concrete in the text that
tells us that many people own Wainwright’s

214
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,610
glass products.

215
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:17,159
There isn’t anything like that in the text,
so we should select ‘not given.’

216
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:20,509
Part 5: final tips.

217
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:29,039
Hopefully you are feeling a little more confident
answering true/false/not given and yes/no/not

218
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,480
given questions.

219
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,210
Here are just a few more things to remember:

220
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,010
1.

221
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:45,289
There will always be at least one true, one
false and one not given answer.

222
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:48,830
If you are missing one, one answer has to
be wrong.

223
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:56,149
The same is true for yes/no/not given questions:
there will always be at least one of each

224
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:57,529
answer.

225
00:17:57,529 --> 00:17:58,919
2.

226
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:04,409
If you aren’t sure, or you can’t find
an answer, put ‘not given’.

227
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:06,600
You don’t have a lot of time for this exam.

228
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,669
Don’t spend all your time looking for an
answer that isn’t there.

229
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:13,749
3.

230
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:15,580
Answer all the questions!

231
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:21,159
Never leave blank spaces, even if you’re
running out of time or you have no idea.

232
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:27,900
You have a one in three chance of guessing
correctly, so always put an answer for every

233
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,900
question.

234
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,350
Well, that’s all from me.

235
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,279
Good luck if you have an IELTS exam coming
soon!

236
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:39,990
Thanks a lot for watching.

237
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,929
See you next time!
