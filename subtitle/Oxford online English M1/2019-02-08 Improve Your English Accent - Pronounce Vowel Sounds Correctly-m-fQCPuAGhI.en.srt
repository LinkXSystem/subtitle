00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,670
Hi, I’m Lori.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,360
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:11,040
In this lesson, you can learn about English
vowel sounds, and how to pronounce them.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,300
This lesson will give you an overview.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:20,410
You’ll see what vowel sounds exist in English,
how to pronounce them, and common spelling

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,480
patterns for each one.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,860
First question: how many vowel sounds are
there in English?

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,430
There are many answers to this question!

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,920
It depends how you define a single vowel sound,
and whether you consider sounds which are

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,839
very close to each other to be one sound or
two sounds.

11
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:50,239
It also depends if you’re talking about
British or American English, because there

12
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,270
are some vowel sounds which exist in one but
not in the other.

13
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:04,050
For this lesson, there are 21 vowel sounds:
eight short vowel sounds, five long vowel

14
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,140
sounds, and eight diphthongs.

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,920
Diphthongs are double vowel sounds.

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,380
/æ/

17
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:25,220
sat, happy, jazz, catch

18
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,340
/æ/

19
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:37,300
sat, happy, jazz, catch

20
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:44,540
Spelling is easy for the /æ/ sound: it’s
always produced by the letter ‘a’, although

21
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:50,960
Although, be careful, because the letter ‘a’ can
also produce other sounds.

22
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,940
The /æ/ sound is different in British and
American English.

23
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:03,860
In British English, it’s a true short vowel,
so your mouth stays in one position to produce

24
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,250
the sound.

25
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,300
In American English, it’s more like a diphthong.

26
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:16,240
The sound is slightly longer, and your mouth
moves to produce the sound.

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,380
/e/

28
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:29,020
leg, best, head, says

29
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:34,400
/e/

30
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,340
leg, best, head, says

31
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,260
The /e/ sound is normally produced by the
letter ‘e’ by itself, although some other

32
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:57,020
spellings are possible, like ‘ea’ or the
‘ay’ in ‘says’.

33
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,740
/ə/

34
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:09,800
around, polite, situation, Saturday, driver

35
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,440
/ə/

36
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:23,780
around, polite, situation, Saturday, driver

37
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:31,000
The /ə/ sound is very common and can be produced
by many, many different spellings.

38
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:39,269
It’s easier to think about stress when you’re
trying to find /ə/ sounds; the /ə/ sound

39
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:48,920
is never stressed, and it often appears before
or after the stressed syllable in a word.

40
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,280
/ɪ/

41
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:03,260
bit, limit, Italy, busy, explore

42
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:09,280
/ɪ/

43
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,720
bit, limit, Italy, busy, explore

44
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,699
The /ɪ/ sound is also very common, and like
the schwa sound, which we just talked about,

45
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:31,490
it often appears before or after a stressed
syllable, so it can have many different spellings.

46
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:36,949
However, it’s often produced by a letter
‘i’ by itself.

47
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:44,180
/i/ is slightly different, because it’s
an intermediate sound which only appears in

48
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,360
very specific places.

49
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:54,250
It’s between /ɪ/ and /iː/, and it’s
produced when a word ends in a consonant plus

50
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,470
the letter ‘y’.

51
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:03,500
busy, angry, hungry, silly

52
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:12,640
busy, angry, hungry, silly

53
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,320
/ɒ/

54
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:26,200
hot, clock, what, cough, Austria

55
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,860
/ɒ/

56
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:39,040
hot, clock, what, cough, Austria

57
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:46,160
The /ɒ/ sound is often produced by a letter
‘o’ by itself.

58
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:51,330
A few other spellings are possible, like ‘a’
in some words.

59
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:58,169
The /ɒ/ sound is also different in American
and British English.

60
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:05,330
In British English, the sound is pronounced
with the mouth more closed, and it’s usually

61
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,860
shorter.

62
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:15,099
In American English, the /ɒ/ sound is pronounced
with the mouth slightly more open and relaxed,

63
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:18,060
and the sound is more nasal.

64
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,850
The sound is often slightly longer.

65
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,220
/ʌ/

66
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:36,560
luck, butter, brother, London, enough

67
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,860
/ʌ/

68
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:50,200
luck, butter, brother, London, enough

69
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,460
The /ʌ/ sound can be produced by a letter
‘u’ by itself.

70
00:06:55,469 --> 00:07:03,129
However, there are also many words where a
letter ‘o’ produces the /ʌ/ sound in

71
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:05,729
a stressed syllable.

72
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:11,480
Other possible spellings are ‘ou’ and
‘oo’.

73
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,540
/ʊ/

74
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:23,560
put, look, full, good, should

75
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,180
/ʊ/

76
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:36,120
put, look, full, good, should

77
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:45,080
The /ʊ/ sound can be produced by a letter
‘u’ by itself, but also by ‘oo’.

78
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:53,200
Sometimes, the letters ‘ou’ together can
make an /ʊ/ sound, though this is less common.

79
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Next, let’s look at the five long vowel
sounds.

80
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,380
/aː/

81
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:15,060
father, calm, part, hard

82
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:21,400
/aː/

83
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,780
father, calm, part, hard

84
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,360
The /aː/ sound is very different in British
and American English.

85
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:38,240
Specifically, it’s much more common in British
English.

86
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:46,550
Many words which have the long /aː/ sound
in British English have an /æ/ sound in American

87
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,930
English.

88
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:55,800
For example: ‘after’, ‘asked’, ‘France’,
or ‘bath’.

89
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:04,690
Also, in British English, this vowel sound
is often produced by the letters ‘ar’.

90
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:12,730
In these words, the ‘r’ is not pronounced:
‘part’, ‘hard’, ‘car’, ‘dark’.

91
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:19,780
However, in American English, the ‘r’
is pronounced in these words: ‘part,’

92
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,460
‘hard,’ ‘car,’ ‘dark’.

93
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,100
This makes the vowel sound shorter.

94
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,880
/ɜː/

95
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:42,940
person, circle, work, burn, research

96
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:48,360
/ɜː/

97
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:56,740
person, circle, work, burn, research

98
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:03,380
The /ɜː/ sound has many possible spellings,
but almost all possible spellings contain

99
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,230
a vowel plus the letter ‘r’.

100
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:15,870
For example, the /ɜː/ sound can be produced
by the letters ‘er’, ‘ir’, ‘or’

101
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,570
or ‘ur’.

102
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:24,470
Like with the long /aː/ sound, the ‘r’
after the vowel is not pronounced in British

103
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:30,300
English, but it is pronounced in American
English.

104
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,040
/iː/

105
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:46,080
she, recent, week, sleep, leave, people

106
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,700
/iː/

107
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:59,880
she, recent, week, sleep, leave, people

108
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:09,490
The /iː/ sound can be produced by the letters
‘e’, ‘ee’, or ‘ea’.

109
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:17,320
There are some less common spellings, like
the ‘eo’ in ‘people’, or the ‘ey’

110
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,740
in ‘key’.

111
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:26,120
/ɔː/

112
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:33,820
boring, explore, born, course, board

113
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,120
/ɔː/

114
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:48,240
boring, explore, born, course, board

115
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:57,700
The /ɔː/ sound can be produced by the letters
‘or’, ‘our’, or ‘oar’.

116
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:02,880
This sound is much more common in British
English, and there are many more possible

117
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,480
spellings.

118
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,670
For example, the words ‘already’, ‘law’,
‘daughter’, and ‘thought’ all have

119
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,160
the /ɔː/ sound in British English.

120
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:25,250
In American English, these words would generally
be pronounced with a shorter /a/ sound: ‘already’,

121
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,310
‘law’, ‘daughter’, ‘thought’.

122
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:37,079
Also, like the other long vowel sounds you’ve
seen, the ‘r’ after a vowel is pronounced

123
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,980
in American English, but not in British English.

124
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,960
/ʊː/

125
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:57,060
food, move, suit, group, rude, blue

126
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,820
/ʊː/

127
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:12,800
food, move, suit, group, rude, blue

128
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:24,040
The /ʊː/ sound can be produced by many spellings:
‘oo’, ‘o’, ‘ui’, ‘ou’, ‘u’

129
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,360
and ‘ue’ are all possible and relatively
common.

130
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:40,420
There are other, less common possibilities
too, like the ‘ough’ in ‘through’.

131
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,940
/aɪ/

132
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:57,180
quite, tired, shy, my, night, tight

133
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:02,680
/aɪ/

134
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:11,360
quite, tired, shy, my, night, tight

135
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:19,240
The /aɪ/ sound is commonly produced by the
letters ‘i’, ‘y’, or ‘igh’.

136
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:27,680
Other possible spellings include ‘ie’,
as in ‘die’ or ‘tie’, and ‘uy’,

137
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,740
like ‘buy’ or ‘guy’.

138
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:37,550
There are also words like ‘height’ or
‘eyes’ which have an unusual spelling,

139
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:42,680
but also have the /aɪ/ sound.

140
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,300
/eɪ/

141
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:55,760
take, late, rain, wait, day, grey

142
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,440
/eɪ/

143
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:10,880
take, late, rain, wait, day, grey

144
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,100
The /eɪ/ sound has many possible spellings,
although it is most often produced by the

145
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,060
letter ‘a’.

146
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:27,170
However, it can also be produced by the letters
‘ai’, ‘ay’, ‘ey’, or ‘ea’

147
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,769
as in ‘break’.

148
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:34,900
The spelling ‘eigh’ also makes an /eɪ/
sound, like ‘eight’, ‘weight’, or

149
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,840
‘neighbour’.

150
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,600
/əʊ/

151
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:52,800
old, hope, boat, toast, know, snow

152
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,700
/əʊ/

153
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:05,220
old, hope, boat, toast, know, snow

154
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:12,399
The /əʊ/ sound is most often produced by
the letter ‘o’, although there are also

155
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:18,110
many words with ‘oa’ and ‘ow’.

156
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:28,160
Less common spellings include ‘ou’, like
‘soul’, or ‘ough’, like ‘although’.

157
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,040
/aʊ/

158
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,120
cow, town, sound, mountain

159
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,780
/aʊ/

160
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:51,740
cow, town, sound, mountain

161
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,920
Compared to the other sounds in this section,
this one is simpler!

162
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:03,079
It generally has two possible spellings: ‘ow’
and ‘ou’.

163
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:09,750
There are a few words with ‘ough’ which
have the /aʊ/ sound, like ‘drought’,

164
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,920
but these are rare.

165
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,100
/ɔɪ/

166
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:26,880
enjoy, toy, boil, avoid, lawyer

167
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,220
/ɔɪ/

168
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:39,300
enjoy, toy, boil, avoid, lawyer

169
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:47,100
The /ɔɪ/ sound is also relatively simple:
it’s spelled with ‘oi’ or ‘oy’.

170
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:53,670
Even better, these spellings don’t have
other pronunciations; if you see a word written

171
00:17:53,670 --> 00:18:04,020
with ‘oi’ or ‘oy’, you can be 99.9%
sure it’s pronounced with the /ɔɪ/ sound.

172
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:09,080
‘Lawyer’ has the /ɔɪ/ sound, although
it’s spelling is strange.

173
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:19,680
It’s the only common word which has this
sound and isn’t written with ‘oi’ or 'oy'.

174
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,860
/ɪə/

175
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:34,000
here, sphere, deer, beer, near, experience

176
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,820
/ɪə/

177
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:50,200
here, sphere, deer, beer, near, experience

178
00:18:50,200 --> 00:19:01,140
The /ɪə/ sound can be produced by many spellings:
‘ere’, ‘eer, ‘ear’ and ‘ie’

179
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,590
are all possible.

180
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:08,310
It can also be produced by the letters ‘ea’,
as in ‘idea’, or sometimes by a single

181
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:14,880
‘e’; for example ‘zero’ or ‘serious’.

182
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,020
/eə/

183
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:30,940
hair, repair, where, care, pear, bear

184
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:36,920
/eə/

185
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:45,140
hair, repair, where, care, pear, bear

186
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:53,900
The /eə/ sound also has many possible spellings;
it can be written with ‘ai’, ‘ere’,

187
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,380
‘are’ or ‘ear’.

188
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:04,900
Be careful, because some of these spellings
can also produce an /ɪə/ sound, like ’ere’

189
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,240
or ‘ear’.

190
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,350
Less commonly, the /eə/ sound is spelled
‘ar’.

191
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:18,600
Although there aren’t many words like this,
it includes some very common words and names,

192
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:25,560
like ‘parents’, ‘Sarah’ or ‘Mary’.

193
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,960
/ʊə/

194
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:40,360
sure, cure, rural, furious, Europe, tourist

195
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:46,080
/ʊə/

196
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:59,860
sure, cure, rural, furious, Europe, tourist

197
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:07,360
The /ʊə/ sound is rare, and is disappearing
in many parts of the world, which is why we’ve

198
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,809
put it last.

199
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:17,410
Often, words which could be pronounced with
an /ʊə/ sound now have an /ɔː/ or /ʊː/

200
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,690
sound instead.

201
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:27,770
For example, the word ‘sure’ is commonly
pronounced two ways: /ʃʊə/ and /ʃɔː/.

202
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:35,480
In terms of spelling, the /ʊə/ sound can
be produced by the spellings ‘u’, ‘ure’,

203
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,240
'or', or ‘eu’.

204
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:46,670
The letters ‘our’ can make an /ʊə/ sound,
as in ‘tourist’, but this spelling more

205
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,870
often makes an /ɔː/ sound.

206
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:57,159
Now, you’ve seen pronunciation and spelling
for all 21 vowel sounds in English!

207
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:07,419
Finally, let’s look at some tips to help
you pronounce vowel sounds more accurately.

208
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:11,090
Tip one: learn to ignore spelling.

209
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,440
If you’ve learned one thing from this lesson,
it should be that you can’t easily know

210
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,020
the pronunciation of a vowel sound from the
spelling.

211
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:27,510
When you learn a new word, or you want to
check the pronunciation of a word, look for

212
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,530
the phonetic script.

213
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:38,350
Phonetic script is clear and consistent, whereas
written English is not.

214
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:44,980
In our experience, many students have difficulties
with pronunciation not because they can’t

215
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:52,179
pronounce the sounds correctly, but because
they get confused by the spelling of the word.

216
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:59,240
Ignore the spelling; learn to focus on the
phonetics instead!

217
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,850
Tip two: focus on differentiating short and
long vowels.

218
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:11,670
Often, it doesn’t matter so much if you
pronounce a sound differently to native speakers.

219
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:18,150
After all, native speakers don’t pronounce
the same sounds in the same way.

220
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:24,530
However, the difference between short and
long vowels is important.

221
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:30,800
But, how can you check if you’re pronouncing
the sounds correctly?

222
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:37,110
Take a pair of words which have almost the
same pronunciation, except one has a short

223
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,929
vowel and the other has a long vowel.

224
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:48,490
For example: ‘bit’ and ‘beat’, or
‘shut’ and ‘shoot’.

225
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:54,460
When you pronounce the word with the long
vowel, you should be able to hold the vowel

226
00:23:54,460 --> 00:24:05,480
sound for as long as you want, like this:
be-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-eat.

227
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,080
sh-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot.

228
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,960
Try it!

229
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,470
When you pronounce the word with the short
vowel, it should be impossible to hold the

230
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,560
vowel sound.

231
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:27,130
When you say ‘bit’, the vowel sound is
single release of sound; you can’t hold

232
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,160
it: ‘bit’, ‘bit’.

233
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:37,770
If you can hold the short vowel sound, then
you’re not pronouncing it correctly; you’re

234
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,840
probably making the long sound instead.

235
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:49,039
Of course, you don’t want to make your vowel
sounds so long when you speak, but when you’re

236
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,110
practising, this is a useful trick.

237
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:57,200
Tip three: pay attention to mouth shape.

238
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,600
Every one of these vowel sounds is produced
in a specific way.

239
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:10,580
You need to use your throat, tongue, teeth,
lips and cheeks in different ways to make

240
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,460
different sounds.

241
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:18,690
For example, the long /iː/ sound needs you
to use your cheeks.

242
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:27,399
You need to have some tension here
On the other hand, the short /ɪ/ sound can’t

243
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:31,020
be pronounced if your cheeks are tense.

244
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:39,140
Your cheeks and lips need to be relaxed to
make this sound: /ɪ/.

245
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,260
The point is that this isn’t magic.

246
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:49,180
There’s a specific set of things you need
to do to pronounce a particular sound.

247
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,730
You can learn and practice those things if
you want to.

248
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,549
Tip four: keep diphthongs fast and minimal.

249
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:04,850
Many English learners find diphthongs difficult,
especially /əʊ/, and sometimes others like

250
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:09,180
/aɪ/ or /eɪ/, depending on their native
language.

251
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:17,299
Often, they learn to pronounce the diphthong
in a slow, exaggerated way which sounds quite

252
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:19,070
unnatural.

253
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:25,289
It can be useful to exaggerate a sound when
you’re learning to produce it correctly,

254
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:31,400
but you also need to learn to make the sound
naturally, without needing a lot of time or

255
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,500
effort.

256
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:39,780
When you’re practising the pronunciation
of diphthongs, try to move through the sound

257
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:45,160
quickly, and move your mouth as little as
you need to.

258
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:52,220
Finally, a question for you: which vowel sounds
do you find most difficult to pronounce in

259
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,990
English?

260
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,210
Let us know in the comments!

261
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,330
Thanks for watching!

262
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,700
