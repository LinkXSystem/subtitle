Hi, I’m Olivier.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,400
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,740
In this lesson, you can learn to talk about
everyday problems.

4
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:14,750
You’ll hear a story of a bad day, and see
different phrases you can use to describe

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,040
everyday problems.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,740
I had the *worst* day yesterday.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,540
I slept horribly.

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,660
I was tossing and turning all night.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,740
I had insomnia.

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,420
I finally got to sleep about five in the
morning.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,980
But then…

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,880
I overslept.

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,520
I missed my alarm.

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,080
I slept through my alarm.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,160
On the way to work, the traffic was awful.

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,300
I was sitting in traffic for an hour.

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,160
My car broke down.

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,240
I had to wait for an hour for the tow truck,
and I was late for work.

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,480
A tow truck is a vehicle which can transport
a car.

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,970
If your car has broken down, and it can’t
drive anywhere, you’ll need to call a tow

21
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,560
truck to bring it to a garage.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,680
At work, I got in a huge argument with one
of my colleagues.

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,600
We have a big deadline coming, so we’re
all under a lot of pressure.

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,740
I was working late, and I spilled coffee all
over some important papers.

25
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,620
I had to stay really late to finish everything.

26
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:47,399
I couldn’t concentrate and I got frustrated.

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,240
On the way home, I missed the last train.

28
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,640
I couldn’t find my keys.

29
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,460
I was locked out.

30
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,760
I finally got home, and saw that my flatmate
had eaten my leftovers.

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,760
There was nothing to eat for dinner, and it
was too late to buy anything.

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,780
Finally, to cap it all, I dropped my phone
down the toilet.

33
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:20,360
‘To cap it all’ is a phrase to introduce
the last bad thing in a list of bad things.

34
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,720
It means something like ‘even worse’.

35
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,840
That’s our bad day!

36
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,440
What about you?

37
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,820
Here’s a task for you: have these things
happened to you recently?

38
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,670
Try to use the phrases you saw in this lesson
to describe a bad day you've had.

39
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,300
Can you think of other everyday problems we
haven’t mentioned?

40
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,030
Share your ideas in the comments.

41
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,780
Thanks for watching!
