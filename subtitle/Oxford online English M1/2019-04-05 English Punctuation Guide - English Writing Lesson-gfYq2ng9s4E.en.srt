Hi, I’m Kasia.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,840
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,200
In this lesson, you can learn about English
punctuation.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,640
You’ll see the most common punctuation marks
in English, what they’re called, and how

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,930
to use them.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,609
This lesson has many sections.

7
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:24,500
If you want, you can just watch the sections
you need.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,280
Using punctuation correctly is critical for
your English writing.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:36,300
Punctuation problems can make a bad impression
or lead to misunderstandings.

14
00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:00,780
But first, let’s look at one of the most
basic English punctuation marks.

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,480
A full stop is also called a period in American
English.

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,910
Use a full stop at the end of a full sentence.

17
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:15,010
Don’t put a space before the full stop;
put one after.

18
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:22,320
A full sentence could be short and simple,
like this: ‘I got there early.’

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:30,060
A full sentence could also be longer and more
complex, like this: ‘Although my train arrived

20
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,430
late, and I was sure I wouldn’t make it
on time, I actually got there slightly early.’

21
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:43,190
Be careful; the idea of a ‘full sentence’
is not flexible, and it depends on the grammatical

22
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,550
structure of the sentence.

23
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:51,200
For example, can you see the mistake in this
sentence?

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,980
The first part, which ends with the word ‘there’,
is a full sentence.

25
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:03,120
You can’t choose to put a comma and continue;
you need a full stop, or a semicolon, or you

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,160
need to add a conjunction.

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,000
Learning about sentence structure, and how
to make clauses into longer sentences, is

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,170
important if you want to use English punctuation
correctly.

29
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:24,570
Full stops are also used in some abbreviations—when
you make words shorter.

30
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,620
There are three kinds of abbreviation.

31
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:35,610
One: abbreviations which *never* have full
stops, like ‘BBC’, ‘CIA’ or ‘UN’.

32
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:43,740
Two: abbreviations which *always* use full
stops, like ‘e.g.’, ‘i.e.’ or ‘etc.’

33
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,940
Three… wait, can you guess?

34
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:55,030
Some abbreviations are sometimes written with
full stops, and sometimes without.

35
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:01,000
For example, mister, doctor, or AM and PM
for talking about the time.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,459
Titles, like ‘mister’, ‘Mrs’ or ‘doctor’,
are generally written without a full stop

37
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:14,920
in British English, and with one in American
English.

38
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:22,120
In British English, it’s more common to
write AM and PM in lower-case letters with

39
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,350
full stops.

40
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:30,550
In American English, it’s more common to
use capital letters and no full stops.

41
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:40,500
However, both forms are commonly used and
you can choose which you prefer.

42
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,520
Commas have three main jobs.

43
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,590
Two of them are very simple.

44
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:53,510
First, use a comma to separate items in a
list, like this: ‘Their house has two bedrooms,

45
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,310
a large living room, two bathrooms and a terrace.’

46
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,660
After each item in your list, put a comma.

47
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:08,440
Use the word ‘and’ between the last two
items on your list: ‘To make this, you’ll

48
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,150
need eggs, flour and sugar.’

49
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,800
You can choose to put a comma before ‘and’
or not.

50
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,019
Both styles are possible!

51
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:24,999
You also need a comma with certain conjunctions,
particularly ‘and’, ‘but’, ‘so’

52
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,990
and ‘or’.

53
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:32,620
For example: ‘You can ask her, but I don’t
think she’ll agree.’

54
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:38,870
‘I won’t be there till ten, so don’t
wait for me.’

55
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,400
The last way to use commas is also the most
complicated.

56
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:52,770
Use a comma—or often two commas, in a pair—to
add non-essential information to your sentence.

57
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,310
What does ‘non-essential’ mean?

58
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,800
It means that you could remove the information,
and the sentence would still make sense and

59
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,120
have the same basic meaning.

60
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,849
This is common when you use an adverb or linking
phrase at the start of a sentence.

61
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:19,940
For example: ‘Apparently, he’s been suffering
from depression for several years.’

62
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:27,620
It’s also common when you add extra information
in the middle of a sentence, like this: ‘Yakutsk,

63
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:37,389
which is in northern Siberia, has the coldest
winters of any city in the world.’

64
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:44,749
Colons have one main job: they introduce examples,
explanations or details.

65
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:51,600
Look at one example: ‘Rapid urbanisation
has led to multiple problems: congestion,

66
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,360
air pollution and a shortage of affordable
housing for families.’

67
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:05,219
Here, the sentence before the colon mentions
a general idea—multiple problems—and the

68
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:11,500
sentence after the colon explains what these
problems are.

69
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,620
This is very common with colons; you mention
something general before the colon, then you

70
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,800
explain it in more detail after the colon.

71
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,430
Let’s see two more examples of this: ‘I
can promise you one thing: you won’t regret

72
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,780
your decision.’

73
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:39,660
‘He left all of his money to his best friend
in the whole world: his cat.’

74
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,139
Semicolons are most similar to a full stop.

75
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,100
They’re used at the end of a full sentence.

76
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,300
So, what’s the difference?

77
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:56,300
Using a semicolon shows that your ideas before
and after the semicolon are connected.

78
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,270
For example: ‘He’s so stubborn; it’s
impossible to convince him to change his ideas

79
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,430
even a little.’

80
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:11,669
Here, you have two sentences, but they’re
both talking about the same idea: him and

81
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:13,639
his stubborn character.

82
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,319
The semicolon emphasises that the ideas are
connected.

83
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,689
You never *need* to use a semicolon, but they
can be very useful.

84
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:29,689
Using a semicolon is a very easy way to make
connections between your ideas, which can

85
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:34,029
help you to write clearly and efficiently.

86
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:39,899
When you use a semicolon, you don’t need
to use any conjunctions or linking phrases.

87
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:46,479
For example: ‘Companies won’t consider
applications which look rushed; it’s better

88
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,720
to apply to fewer companies, but put more
time into each application.’

89
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:01,860
However, there are some linking words which
can be used with a semicolon, like ‘however’:

90
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:12,500
‘I don’t regret it; however, I would do
things differently if I had another chance.’

91
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:18,150
Like commas, apostrophes have more than one
job, which can make them more difficult to

92
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,069
use correctly.

93
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:26,860
Firstly, use an apostrophe in contractions
to replace a missing letter.

94
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,830
For example: ‘She doesn’t eat cheese.’

95
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,169
‘You’re right about that.’

96
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:40,820
You also use an apostrophe to show that something
belongs to a person: ‘Why have you got Dean’s

97
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,040
jacket?’

98
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:49,050
You can even connect multiple nouns together
like this: ‘Her mother’s cousin’s son

99
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,120
won a Nobel Prize.’

100
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,960
What if the word you want to use already ends
with ‘s’?

101
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:04,600
Here’s the rule: if the ‘s’ after the
apostrophe is pronounced, then you should

102
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,120
write it, too: ‘We met at Boris’s barbecue.’

103
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,560
If you don’t pronounce an extra ‘s’,
then don’t write one; just add an apostrophe

104
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,330
to the end of the word, like this: ‘We could
stay at my parents’ house for a couple of

105
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,640
days.’

106
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,240
Finally, you don’t generally use an apostrophe
to write plurals.

107
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,630
Even if you’re making a proper name plural,
like: ‘There were four Ambers in my group’,

108
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,920
you don’t use an apostrophe for the plural.

109
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,820
However, there’s one exception to this.

110
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,800
Do you know it?

111
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,540
If you need to make a letter plural, then
you add an apostrophe, like this: ‘How many

112
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:58,700
m’s are there in ‘accommodation’?’

113
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:06,340
Hyphens are used to make compound words, especially
compound adjectives.

114
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,550
Compound words are words made of two or more
other words.

115
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,879
For example: ‘It’s a six-hour flight to
Mumbai.’

116
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:21,399
The adjective ‘six-hour’ is made from
the two words ‘six’ and ‘hour’, and

117
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,540
you use a hyphen to connect the two parts.

118
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:32,780
Here’s another example: ‘It was surprisingly
tasty for a five-dollar meal.’

119
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:38,940
However, hyphen use in compound words is inconsistent
and changing.

120
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:45,370
Generally, the trend is to use fewer hyphens,
but there are some cases where you need to

121
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,350
use a hyphen every time.

122
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,850
Compound words made with numbers almost always
have hyphens.

123
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,259
For example: ‘They have a three-year-old
daughter.’

124
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:05,410
The adjective ‘three-year-old’ is made
with a number, and it’s always written with

125
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,019
hyphens.

126
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:12,700
You also need to use hyphens when you use
certain prefixes, like ‘ex-’ or ‘self-’.

127
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,089
Words with the prefix ‘non-’ are also
often hyphenated.

128
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:24,730
For example: ‘His ex-wife was promoted and
is now his direct manager.’

129
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:30,910
‘Non-smokers generally need to pay much
less for health insurance.’

130
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:38,589
‘Self-driving cars may become popular one
day, but for now the technology is too underdeveloped.’

131
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:48,160
If you add a prefix to a proper noun or a
number, you also need a hyphen, as in: ‘anti-European’

132
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,220
‘post-1950 politics’
Finally, you also need to use a hyphen in

133
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,980
compound numbers and fractions.

134
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,980
For example:
‘three-quarters of the population’

135
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,700
‘twenty-three’
‘twenty-three’

136
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:15,220
If you're not sure whether to use a hyphen in a number or not, just write the number.

137
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,240
Dashes might look like hyphens, but they aren’t
the same.

138
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:26,569
First, there are two kinds of dashes, called
en dashes and em dashes.

139
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:32,910
En dashes have a space on either side of the
dash – like this.

140
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:39,709
Em dashes join onto the words before and after—like
this.

141
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:47,500
You don’t need to worry about this; both
en dashes and em dashes do the same job.

142
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,010
Choose one and stick with it.

143
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:54,680
So, what do you use dashes for?

144
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,980
Dashes are used to add extra information to
a sentence.

145
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,160
Remember that commas can also do this.

146
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,899
‘Extra’ information means that you could
remove the information from the sentence and

147
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:12,600
everything would still make sense.

148
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:19,100
Dashes are preferable when the extra information
doesn’t fit well with the grammar or flow

149
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,189
of the sentence.

150
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:27,230
For example: ‘He had escaped—or so he
thought.’

151
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:33,720
Whether something fits the ‘flow’ of your
sentence or not is subjective.

152
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:40,329
That means you can often choose whether to
use dashes or commas to add some extra information

153
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:42,480
to your sentence.

154
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,499
For example: ‘The number of stars in the
Milky Way—including many which are undetectable—is

155
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,280
estimated to be over 400 billion.’

156
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,360
Here, you could replace the dashes with commas.

157
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,100
Both versions are correct.

158
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,620
However, we recommend choosing dashes when
you can.

159
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:09,420
That’s because dashes only do one job, whereas
commas can do multiple jobs.

160
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:15,200
Using dashes makes things clearer, because
your reader doesn’t have to think about

161
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:21,850
why the punctuation is there.

162
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,870
There are two kinds of speech marks: single
and double.

163
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:30,660
Often, they do the same thing, and it doesn’t
matter which you use.

164
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:37,639
However, we recommend that you use double
speech marks when you’re quoting what someone

165
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:38,910
said.

166
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:46,980
For example: He stood up and said “I wouldn’t
do it if you paid me a million dollars.”

167
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:56,759
“Being lucky is more important than being
talented,” were the first words of her speech.

168
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:02,990
Before the speech marks, you can put a comma,
a colon, or nothing.

169
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:10,540
Using a comma is more common, but we recommend
you use nothing, because it’s more efficient.

170
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,399
Whatever you choose, try to be consistent!

171
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:20,329
There are also different opinions about whether
final punctuation—like a full stop at the

172
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:24,769
end of a quote—should go inside or outside
the speech marks.

173
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:33,499
Again, it doesn’t really matter; the most
important thing is to be consistent.

174
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:37,350
Speech marks can be used in other ways, too.

175
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:46,480
Look at two examples: Paying 100 euros for
‘luxury economy’ was not a good idea!

176
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,740
Many cities in the ‘special economic development
zone’ are practically ghost towns.

177
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:58,319
Speech marks can be used to express irony,
sarcasm or scepticism.

178
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:04,559
For example, putting ‘luxury economy’
in speech marks shows that there was nothing

179
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,820
luxurious about the plane journey.

180
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:14,389
In the second example, you put ‘special
economic development zone’ in speech marks

181
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:20,959
to express irony; if many cities are ghost
towns, then there’s clearly not much economic

182
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,959
development there.

183
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:30,750
You also use speech marks when you refer to
words as words.

184
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,899
What does that mean?

185
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:38,910
Look at two examples: ‘Millennium’ is
a difficult word to spell!

186
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,560
Why did you use ‘plethora’ here?’

187
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:49,790
Here, the words ‘millennium’ and ‘plethora’
are used indirectly, to refer to the words

188
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,910
themselves, rather than the ideas.

189
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:59,300
Generally, we recommend using double speech
marks to quote what someone said, and single

190
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,430
speech marks for everything else.

191
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:09,300
However, you may see different styles.

192
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:15,890
Like commas and dashes, parentheses can be
used to add some extra, non-essential information

193
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,270
to your sentence.

194
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:23,500
Often, the information in parentheses is a
date, a name or a statistic.

195
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:32,100
For example: ‘Vladimir Mayakovsky (1893-1930)
was one of the most famous poets of the revolution

196
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,780
era.’

197
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:41,520
‘The percentage of under-30s doing regular
exercise was lower (45%) than that of people

198
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,780
over 45 (52%).’

199
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:52,800
Using parentheses to add statistics and figures
is an efficient method to add numbers and

200
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,800
other supporting data to your writing.

201
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,890
You can also use parentheses to show that
your reader can choose how to understand what

202
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,790
you’re saying.

203
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,900
For example: ‘Write your suggestion(s) here.’

204
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:16,130
By adding ‘s’ in parentheses, you mean
that you can write one suggestion, or more

205
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,460
than one, as you prefer.

206
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:25,360
Try to avoid using parentheses to add longer
ideas to your sentence.

207
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:32,210
For example: ‘Consumption of processed meat
(which has been linked to many diseases, including

208
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:37,320
colon cancer) is rising in many parts of the
world.’

209
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,940
This is not a good example of using parentheses.

210
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:48,450
It would be better to add the additional information
using commas or dashes instead.

211
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:55,630
In this case, commas would be best.

212
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:01,720
Question marks are simple to use; add them
at the end of a direct question, like this:

213
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,050
‘What time is it?’

214
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,970
‘How old are you?’

215
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:13,270
Direct questions can be longer, with more
complex structure: ‘Could you tell me how

216
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,690
to get to the train station?’

217
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:22,560
However, if you’re reporting what someone
else said, then it’s not a question, and

218
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:29,720
you shouldn’t use a question mark: ‘She
asked me how to get to the train station.’

219
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,410
Exclamation marks add some emphasis or emotion
to a sentence.

220
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:38,250
For example: ‘It’s so cold in here!’

221
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,670
‘There’s a snake!’

222
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:47,610
Unless you’re writing something very informal,
it’s generally good style to use exclamation

223
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,870
marks minimally.

224
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,640
Overusing them will make them meaningless.

225
00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:00,180
Like most final punctuation, you shouldn’t
put a space before a question mark or an exclamation

226
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,860
mark, but you do need a space afterwards.

227
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:11,460
OK, we have a question for you: which English
punctuation do you find the most confusing?
