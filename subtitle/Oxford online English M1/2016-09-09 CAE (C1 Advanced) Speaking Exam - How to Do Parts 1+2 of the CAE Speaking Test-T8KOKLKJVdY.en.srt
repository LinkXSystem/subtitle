1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,110
Hello, I’m Jack.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,880
welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:13,010
In this lesson, you can learn how to improve
your score in parts 1 and 2 of the CAE speaking

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,700
exam.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,610
In parts one and two, there are some specific
things that you can do that will help you

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,920
to perform well.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,630
As you may know, Part 1 involves a 2-minute
conversation, during which candidates take

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,360
turns answering questions.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:35,190
The examiner will ask you to speak about everyday
topics and the questions will be quite simple.

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,949
The first tip, is to always develop Your answer.

11
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:44,230
You don’t have a lot of time, so it’s
important to use your time to demonstrate

12
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,390
your English skills.

13
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,510
How should you do this?

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,769
Give long, full answers—simple “yes”
or “no” answers are certainly not enough.

15
00:00:54,769 --> 00:01:01,679
Instead, add reasons, details and examples
to everything that you say.

16
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,870
Now, let’s look at an example of this with
a sample question.

17
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:15,420
Imagine that you are asked this question:
"What keeps you motivated to learn English?"

18
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,710
What would you say?

19
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,580
Here’s a sample answer:
"I enjoy learning English because I can speak

20
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,250
with my foreign friends."

21
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,280
Now this answer is fine, but it could be better
if we

22
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,310
add more reasons, examples and details.

23
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,480
Take a look at this:
"I enjoy learning English because I can speak

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,380
with my foreign friends.

25
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:46,310
For example, one of my acquaintances here
is Polish, and English is a mutual language

26
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,180
we can both understand.

27
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,890
I also work in a multinational company and
I need to speak English a lot."

28
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,700
You can see that the speaker has developed
the point by adding a personal story.

29
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,950
This also allows you to use some more impressive
vocabulary, such as 'acquaintances' and 'multinational'.

30
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:12,590
Of course it’s important not to just keep
speaking and speaking—your answer needs

31
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,000
to have a clear end!

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,690
But, in the exam you will be given some time,
so develop your ideas and make sure you take

33
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,319
advantage of your speaking time by saying
as much as you can.

34
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,170
Tip number two: learn key words related to
everyday topics.

35
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:35,510
In part 1, the questions are about very general
topics, just like when you first meet someone.

36
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,910
This can make it easier to prepare for part
one, and here's how.

37
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,520
It means it’s possible for us to make some
predictions about what you will be asked.

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,820
Common Part 1 topics include:
Where you live;

39
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,910
leisure time;
work;

40
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,740
study;
future plans;

41
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,160
and holiday experiences.

42
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,990
It’s probably not a good idea to prepare
complete phrases, because the examiners are

43
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,990
trained to look for this.

44
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:09,069
But it is however useful to learn a few advanced
level keywords around each topic.

45
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:13,310
This way, you will have a rich vocabulary
prepared that you can use naturally.

46
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,540
Let’s look at an example, using the topic
leisure time.

47
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,870
Imagine you were asked the question:
"What do you do at the weekend?"

48
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,760
What would you say?

49
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,980
If you were interested in surfing, your answer
might be something like this:

50
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,470
"I usually go surfing."

51
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,330
This answer is okay, but it doesn’t really
demonstrate a lot of advanced English.

52
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,050
Now before the exam, if you do a bit of research,
you might then be able to say that you are

53
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,270
quite
'fanatical' about surfing, or that it’s

54
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,550
something that 'helps you to unwind', or even
as an activity in which you can 'get out and

55
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,230
about'.

56
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,570
Perhaps you’re afraid of 'shark attacks'!

57
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,190
With a bit of preparation, you’ll be in
a better place to give a stronger answer:

58
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:05,670
"I usually go surfing—this is something
I’m really fanatical about!

59
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,570
It lets me exercise, unwind, and get out and
about.

60
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,989
I prefer to surf in isolated locations, though
I am a little afraid of shark attacks these

61
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:16,180
days!"

62
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:23,400
Aim to learn five or six new words for each
of the most common topic areas in part 1.

63
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,320
You won’t use all of them, but you might
use one or two.

64
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,570
Even using one or two high-level words and
phrases can make a difference to your vocabulary

65
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,460
score.

66
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,500
Now we’ll look at part 2 of the CAE speaking
exam.

67
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,470
What happens in this part?

68
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,500
The goal in this section is to compare two
pictures and to speculate about the people

69
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,810
in them.

70
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,300
You have a minute to answer and you speak
only to the examiner.

71
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,330
So what are the examiners looking for here?

72
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,530
The examiners want to see that you can put
your thoughts into a well-organized one-minute

73
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,750
answer.

74
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:08,870
So, my first tip for part 2 is: learn how
to compare and speculate.

75
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:14,370
This is a key part of this task, and you can
and should prepare for it.

76
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,440
One aspect of this, is using linking words
to connect your ideas and sentences.

77
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,820
Let’s look at how we can do this, using
these pictures of people reading as an example.

78
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,840
The question might be:
"Compare why these people are reading and

79
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,479
say how they might be feeling."

80
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,550
Let’s look at comparing first.

81
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,699
For things that are similar, use language
like:

82
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,820
'both…';
'each…';

83
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,020
'similarly…';
or 'likewise…';

84
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,770
or even:
'in the same way…';

85
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,610
'we can also see that…'

86
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,780
For example:

87
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,860
"This man may be reading for pleasure and…
…we can also see that she appears to be

88
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,650
enjoying herself."

89
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,740
…similarly, she appears to be enjoying herself."

90
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,750
…in the same way, she appears to be enjoying
herself."

91
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,840
Now for things that are different, use:
'meanwhile…';

92
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,750
'whereas…';
or even:

93
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,210
'by contrast…';
'on the other hand…'

94
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,370
For example:

95
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,650
"The man is reading alone…

96
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,290
...By contrast, this woman seems to be reading
to some children."

97
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:32,460
...On the other hand, the woman seems to be
reading to some children."

98
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,530
...Meanwhile, the woman seems to be reading
to some children."

99
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:43,190
Now in addition to comparing and contrasting,
you need to know how to speculate.

100
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:49,050
You shouldn’t just say what you see; you
also need to talk about the ideas and possibilities

101
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,890
that the picture represents.

102
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,240
Some useful structures include:
'might…';

103
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,750
'perhaps…';
'maybe…';

104
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,949
'it seems like…';

105
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:05,889
For example:
"It seems like he’s reading something very

106
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:07,970
serious and important...

107
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:13,460
...Perhaps she’s reading the children a
fairy story."

108
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,430
You can also use if-sentences to speculate
about what you would do or how you would feel

109
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,650
if you were in the situation:

110
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,740
"If I were her, I’d be very happy!"

111
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:29,660
"If that were me, I’d fall asleep!"

112
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,740
So it’s essential that you study this kind
of language and use it when you practise.

113
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,500
My next tip for part 2 of the CAE speaking
exam is don’t waste time.

114
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,360
Firstly, choose your pictures as soon as you
can.

115
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,630
The best way to do this is to choose two pictures
that seem very different.

116
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:56,020
You should also begin comparing immediately—don’t
waste time telling the examiner which pictures

117
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,590
you want to talk about.

118
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:02,680
Next, don’t paraphrase or repeat the question.

119
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,870
This is one certain way to waste time.

120
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,569
Finally, speak for the whole minute.

121
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:12,720
This leads to our next point.

122
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,610
Have a plan in case you don’t know what
to say.

123
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:22,039
Some students find it helpful to develop a
few automatic back-up ideas for comparison

124
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:24,289
in case they run out of things to talk about.

125
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,520
These are simple ideas that you can use for
any picture.

126
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,009
This way, if you get stuck and can’t think
of anything else to say, you can use these

127
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:35,460
so that you don’t just stop talking.

128
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:42,680
These ideas might be about what the people
are wearing, or how old they are, or even

129
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,060
how many people there are.

130
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,550
"The people in this picture are all wearing
the same clothes.

131
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,160
Likewise, these people seem to be all dressed
in white."

132
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:03,850
Better still, ask yourself what the people
may be thinking, feeling, or doing.

133
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:10,570
These kinds of comparisons are always useful,
as they allow for a lot of speculation.

134
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:17,820
"This image shows people singing, whereas
these people appear to be doing some kind

135
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,450
of martial art."

136
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:26,740
The main point is that you have some questions
you can ask yourself in any situation.

137
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,170
What ideas can you think of?

138
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,320
Tip number six: don’t spend all the time
describing.

139
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,640
This is probably the most important tip, because
it’s the biggest mistake that candidates

140
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,570
make.

141
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,310
You don’t need to say what you see, and
you don’t need to describe the pictures

142
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,779
at all.

143
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:51,940
Your job is to make comparisons and speculate
about the pictures, not to say what the pictures

144
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,090
show.

145
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:59,020
If you spend too much time describing, you’re
not giving yourself the opportunity to demonstrate

146
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,440
your abilities to compare and speculate in
a longer answer.

147
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:10,269
OK, so how can you practise and prepare for
part two of the CAE speaking test?

148
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:15,140
The best thing that you can do is to practise
with as many different images as possible.

149
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,760
It’s always better doing this with a friend
or a teacher, but you can also do this alone

150
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,730
with a timer.

151
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:27,420
You can even make your own combinations of
sample images, simply by doing a Google search

152
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,580
and picking two random images.

153
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:37,380
You could search for “people on holiday”,
or “people eating”, or “groups of people”.

154
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,770
Then imagine a question, remembering that
the typical question format contains two parts:

155
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,100
1.

156
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,540
Compare the two situations, and:
2.

157
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,019
Speculate on how the people may be feeling,
or the reasons for their behaviour.

158
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:59,589
So we might get something like this:
"Compare how these people are enjoying their

159
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:02,230
holidays, and say how they might be feeling."

160
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:08,440
Now, I'm going to give you an example answer,
and I want you to try and think how I could

161
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,779
improve this.

162
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:18,450
"These people are enjoying their holidays
with their family.

163
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,180
They are sitting outside with their dogs.

164
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,959
There are two adults and they are happy.

165
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,649
These people are about to get on a plane.

166
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:31,839
They are in a desert…"

167
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,660
Now, let’s stop right there!

168
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,910
What is wrong with this answer and how could
it be improved?

169
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,760
Can you tell me?

170
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,480
Firstly, I’m simply describing the pictures.

171
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,890
But we talked about how important it is to
compare and contrast.

172
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:55,120
Secondly, I’m not using any language or
linking words to do this.

173
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,300
What else am I doing wrong?

174
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:04,240
I’m not speculating – again, I’m simply
describing what I’m looking at.

175
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,440
In addition, I'm going way too slow!

176
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,649
Let’s try again.

177
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:13,980
"This image seems to show a family spending
the holiday together.

178
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,050
In the same way, this might be a couple.

179
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,670
However it doesn’t look like they have their
children with them.

180
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,690
In this picture, the family seems to be at
home, or at a holiday house, whereas in this

181
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:29,490
picture these people appear to be in some
kind of exotic destination, far away from

182
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,490
civilization.

183
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:36,860
There are animals in this photo, whereas there
are only people in this one.

184
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,670
Both scenes show people having a holiday outdoors.

185
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,640
I suppose the key difference is that the people
in this image appear to be having a real adventure,

186
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,779
and are free, whereas the people here are
spending time with family.

187
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:52,940
If it were me, I’d prefer to be going on
this kind of holiday – flying around in

188
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,370
a plane in a new and wild place!"

189
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,980
As you can see, I’ve focused on comparing
and contrasting as much as possible, using

190
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,050
a variety of language structures.

191
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,690
I’ve also continued to speculate all the
way through.

192
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,590
I’ve used both simple comparisons, like
whether there are animals in the photo, as

193
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:17,000
well as more complex ones, speculating that
one is a family holiday, whereas the other

194
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,300
is an adventure.

195
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,610
After this, the big challenge is practising
to do all this in the time limits!

196
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,760
That’s the end of the lesson.

197
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,980
Thanks very much for watching!
