1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,150
Hello.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,250
Hi.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,640
What's your name?

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,240
My name's Kasia, and you are?

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,960
My name's Olivier.

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,800
Nice to meet you.

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,800
And you.

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,760
What are we doing in this lesson?

9
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,780
We're going to talk about greetings and introductions
in English.

10
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,780
Hi.

11
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,109
I'm Olivier.

12
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:23,090
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

13
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:29,460
What’s the first word you learned in English?

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,539
Probably 'hello', right?

15
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:36,120
'Hello' is the most basic way to greet someone
in English.

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,900
There are many different ways to greet people
and introduce yourself in English.

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,269
In different situations, you’ll need to
use different words and phrases to greet people

18
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:46,860
or make introductions.

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,840
In this lesson, you can learn about greetings
and introductions in English and see which

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,489
language you should use in different situations.

21
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:02,570
Imagine that you’re on a business trip,
and you’re meeting some important clients

22
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,680
for the first time.

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,910
Or maybe you work in service, for example
in a hotel, and you need to talk to guests

24
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,270
and customers.

25
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,460
In these situations, you’ll want to use
more formal language.

26
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,460
Good morning!

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,280
You must be Olivier.

28
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,600
Yes, good morning!

29
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,520
I’m sorry, and your name is…?

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,000
My name’s Kasia.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,570
Very nice to meet you.

32
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,170
Welcome to Madrid!

33
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,830
Thank you.

34
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,880
How are you today?

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,520
Very well, thank you, and yourself?

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,180
I’m good, thanks for asking.

37
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,860
This dialogue uses more formal language.

38
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,990
Can you see what makes it formal?

39
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,180
First, I started by saying good morning.

40
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,310
The greetings good morning, good afternoon
and good evening are quite formal and are

41
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,080
generally only used in formal situations.

42
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,700
There’s one exception: you can sometimes
use good morning informally with people you

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,700
know.

44
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:12,140
However, it’s common in this situation to
simply say 'morning'.

45
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,360
Can you see any other examples of formal language
in this dialogue?

46
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,440
There are many.

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,310
Firstly, I asked Kasia’s name by saying,
and your name is…?

48
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,450
This is more formal than asking what’s your
name?

49
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,500
After she introduced herself, Kasia said very
nice to meet you.

50
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,500
Saying nice to meet you is neutral—neither
formal nor informal.

51
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,700
However, adding very makes it sound much more
formal.

52
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,900
One word can make a big difference!

53
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,210
I introduced myself with a full sentence:
My name’s Kasia.

54
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,570
When speaking less formally, you’d use a
shorter introduction, like I’m Kasia or

55
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,570
just Kasia.

56
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,630
After I introduced myself, I said Welcome
to Madrid.

57
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,710
Does this sound formal or informal to you?

58
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,460
It’s quite formal.

59
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,630
Do you know why it's formal?

60
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,709
Again, it’s a small change which makes a
big difference.

61
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,310
Saying welcome by itself is neutral—it’s
not formal.

62
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,020
However, adding to and a place makes it sound
much more formal.

63
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:24,090
So, if you say, Welcome to our office! that
sounds formal, while if you just say, Welcome!

64
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,460
it doesn’t sound so formal.

65
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:33,040
It’s common when greeting someone in English
to ask some kind of how are you question.

66
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,310
Do you remember what Kasia asked me?

67
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,790
She asked How are you today?

68
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:47,110
Again, one word makes the difference—do
you know which one?

69
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,319
It’s today.

70
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,480
Asking how are you is neutral.

71
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,700
Adding today makes it sound more formal.

72
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,980
My answer, Very well, thank you, also sounds
quite formal.

73
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:09,480
If I was speaking more neutrally, I’d say
something like, Well, thanks.

74
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:16,100
Adding very and saying thank you instead of
thanks makes it sound more formal.

75
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,259
Finally, Olivier asked me how are you back.

76
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:24,460
Do you remember how he did it?

77
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,220
He asked, and yourself?

78
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,360
This is more formal than asking and you?

79
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,189
I replied and said thanks for asking.

80
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:39,300
You wouldn’t say thanks for asking in a
more informal situation.

81
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:47,849
So, you’ve seen here how small changes can
make a big difference to how formal your language

82
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:49,210
sounds.

83
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:55,419
Remember that formality doesn’t just depend
on the words you use; other things like tone

84
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:59,319
of voice and body language are also important.

85
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:09,840
Next, let’s look at how to handle greetings
and introductions in a neutral way.

86
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,180
‘Neutral’ means neither formal nor informal.

87
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,620
For example, imagine you’re at work, and
you meet a new colleague.

88
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,680
You’re the same age and you’re in the
same department.

89
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,800
This is an example of a neutral situation.

90
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:37,420
You don’t need to be very formal, but you
also wouldn’t want to sound too casual.

91
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,340
Hello!

92
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,420
Hello!

93
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,530
Are you Olivier?

94
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,639
Yes, that’s right.

95
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,470
What’s your name?

96
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,490
Kasia.

97
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,990
Nice to meet you.

98
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,990
And you.

99
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,029
How are you?

100
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:51,710
Fine, thanks, and you?

101
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,180
I’m good, thanks.

102
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,729
First, compare this dialogue to the formal
one from part one.

103
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:03,509
They follow the same pattern, but this dialogue
is much less formal.

104
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:05,630
Can you see the differences?

105
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,499
First, we started with a neutral greeting,
hello.

106
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:13,349
You can use hello in any situation.

107
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:19,240
Then, I asked Olivier his name with a simple
question, What’s your name?

108
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,009
Hello, what’s your name… pretty easy,
right?

109
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:29,050
That’s because neutral language is generally
the simplest language.

110
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,339
If you compare the two dialogues, you can
see that this neutral dialogue is shorter

111
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:39,069
than the formal dialogue you saw in part one.

112
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:46,090
This is very common: formal language is often
longer and more complex.

113
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,150
Neutral language is short and simple.

114
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:56,770
You can see this throughout the dialogue:
we use the basic words and phrases that you

115
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:04,690
probably learned in lesson one of your English
classes at school: nice to meet you; how are

116
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:09,409
you; fine, thanks; and so on.

117
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:15,460
Okay, so now you’ve learned about the differences
between formal and neutral greetings and introductions.

118
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,240
What about informal greetings and introductions?

119
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,960
Informal greetings and introductions are useful
if you know someone well, or if you’re meeting

120
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,749
someone in a casual situation.

121
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:38,729
For example, if you’re hanging out with
some friends, and your friends introduce you

122
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:43,740
to one of their friends, you would probably
use informal language.

123
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,199
Let’s see how this works:

124
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,349
Hi!

125
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:48,499
Hey!

126
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:49,649
Olivier?

127
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:50,809
Yeah.

128
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:51,809
Your name?

129
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:52,809
Kasia.

130
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:54,219
Good to meet you.

131
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:55,330
You too.

132
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,899
How you doing?

133
00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:59,139
Yeah, not bad.

134
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:00,139
You?

135
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:01,539
Pretty good!

136
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:08,120
So, what do you notice here?

137
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,669
The first thing you can see is that the dialogue
is even shorter than the neutral dialogue

138
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:16,129
you saw in part two.

139
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:20,279
We both used a lot of short questions and
sentences.

140
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,080
For example:

141
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,889
Olivier?

142
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:26,080
Your name?

143
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,620
How you doing?

144
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,889
You?

145
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:37,159
These are fine in informal speech, and native
speakers often shorten sentences and questions

146
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,889
like this.

147
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:45,630
However, you wouldn’t do this in a more
formal situation.

148
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:51,740
There are also several phrases which you wouldn’t
use in a more formal setting, such as:

149
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,730
Hi/Hey
Yeah

150
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,860
Not bad
Pretty good

151
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:02,270
These are all good words and phrases to use
in an informal situation.

152
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,740
At this point, you could go back and review
the three dialogues.

153
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:12,300
Each dialogue has exactly the same structure—only
the language is different.

154
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,240
See how you can use different words and phrases
to greet people and introduce yourself with

155
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,190
different levels of formality.

156
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,190
Okay?

157
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,860
Let’s look at one more thing.

158
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:31,800
When you’re making introductions, you might
also need to introduce another person.

159
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,019
Let’s see how you can do that in formal,
neutral, or informal ways.

160
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:43,000
Here’s a very formal introduction.

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,520
Let me introduce my colleague, Kasia.

162
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,410
Here’s another very formal way to introduce
someone:

163
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,310
May I introduce my colleague, Olivier?

164
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,389
What about neutral introductions?

165
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:01,339
This is Kasia.

166
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:08,269
Here’s another way to make in introduction
using neutral language.

167
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:11,490
Have you met Olivier?

168
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,730
Finally, what about informal introductions?

169
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,720
In informal situations, you might not introduce
people at all.

170
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,120
You might just let them introduce themselves,
or you might prompt them to introduce themselves

171
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,220
by asking something like:

172
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,370
Have you guys met?

173
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,449
Do you two know each other?

174
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:40,029
If you want to make an informal introduction,
the most common way is just to say the two

175
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:43,730
people’s names, then say them again in reverse.

176
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:49,930
For example, imagine you’re introducing
two people called John and Emma to each other.

177
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,149
You could say:

178
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:54,350
John, Emma.

179
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,560
Emma, John.

180
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,290
So now, you should understand how to greet
people and introduce yourself or someone else

181
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,110
in different situations.

182
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,670
