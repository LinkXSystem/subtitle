00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,340
Hi I'm Oli.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,770

button in the bottom right of the video player.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,579
‘Tell me about yourself.’

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,720
This question makes people nervous.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,800
What can you say?

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,960
Honestly, this is a bad question to ask.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,059
If I was giving someone a job interview, I
would never ask this question, because it

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,500
makes people uncomfortable.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,220
But, you might hear it, and need to answer!

17
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,520
Maybe in a job interview, or an interview
for university, or in an English exam, or

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,470
somewhere else.

19
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,880
In this lesson, you’ll see answers to this
question for four different situations.

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,240
One: in a job interview.

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,759
Two: in a university interview.

22
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,640
Three: in an English exam.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,830
This is the most general example, so if you
just want a general way to respond to ‘tell

24
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,409
me about yourself’, watch this section.

25
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,869
Four: when introducing yourself to new colleagues.

26
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,520
Before we look at our sample answers, let’s
see four general tips.

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,750
First, think about the context you’re in.

28
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:56,610
‘Tell me about yourself’ doesn’t mean
‘Tell me *everything* about yourself.’

29
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,680
You need to choose where to focus.

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,259
For example, in a job interview, you should
focus on your professional background.

31
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:09,220
In an English exam, you’ll probably give
a more general answer.

32
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,920
Secondly, keep your answer short and focused.

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,980
Our sample answers are mostly around three
or four sentences.

34
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,480
This is a good length to aim for.

35
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,400
Thirdly, remember that this question will
usually be asked at the beginning of an interview.

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,319
In most cases, the interviewer won’t pay
much attention to the content of what you

37
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,209
say, so don’t worry about it too much.

38
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:38,800
The most important thing is that you can answer
confidently and coherently.

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,180
Finally, here’s a suggestion for a general
structure: make one or two sentences about

40
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,129
your past, one or two sentences about your
current situation, and one or two sentences

41
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:52,020
about the future.

42
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,580
Now, let’s see some examples!

43
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,530
I’m currently working in HR for Dell, but
actually as you’ve probably seen from my

44
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,970
CV, my background is in graphic design.

45
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,100
I’ve been wanting to get back to graphic
design work for some time, and that’s why

46
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,459
I applied for this position.

47
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:17,240
In this answer, you talk about your current
situation, and then add details about your

48
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,900
background.

49
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,550
It’s a simple answer, but that’s fine.

50
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:27,379
It’s focused and clear, and it gives your
interviewer the chance to ask for more details

51
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,049
if he or she wants.

52
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:31,299
Let’s see one more example:

53
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:35,799
I’ve been working in biomedical research
for about five years.

54
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:42,430
I completed my PhD four years ago, and I worked
for a small pharmaceutical company here, until,

55
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,230
unfortunately, they went out of business recently.

56
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:51,569
So, I’m currently looking for a new position
in biotech, pharma, or anything related to

57
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:55,120
my training and experience.

58
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,530
This answer is a little more detailed.

59
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,819
It also doesn’t really include information
about the future.

60
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:06,260
That’s OK – the past-present-future idea
isn’t a template which you *have* to follow;

61
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,640
it’s just a way to organise your ideas.

62
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,780
Let’s look at some language from these examples.

63
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,910
In sentences three and four, after ‘in’,
you need to name a sector.

64
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,970
For example, ‘I’ve been working in the
education sector for seven years.’

65
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,080
If you want to name a company, use ‘at’.

66
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,660
For example, ‘I’ve been working *at* HSBC
for a year and a half.’

67
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,660
Could you complete these sentences to make
them true for you?

68
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,360
Pause the video and try it now!

69
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,040
Say your sentences out loud.

70
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,180
Next, let’s look at university interviews.

71
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,860
I’ve always loved drama, watching plays,
and everything else connected with the theatre.

72
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,800
I’ve been involved in our school drama society
for several years, both in terms of acting

73
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,640
in productions and also working behind the
scenes, with set design, lighting, and things

74
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
like that.

75
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,240
I’ve known for a long time that I want to
be an actor, and studying drama here would

76
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,210
be a logical next step towards that goal,
I think.

77
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:27,389
This answer gives more details about the speaker’s
past experience, and less information about

78
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:29,920
the present and future.

79
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,980
As you heard before, this is no problem!

80
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:39,160
Don’t feel that you need to have a certain
number of sentences about the past, or whatever.

81
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,760
Different answers will fit different situations.

82
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,940
Be flexible!

83
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,660
Let’s see one more sample answer.

84
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,620
I always knew I wanted to be a scientist,
even when I was little.

85
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,360
My best subjects throughout school have been
maths and science, but at this point I’d

86
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,880
like to specialise more, which is why I’m
applying to study astrophysics.

87
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,970
I’m doing my IB next month, and my predicted
grade is 40 or higher.

88
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,740
I’m hoping you’ll offer me a place to
study here, and I’m excited to start my

89
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,240
studies in September.

90
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,720
These answers are specialised; they focus
on particular subjects.

91
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,140
But, there are several pieces of language
you can use, whatever you study.

92
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,800
Let’s look.

93
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,940
Of course, you can change these phrases to
fit your situation.

94
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,639
For example, if you’re still at school,
you’ll probably say ‘are’ or ‘have

95
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,360
been’ in number two, instead of ‘were’.

96
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,660
Now, it’s your turn to practise!

97
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,139
Use these four phrases to make your own answer,
using your own ideas.

98
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:47,580
Pause the video, and say your answer out loud
now.

99
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,850
How was that?

100
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,300
You might need to practise a few times to
get everything fluent.

101
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,340
Take your time and practise as many times
as you need.

102
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,230
Next, let’s see how to answer ‘tell me
about yourself’ in a more general way, for

103
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:08,720
example in an English exam.

104
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,660
Honestly, in most English exams, you’re
not likely to be asked this question.

105
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,120
In common international exams, like IELTS
or the Cambridge exams, questions are more

106
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,300
focused.

107
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,669
But, it’s possible.

108
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:25,440
Or, you might need to answer the question
‘tell me about yourself’ in a different

109
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
situation.

110
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,340
Let’s look at a more general answer to this
question:

111
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,260
Well, I was born in Vladivostok, but my dad
moved around a lot for his work, so I grew

112
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,930
up in different places: Japan, The Philippines
and Malaysia.

113
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,729
Currently I’m working part-time and studying
for a Master’s in film production.

114
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:49,210
I’m pretty interested in film, video production
and things like that, so I’m hoping to work

115
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,240
in that sector once I finish my studies.

116
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,660
You can see that the answer is more general
and personal, rather than focusing on work

117
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,480
or studies.

118
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,520
Let’s see one more:

119
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,380
I’m originally from Buenos Aires, but I’ve
been living here in Dublin for several years

120
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,440
now.

121
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:14,240
I work for an ad agency, as a copywriter,
which is something I never imagined I would

122
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,639
do, but I really like it.

123
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,030
I was never good at English when I was younger,
so it’s weird that I ended up working in

124
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,460
a job which requires very high-level language
skills.

125
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,210
I like living here, but I feel like I’d
also like to travel and experience living

126
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:39,110
in other places, so I’m thinking about moving
to Canada or the US in the next year or so.

127
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:45,080
This is the longest of our sample answers,
but it’s still quite short: about 100 words.

128
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,940
Remember that you don’t want your answer
to be too long.

129
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,280
Keep it short and focused!

130
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,860
If you’re asked the question ‘tell me
about yourself’ in an English exam or general

131
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,990
situation, let’s see some language you can
use to build an answer.

132
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:08,920
In number two, you put a company after ‘for’,
and your position after ‘as’.

133
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,160
For example, ‘I’m working for Google as
a tester.’

134
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,990
In number four, you put an -ing verb after
‘about’, to describe something which you

135
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,120
are considering doing in the future.

136
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,480
For example, ‘I’m thinking about changing
jobs.’

137
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,120
Let’s try together.

138
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,980
Make your own answer, using these four phrases.

139
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,010
If you want, add more sentences or details
to your answer.

140
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:43,070
Pause the video, and make your answer now.

141
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,200
How was that?

142
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,080
Easy?

143
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,500
Difficult?

144
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:52,290
If it’s difficult, read the sample answers
– you can find the text on our website.

145
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:57,200
Use the sample answers as a model, and change
the details so that you’re using your own

146
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,860
information.

147
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,920
Let’s move on to our last section.

148
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,700
Sometimes, if you start working in a new company,
you’ll have to introduce yourself at a meeting.

149
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:16,540
Here, your answer should focus on your professional
background, like in a job interview.

150
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,320
However, you’ll probably use a more conversational
tone.

151
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,670
Let’s see our first sample.

152
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:29,570
My name’s Gwen, and as you maybe know I
just started here; this is my first week,

153
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,570
in fact.

154
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,880
I’m working in the marketing department
as a web marketing coordinator.

155
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,630
My background is a mix of marketing and software
– I started my career as a software engineer.

156
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:46,350
I’m still finding my feet and I haven’t
met all of you yet, but I’m looking forward

157
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,320
to working with you all.

158
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,520
If you’re walking past my office, come and
say ‘hi’!

159
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:57,649
If you work in a larger company, you might
need to introduce yourself to colleagues even

160
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:01,730
if you’ve worked there for some time, for
example, if you’re starting a project with

161
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,060
people you’ve never worked with before.

162
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,480
Let’s see how that could look:

163
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,920
Hi, I’m Elias.

164
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,360
I’m the CISO, so I’m responsible for online
security, and keeping our computers and networks

165
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,370
safe.

166
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,220
You’ve probably seen me around, because
I’ve been working here for a while – almost

167
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,130
ten years now!

168
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:25,029
As you just heard, all staff need to take
our cybersecurity training class, so you’ll

169
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:29,590
be learning about how to stay safe online
with me or one of my colleagues in the next

170
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,990
month or two.

171
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:38,029
Here’s your final challenge: imagine you’ve
started a new job, and you have to introduce

172
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,900
yourself to your colleagues in a meeting.

173
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,020
Make an answer to introduce yourself.

174
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:47,340
You can use all the language you’ve seen
in this lesson.

175
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,579
Try to make your answer three or four sentences
long.

176
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,540
Say your answer out loud.

177
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,040
Could you do it?

178
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,420
If so, great!

179
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,620
If not, keep practising!

180
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,920
You can also review the lesson and the sample
answers to get ideas.

181
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,610
Now, we hope that hearing the question ‘tell
me about yourself’ won’t make you feel

182
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,970
so nervous!

183
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,100
So, tell me about yourself.

184
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,020
Practise your answers and put them in the
comments, and share them with other students.

185
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,780
Thanks for watching!

186
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,580
See you next time!
