00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,880
Hi, I’m Martin. Welcome to Oxford\h
Online English. In this lesson,\h\h

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,880
you can learn how to make and accept suggestions,\h
using the right phrases and vocabulary.\h\h

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,760
You’ll also see how to reject\h
someone else’s suggestion politely.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,800
Making suggestions is useful for\h
your everyday English conversation.\h\h

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,840
In social situations, being able to make, accept\h
and reject suggestions politely is important!

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,920
Let’s start by seeing different ways to\h
make and accept suggestions in English.

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,775
Let’s listen to two friends talking\h
together. 

11
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:02,880
As you\hlisten, think about two questions.

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:14,320
One: what language is used to make suggestions?
Two: what language is used to accept suggestions?\h

13
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,960
Ready? Let’s listen to the dialogue.

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,920
It’s a lovely day. Why don’t we go out somewhere?
Sure. Why not?\h

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,440
How about going for a walk? Maybe along the river?
Sounds great.\h

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,280
Shall we stop somewhere for some lunch?
That’s a good idea.\h

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let’s try that new restaurant by the park.
Great. I’m in!

18
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:45,200
Could you hear all the different ways to make\h
and accept suggestions? Let’s look together.\h

19
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:53,840
One of these phrases has a different structure\h
to the other three. Do you know which one?\h

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,960
‘How about’ is different, because\h
you use it with a verb plus -ing.\h\h

21
00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:10,760
The other three are all followed by infinitive verbs, without 'to'.

22
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,684
Let's practise.

23
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:16,779
Complete these suggestions with your own ideas.

24
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:19,504
Pay attention to the verb form.

25
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:23,760
What suggestions did you make? Of\h\h

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,000
course, there are many possible\h
answers! Here are some examples.

27
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:38,240
It’s a beautiful day. Let’s go to the beach.
I’m hungry. How about going out for a pizza?\h

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,400
I’m free this morning. Why\h
don’t we go to the market?\h

29
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,794
There’s a movie on channel 4. Shall we watch it?

30
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,640
Were your suggestions the same as mine?

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,840
Now, let’s see phases you can use to\h
accept a suggestion. In the dialogue, you heard:

32
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,720
There are many other phrases you could use.\h\h

33
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,560
You could just say something simple\h
like ‘yeah’ or ‘yeah, why not?’\h

34
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,600
If you want to sound a little less\h
casual, you could say something like\h\h

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,960
‘I would like that’ or ‘That\h
sounds like a good idea.’\h

36
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,040
But, what if you don’t want to do what the\h
other person is suggesting? Let’s look.

37
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,000
Sometimes, even though it’s a bit difficult,\h
you’ve got to reject a suggestion have to\h\h

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,200
say ‘no’ to people.

39
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,640
In this case, it’s important to be\h
polite, even if you’re talking to a friend.

40
00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:00,880
Let’s see a dialogue which shows you how *not*\h
to do this. Listen and try to find the problems.

41
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,520
It’s a beautiful day. Shall we go out somewhere?\h

42
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,000
No, I don’t want to.
Oh, come on!\h\h

43
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,800
Why don’t we go for a walk along the river?
What an awful idea.\h

44
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,760
Well, let’s go somewhere for some lunch.
No, let’s not.\h

45
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,040
Well, how about watching a movie together?
Count me out.

46
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:24,960
What do you think?\h

47
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,360
You *could* use phrases like this\h
to reject someone else’s suggestion…\h

48
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,640
but it doesn’t sound polite.

49
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:43,000
So,\h\hhow could we improve them? Listen\h
again and see the difference.

50
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,560
It’s a beautiful day. Shall we go out somewhere?
I’d rather not, if you don’t mind.\h

51
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,160
Oh, come on! Why don’t we go\h
for a walk along the river?\h

52
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,480
I don’t really feel like it, I’m afraid.
Well, let’s go somewhere for some lunch.\h

53
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,274
Maybe another time.

54
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:09,840
Did you hear the four polite phrases\h
you can use to say ‘no’ to a suggestion?\h

55
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,291
Let’s look together.

56
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:18,560
These are polite ways to reject a suggestion.

57
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:25,840
The phrase – ‘can I take a rain check?’\h
– means that you want to do something, but\h\h

58
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,699
not right now. You’ll do it another time.

59
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,840
It’s a lovely day. Why don’t we go shopping?\h

60
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,760
Maybe another time. I’ve got a lot to do today.
How about going for a walk? Maybe along the river?\h

61
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,240
I don’t really feel like it,\h
I’m afraid. I’m a bit tired.\h

62
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,440
Well, let’s go somewhere for lunch.
I’d rather not, if you don’t mind.\h\h

63
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,560
I’m not very hungry right now.
Then how about going to the park?\h

64
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,520
Can I take a rain check? I’m\h
a bit busy at the moment.

65
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:05,544
When you say\h\h

66
00:06:05,544 --> 00:06:10,320
‘no’ to someone’s suggestion, you can\h
sound more polite by adding a reason.\h\h

67
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,680
Can you remember the reasons\h
you heard in the dialogue?\h

68
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,945
You heard these.

69
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:22,080
Now it’s over to you. 

70
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,640
Like we did before, I’m going to make\h
some suggestions. After you hear each suggestion,\h\h

71
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,400
pause the video, reject the suggestion\h
politely, and add a reason. Ready to start?

72
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,880
It’s a lovely day. Let’s go for a picnic.\h

73
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,880
I’m thirsty. How about a cup of tea?
I’m free this afternoon. Why don’t\h\h

74
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,840
we go to the cinema?

75
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,280
There’s a new restaurant in Queen\h
Street. Shall we go there this evening?

76
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,080
How did you do? Here\h\h

77
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,838
are some possible reasons you could use.

78
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:09,729
Were any of your reasons the same as mine?

79
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,240
If not, don’t worry! There are\h
many possible answers here.

80
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:25,600
Now, you should know different ways to make,\h
accept and reject suggestions politely in English.

81
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,320
Are we done? Not yet! There’s\h
one more important point.

82
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:39,040
When you’re accepting a suggestion,

83
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,760
intonation is critical. Even if\h
you use correct, polite language,\h\h

84
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,680
you can still sound unfriendly\h
if your intonation is not right.

85
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,480
Compare two answers.
Shall we go shopping?\h

86
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,880
That’s a good idea.
That’s a good idea!\h

87
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,240
Can you hear it? The same words can\h
have a completely different meaning\h\h

88
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,400
if you change the intonation.

89
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,360
When you’re accepting rejecting a\h
suggestion, try to sound a little apologetic.

90
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,760
Now, I’m going to reject a suggestion\h
twice, using different intonation. Listen;\h\h

91
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,480
which answer has the correct,\h
apologetic intonation?

92
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,760
I can’t, I’m afraid. I’ve got some work to do.\h

93
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:45,120
I can’t, I’m afraid. I’ve got some work to do.
Could you hear? Which one sounded more polite?

94
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:56,000
The first answer had polite intonation. The\h
second one didn’t, and could sound unfriendly.

95
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,200
Now it’s your turn to practise.\h

96
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,240
You’ll\hhear four suggestions. After each one,\h\h

97
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,200
either accept it, or reject it.\h
Focus on using polite intonation.\h\h

98
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,400
This is also a great chance to check if you\h
remember all the language from this lesson! Ready?

99
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:22,240
It’s a lovely day. Let’s go for a picnic.
I’m thirsty. How about a cup of tea?\h

100
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,520
I’m free this afternoon. Why\h
don’t we go to the cinema?\h

101
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,240
There’s a new restaurant in\h
Queen Street. Shall we go there?\h

102
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:44,880
How did you get on? Did you manage to sound\h
enthusiastic or apologetic? It’s not always\h\h

103
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:52,000
easy to judge your own intonation, so you might\h
want to ask someone else if you sound natural.

104
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,680
Although polite intonation is important, you\h
don’t want to overdo it. It will sound weird.

105
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,000
That’s everything. Thanks for watching.

106
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:14,960
See you next time!
