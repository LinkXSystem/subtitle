00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,170
Hi, I’m Mikey.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,470
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,540
In this lesson, you can learn how to write
an IELTS task two essay.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:17,280
Task two in the IELTS writing exam is the
biggest challenge in IELTS for many students.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,800
You have 40 minutes to write an essay, which
could be on almost any topic.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,300
In this lesson, you’ll see a model question
and a possible answer to it.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:35,899
You’ll learn how to write your own IELTS
essay, and we’ll share useful tips to help

8
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,379
you improve your IELTS writing score.

9
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,820
Let’s start with our sample question:

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,620
Some people believe that everyone should be
free to make their own lifestyle choices,

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,230
even if those choices are unhealthy.

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,519
Other people think that the government should
intervene to influence people’s choices,

13
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:57,739
for example by putting high taxes on unhealthy
products.

14
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:00,979
Discuss both of these views and give your
own opinion.

15
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:05,100
Give reasons for your answer and include any
relevant examples from your own knowledge

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,400
or experience.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,080
So, where do you start?

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,500
You’re under time pressure in the IELTS
writing exam.

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,510
This means that many IELTS candidates read
the task quickly and start writing as fast

20
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,690
as possible.

21
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,030
It’s understandable, but it’s also a mistake.

22
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:34,000
To write a good answer, you need to understand
the task well, and you need to have a plan

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,990
for what you’re going to write.

24
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:43,160
It’s easy to misunderstand the question,
or to misunderstand a key word in the question.

25
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,960
This will hurt your score.

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,570
So, you need to analyse the task.

27
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,260
How can you do this?

28
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,140
First, read the question and try to explain
what it’s asking in your own words.

29
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,840
Look at our sample question again.

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,430
Could you rephrase this question in your own
words?

31
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,210
Try to make it as simple as you can.

32
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,880
Think about it.

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,500
Here are some suggestions:

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,409
Should people be allowed to make their own lifestyle
choices, even if they’re very unhealthy?

35
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:21,830
Should the government try to make people live
healthier lives, even if it means that people

36
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,730
lose some personal freedom?

37
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,810
Of course, there are other possibilities.

38
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,319
This is an important step; if you don’t
have any ideas here, it suggests you haven’t

39
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,450
understood the question fully.

40
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,379
That means you need to go back and read it
again, and think about it more.

41
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,200
What’s next?

42
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,469
Secondly, you need to identify how many things
the task is asking you to do.

43
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:51,480
Not all IELTS questions are the same.

44
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,189
Some questions ask you to do one or two things.

45
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:59,340
Other questions ask you to do three or four
things.

46
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,900
What about here?

47
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,819
How many things is this question asking you
to do?

48
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:08,359
You have to ‘discuss both of these views’.

49
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:12,379
That means you need to discuss the idea that
everyone should be free to make their own

50
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:18,519
lifestyle choices, and you also need to discuss
the idea that the government should intervene

51
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,909
to influence people’s choices.

52
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:26,749
You need to give your own opinion, so you
need to reach a conclusion about which viewpoint

53
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:28,709
you agree with.

54
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,549
Finally, you need to give reasons for your
answer and include relevant examples.

55
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:38,650
So, you need to do four things here.

56
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:44,639
When you read the question in your IELTS exam,
add numbers to the task, like this.

57
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,279
This way, you can check when you’re planning
or writing, and make sure you aren’t leaving

58
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:51,579
anything out.

59
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:57,180
Let’s review: when you analyse the task,
you should try to rephrase the question in

60
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,019
your own words, and then work out how many
things you need to do.

61
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,159
What comes next?

62
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:12,969
This is a super-important step, even if you
feel that you don’t have time.

63
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:17,959
If you don’t plan, it’s hard to write
a clear, well-organised essay.

64
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,479
This makes it difficult to get higher scores.

65
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,750
When planning, you need to:

66
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,660
One: decide what your conclusion is going
to be.

67
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,140
Two: decide how many body paragraphs you’re
going to have.

68
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,560
Let’s think about these steps for our sample
question.

69
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,080
There are three basic conclusions you can
reach here.

70
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,180
You could say that people are free to make
whatever unhealthy choices they want, and

71
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,400
the government should not get involved.

72
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,600
You could say that the government should intervene
to influence people’s decisions, and that

73
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,410
people are not free to make absolutely any
bad choices they want.

74
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:05,800
Or, you could go for a balanced conclusion,
where your position is a compromise between

75
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,340
both sides.

76
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,710
What do you think?

77
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,120
If you were writing this essay, what would
your conclusion be?

78
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,800
Remember that one conclusion isn’t better
than another.

79
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,230
You can say whatever you want.

80
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:25,310
However, you should know what your conclusion
is before you go any further.

81
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,780
Otherwise, it’s impossible to make a coherent
plan.

82
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,520
Next, you need to plan your body paragraphs.

83
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:41,960
An important point: each body paragraph should
have one main point, and only one main point.

84
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,389
Don’t put many different ideas in one paragraph.

85
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:52,139
You also need to make sure your body paragraphs
are consistent with your conclusion.

86
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,720
If your conclusion is that people are free
to make unhealthy choices, then you can’t

87
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,910
include a body paragraph talking about the
negative effects of unhealthy lifestyle choices.

88
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,930
Let’s look at three sample plans:

89
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:15,199
Body paragraph 1: people are free to decide
what to do with their own bodies

90
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,990
Body paragraph 2: it’s not the government’s
job to be a parent to people

91
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:25,939
Conclusion: people are free to make whatever
unhealthy choices they want

92
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:30,789
Here’s another possibility:

93
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:36,449
Body paragraph 1: people’s unhealthy choices
have a negative effect on other people and

94
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:41,509
society as a whole
Body paragraph 2: the government should make

95
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:45,470
unhealthy lifestyle choices expensive, difficult
or illegal

96
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:51,770
Conclusion: people are not free to make any
unhealthy choices they want, and the government

97
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:59,030
has a duty to intervene
Finally, here’s a third possible plan:

98
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:04,389
Body paragraph 1: people are free to decide
what to do with their own bodies

99
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:09,830
Body paragraph 2: people’s unhealthy choices
have a negative effect on other people and

100
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,979
society as a whole
Body paragraph 3: the government should encourage

101
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,580
healthier choices, and discourage less healthy
ones

102
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:25,660
Conclusion: people are free to make whatever
unhealthy choices they want, but the government

103
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,449
should also push people towards making healthier
choices

104
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:33,580
Which plan is better?

105
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,229
They’re all good plans.

106
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:37,969
One isn’t better than another.

107
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:42,199
And, of course, there are many other possibilities!

108
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,340
It depends on the ideas you have.

109
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,340
For this lesson, we’re going to use the
third plan to write a model IELTS essay.

110
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,729
Let’s review quickly: your plan needs to
do two things.

111
00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:01,659
One: your plan needs to be consistent with
your conclusion, so that all your ideas support

112
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,400
your final point.

113
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,800
Two: you need to have one (and only one) main
idea in each body paragraph.

114
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,660
At this point, you’re ready for the next
step.

115
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,639
There are three things you can do in your
introduction:

116
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,340
First, you can provide a ‘hook’: something
which shows why the topic you’re writing

117
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,569
about is interesting or relevant.

118
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:35,720
This could be some background information,
a rhetorical question, an interesting fact,

119
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,680
or something similar.

120
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:45,579
Secondly, you can reframe the question to
show how you are going to approach it, and

121
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:50,380
how you are interpreting the key ideas in
the task.

122
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:56,300
Finally, you need to give an indication of
what your essay will talk about, and what

123
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,750
your conclusion will be.

124
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,780
The first part is the least important.

125
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,660
If you can think of a good hook, great!

126
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,950
If not, don’t worry about it.

127
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:15,320
The second part—reframing the question—is
important if you’re aiming for higher scores.

128
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,560
If you’re aiming for a lower score, you
don’t have to do this.

129
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:26,570
Be careful with reframing and paraphrasing;
many IELTS candidates have problems with this.

130
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,490
Not doing it at all is better than doing it
badly.

131
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,560
The third part is essential.

132
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,430
Your introduction must signal which direction
you intend to take, and what your conclusion

133
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,920
will be.

134
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,480
This shows the examiner that you have a coherent
plan, and you know where you are going.

135
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,320
Let’s look now at a model introduction:

136
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,510
Are you free to destroy your own health?

137
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:59,260
If I want to smoke 60 cigarettes a day, eat
fast food for every meal, or drink a litre

138
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,120
of vodka daily, am I free to do so?

139
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,760
In this essay, I will show that while you
cannot stop people from making bad choices,

140
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:17,839
the government can and should play an active
role in encouraging people to live more healthily.

141
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,019
You can see all three parts in this introduction.

142
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,990
The first sentence is partly a hook, partly
a reframing of the question.

143
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:32,910
You’re using a rhetorical question to address
the topic directly.

144
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:38,600
The second sentence reframes the question
in terms of personal freedoms.

145
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,680
This is relevant, because in the body of the
essay we’re going to focus on this aspect

146
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,730
of the task.

147
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:52,550
The third sentence explains very clearly where
the essay will go.

148
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:57,410
Reading this, the examiner will know what
your conclusion is going to be.

149
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:04,560
That’s a good thing: in a coherent essay,
your conclusion should not be a surprise.

150
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,180
Let’s review quickly: when you write an
introduction, you absolutely must signal which

151
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,100
direction you’ll take, and what your conclusion
will be.

152
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,269
You should consider reframing the question
to highlight the ideas you want to focus on

153
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:22,449
in your essay.

154
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:29,500
You can optionally include a hook or some
background information, but it isn’t necessary.

155
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:37,620
After your introduction, you need to move
on to your body paragraphs.

156
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,110
Start your body paragraph by writing a topic
sentence.

157
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,529
The topic sentence summarises the main idea
of your paragraph.

158
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:54,610
Let’s remember the plan we’re using:
So, our topic sentence for the first body

159
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,440
paragraph could be the sentence from the plan:

160
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,759
People are free to decide what to do with
their own bodies.

161
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,820
Or, you could say something more sophisticated,
like:

162
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,730
People frequently make self-destructive choices,
and to a certain extent they should be free

163
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,970
to do so.

164
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:21,209
This is better, not only because it uses more
advanced grammar and vocabulary, but also

165
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:27,139
because it also signals the conclusion: people
are free to make bad choices, but that freedom

166
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:29,040
has limits.

167
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,810
After your topic sentence, you need to develop
your idea by going into more detail.

168
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,230
For example:

169
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:44,670
Choosing what to eat or drink, how much exercise
to do, how many hours to sleep, and whether

170
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:51,139
to smoke or not are personal matters and very
basic freedoms.

171
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:57,010
This is fundamentally the same idea as the
topic sentence, but more detailed.

172
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:02,940
Where the topic sentence is general, the second
sentence is more specific.

173
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:08,910
If possible, add an example to support your
point, like this:

174
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:15,360
For example, consider a man who does no exercise
and regularly eats large amounts of processed

175
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,880
junk food.

176
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,670
His habits are clearly unhealthy, but equally
clearly they are his decisions to make.

177
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:28,910
You can see that the paragraph starts with
a generalisation, and then gets more and more

178
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,480
specific.

179
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,230
This is a good pattern to follow in your body
paragraphs.

180
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:40,300
Finally, it’s good to end your paragraph
with a mini-conclusion which restates the

181
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,259
central idea of the paragraph:

182
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:50,080
It is hard even to imagine a world in which
people are forced to exercise regularly, or

183
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:58,140
prevented from eating what they wanted; the
idea is manifestly ridiculous.

184
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:04,360
So, in the last sentence you’re going back
to generalisation, but using the specific

185
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,500
ideas you mentioned in the paragraph.

186
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,420
Maybe you’re thinking, “That’s easy
for you, but I don’t have the vocabulary

187
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,540
to write something like that.”

188
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:20,029
Maybe, maybe not, but you can still follow
the same ideas.

189
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:27,829
Start with a topic sentence, go into more
detail, add an example if possible, and then

190
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:32,920
restate the central idea of the paragraph
at the end.

191
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:39,519
Follow the same structure for your remaining
body paragraphs, and then it’s time to write

192
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,360
your conclusion.

193
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,300
When writing a conclusion, you need to do
two things:

194
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,360
One: state your opinion clearly.

195
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,680
Two: connect all of the key ideas from the
task that you’ve discussed in your body

196
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,560
paragraphs.

197
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,070
Start your conclusion with a very clear, direct
statement of your opinion.

198
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,140
For example:

199
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:12,579
I strongly agree that everyone should be free
to make their own lifestyle choices, including

200
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,279
unhealthy choices.

201
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,420
The government should do more to discourage
people from making unhealthy lifestyle choices.

202
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,209
Both of the views expressed in the question
are correct.

203
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:31,100
This shows the examiner that you’re addressing
the question directly and that you have a

204
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,170
clear opinion.

205
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:37,259
This has a big effect on your IELTS writing
score.

206
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:42,980
Next, you need to connect the key ideas from
the task that you’ve discussed in your body

207
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,000
paragraphs.

208
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,620
Be careful not to simply repeat ideas.

209
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,209
Look at a model conclusion now:

210
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:55,090
Both of the views expressed in the question
are correct.

211
00:15:55,090 --> 00:16:01,440
People are, and should be, free to make unhealthy
lifestyle choices if they want to.

212
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,850
However, because of the wider impact of such
choices, the government also has a responsibility

213
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:15,490
to encourage healthier lifestyles and disincentivise
unhealthy habits.

214
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:22,259
You can see that we cover the idea of personal
freedom from paragraph one, the idea that

215
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:29,630
individual choices have broader consequences
from paragraph two, and the idea that the

216
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:36,470
government should encourage people to make
healthier choices from paragraph three.

217
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:42,550
This is a strong conclusion, because it provides
a clear position, and also connects everything

218
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,720
together in a coherent way.
