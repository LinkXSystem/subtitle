00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,650
In this lesson, you can learn how to understand
fast speech.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,719
You’ll see how to understand fast English
speakers more easily.

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,510
You’ll also get a simple, step-by-step plan
to improve your ability to understand fast

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,840
speech in English.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,400
Before we start, you should take a look at
our website: Oxford Online English dot com.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,540
You can use our free English lessons to practise,
including many listening lessons.

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,700
You can also take online classes to improve
your English with our professional teachers.

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,460
But now, let’s see one of the most useful
things you can do if you want to understand

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,520
fast speech better in English.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,130
Imagine a situation: you’re going to the
airport to meet someone who’s arriving.

13
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,100
You’ve never met this person before, but
you have a photo.

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,920
The photo does not look *anything* like the
person you’re supposed to meet.

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,860
What do you think?

16
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,700
Will you be able to recognise this person?

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,020
Obviously not.

18
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:17,580
There’s a similar connection between understanding
spoken language and pronunciation.

19
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,130
If you don’t know how to pronounce words
and sentences correctly, then you won’t

20
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,790
recognise them when you hear them.

21
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:30,120
More specifically, if you don’t know about
the features of native English pronunciation,

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,740
then you’ll find it difficult to understand
any natural speech.

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,890
So, what are these ‘features’ of native
English pronunciation?

24
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,000
What should you work on?

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,180
Let’s look at an example: ‘That house
looks smaller from the outside.’

26
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,230
‘That house looks smaller from the outside.’

27
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,340
Even in this short sentence, a lot is happening.

28
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,880
First, the ‘t’ at the end of ‘that’
is generally not fully pronounced.

29
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,810
In British English, it would be reduced to
a glottal ‘t’, which means that you start

30
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,030
pronouncing a /t/ sound, but you never fully
release it.

31
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:15,470
In American English, the /t/ might also be
softened to a /d/ sound.

32
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,500
Next, the words are all joined together.

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,480
‘House looks’ sounds like ‘how slooks’.

34
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,210
In fact, all of the words are linked, so that
the whole sentence is pronounced as one sound.

35
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:35,980
‘From’ is pronounced weakly, so you say
/frəm/ and not /frɒm/.

36
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:42,540
The last two words—‘the outside’—are
linked by adding a /j/ sound in the middle:

37
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,220
‘the_/j/_outside’.

38
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,530
There are many pronunciation points to be
aware of here.

39
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,620
We won’t go into more detail, because we’ve
covered many of these points in other videos.

40
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:00,740
However, here’s the main point: if you don’t
know about these pronunciation features, you’ll

41
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,340
struggle to understand *any* English speech.

42
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,140
You might feel like all speech is “too fast”.

43
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,080
Actually, the speed might not be the problem.

44
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,460
Connected, fluent speech can sound much faster
if you’re not aware of these pronunciation

45
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,170
features.

46
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:25,300
You don’t need to be able to use these pronunciation
features perfectly, but you should know about

47
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,100
them and be able to use them at least sometimes.

48
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:35,010
Then, you’ll find it much easier to understand
native English at any speed.

49
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,970
So, what should you focus on?

50
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:44,230
The most important points are weak forms,
linking, stress, and schwa sounds.

51
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:50,060
There are others, but if you have a good understanding
of these four pronunciation topics, your listening

52
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,730
ability will improve.

53
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,800
Check out our pronunciation videos for more
details on these points.

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,360
If you want to go into more depth, we can
recommend the Pronunciation in Use series

55
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,430
of books.

56
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,240
You can find links in the video description.

57
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,959
Working on your pronunciation is the most
useful way to improve your ability to understand

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:18,080
fast English speech, but what else should
you think about?

59
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:25,000
There’s a proverb in English: you have to
learn to walk before you can learn to run.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,240
In the same way, many English learners who
say they can’t understand fast speech also

61
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,370
have problems understanding slower speech.

62
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:40,460
We hope it’s obvious that if you can’t
understand slower speech well, then you’ll

63
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,120
struggle with faster speakers.

64
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,220
This might sound too obvious.

65
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,780
However, many English learners realise that
they have difficulties understanding fast

66
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:57,380
speech, but don’t realise that they also
have problems with slower speech.

67
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,580
First, you need to test your ability to understand
slower speech.

68
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,360
To do this, you’ll need four things.

69
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,060
One: you need a video or audio file which
is not too easy and not too difficult.

70
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,620
English textbooks often have listening exercises
which are carefully designed for a specific

71
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,620
level.

72
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,449
If you don’t know where to find good listening
materials, then use English textbooks as a

73
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,530
starting point.

74
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,190
We also have many listening lessons on our
website: Oxford Online English dot com.

75
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,650
Two: you need a way to control the playback
speed.

76
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,360
You can use a YouTube video, where you can
use the speed controls to set the playback

77
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,610
speed to point seven-five or point five.

78
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:49,480
Or, you can use VLC media player, which has
speed controls, so you can play something

79
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,360
at 90 per cent speed, 80 per cent, and so
on.

80
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,080
VLC is probably better, because you can control
the playback speed more precisely.

81
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,370
By the way, if you have other suggestions
for tools to listen at variable speeds, let

82
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,030
us know in the comments!

83
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,650
Three: you need an accurate transcript of
the audio or video.

84
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:19,650
For example, you could use a YouTube video
which has subtitles, or a song where you have

85
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,250
the lyrics.

86
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,720
Be careful with YouTube subtitles, as many
of them are automatically generated, and these

87
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,200
are not generally accurate.

88
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,570
Four: you need a pen and paper.

89
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,600
Your goal is to test how well you understand
slow speech.

90
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,720
So, take your video or audio.

91
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,000
Adjust the playback speed until it feels easy
to you.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,120
Listen to a few sentences to get warmed up.

93
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,820
Next, pause the playback at the end of a sentence.

94
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:58,600
Listen to the next sentence, pause the playback,
then write the sentence down.

95
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,430
Check against the written transcript.

96
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:07,280
If you’re using a song, then work in lines
instead of sentences.

97
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,699
At this stage, you need to be really strict
with yourself.

98
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,700
Double check what you’ve written against
the transcript.

99
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:22,320
Count your mistakes: every missing word is
one mistake, every wrong word is one mistake,

100
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,270
and every extra word is one mistake.

101
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,490
If you want, try it right now!

102
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,680
It’s a good experiment.

103
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,340
How many mistakes did you make?

104
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:41,210
If you made more than one mistake, then adjust
the playback speed down, so that the audio

105
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,759
is slower.

106
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,320
Listen to the next sentence and do the same.

107
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,199
Repeat until you find a speed where you can
write down the sentence you heard without

108
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,520
making more than one mistake.

109
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,229
This is an important step, because you need
to build a base for your listening skills.

110
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:05,800
That means you need to be able to hear every
word, and you need to be able to hold a sentence

111
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,640
in your head after you’ve heard it.

112
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:15,580
Again, it’s essential to be strict with
yourself and pay attention to small details.

113
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:21,139
Actually, even making one or two mistakes
is a problem.

114
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,919
Your aim is to write down the sentences without
making any mistakes.

115
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,240
If you can’t do this even at slow playback
speeds, then you need to find something easier

116
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,880
to listen to.

117
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,510
Find something which you can understand at
70 per cent or 80 per cent of full speed.

118
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,610
Remember that ‘understand’ means that
you hear every word.

119
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,839
It’s not enough for this to understand the
general meaning.

120
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,420
You need to hear every single word perfectly.

121
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,860
Take your time on this practice, and get it
right.

122
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:01,920
Once you’re comfortable with this, you’re
ready for the next step.

123
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,580
Actually, if you’ve done the exercise from
part two, then you’ve already done the most

124
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,480
important work.

125
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:17,579
To understand faster speech, you do the same
things, but increase the playback speed gradually.

126
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:23,860
Listen to one sentence, write it down, and
check it carefully against the written transcript.

127
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:30,480
If you can get three sentences in a row 100
per cent right, then adjust the playback speed

128
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,500
up and continue.

129
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,550
On the other hand, if you make more than one
mistake in a sentence, then adjust the playback

130
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,420
speed down.

131
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:45,980
You have the same goal: you need to hear every
single word.

132
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,790
Try to get to a playback speed of 120% or
130%.

133
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:57,249
If you can hear every word even at these speeds,
then find something more challenging to practise

134
00:09:57,249 --> 00:09:59,970
with and start again.

135
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,679
For this, you need to be patient.

136
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:08,360
If you do this regularly, you *will* make
good progress, but your progress will not

137
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,440
be a straight line.

138
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,759
There will be days and weeks where you don’t
feel like you’re getting anywhere.

139
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,559
Don’t give up!

140
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:22,550
With any work like this, it’s better to
do it little and often.

141
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,490
Start by doing ten to fifteen minutes of practice
every day.

142
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,970
Do this for a week or so.

143
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,720
If you’re feeling motivated, go up to half
an hour a day.

144
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,959
Don’t try to do too much; doing it regularly
is the most important thing.

145
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,360
As with all listening practice, you should
try to use a variety of listening sources.

146
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,899
Listen to different sources, on different
topics, and with different speakers and accents.

147
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:53,220
This is the core of your training.

148
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:59,630
If you do this regularly, your ability to
understand fast speech will improve quickly.

149
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:05,300
However, you have to be consistent, and you
have to be strict with yourself regarding

150
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,300
mistakes.

151
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,939
Otherwise, you won’t get such good results.

152
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:17,320
There’s one more point you should think
about to understand fast speech better.

153
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,920
There’s a feeling you get sometimes when
you’re listening to a foreign language.

154
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:27,239
It’s that feeling when everything is coming
too fast, there are too many words you don’t

155
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:29,310
know, and you’re fighting to keep up.

156
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,399
But, at some point things break down, and
what you’re hearing turns into soup.

157
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,920
You know the feeling?

158
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,730
It’s common.

159
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,589
It’s what happens when there is too much
for your brain to process.

160
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:49,110
There are no quick fixes; there aren’t any
magic solutions, and you’ve already seen

161
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,540
the most important points you can use to deal
with this.

162
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,800
But, there’s one more thing you can do.

163
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,980
Vocabulary is a big part of understanding.

164
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:03,610
In particular, when you hear a word you don’t
know, it often takes your attention.

165
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,870
You start wondering what it was and what it
means.

166
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:12,819
While you’re paying attention to that unfamiliar
word, you can’t pay attention to what you’re

167
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:16,149
hearing, so you miss more things.

168
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:19,259
This makes it more difficult to tune back
in.

169
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,920
At some point, you get the ‘soup effect’,
and you can’t understand most of what you’re

170
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,720
hearing.

171
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,360
This isn’t just about vocabulary.

172
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,910
It also depends on pronunciation and speed,
which we’ve already talked about.

173
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,739
It sometimes depends on grammar, too.

174
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:43,869
So, your listening practice should be supported
by language work, especially vocabulary work,

175
00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:47,939
but also grammar work if your grammar is weak.

176
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:53,050
If you hear a word which you don’t know
or don’t understand, that will always be

177
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,610
a problem.

178
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:01,290
You can find many other videos on our channel
to help you learn vocabulary, as well as grammar

179
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,819
if you need it.

180
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:05,730
Let’s finish with a challenge.

181
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,920
Can you use the training techniques you saw
in this lesson every day for one month?

182
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,990
Try to do at least ten minutes a day, every
day for one month.

183
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:22,980
If you make it, tell us in the comments, and
let us know if you feel a difference or not.

184
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,999
Thanks for watching!

185
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,339
See you next time!
