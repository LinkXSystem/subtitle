00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:10,380
Hi, I’m Martin. Welcome to Oxford Online
English! In this lesson, you can learn about

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,820
countable and uncountable nouns in English.

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:23,210
What’s the difference between paper and
a paper? Why do we say trousers are… but

4
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,939
news is…? Why can’t you say, Can you give
me an advice?

5
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,160
You’ll learn the answers to all these questions
in this lesson.

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,150
Where shall we start?

7
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:48,770
Some nouns are countable. You can count them.
For example, pens are countable. You can count

8
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,900
them.

9
00:00:52,900 --> 00:01:00,310
One pen, two pens, three pens, and so on.

10
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:12,899
Some nouns are uncountable. You can’t count
them. For example, water is uncountable.

11
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:22,979
One water, two waters…? No, that doesn’t
work. You can’t count water.

12
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,070
Do you know any other uncountable nouns?

13
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:40,639
You’ll see more examples in the next section,
but here are three: money, rice and knowledge

14
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:44,680
are all uncountable nouns.

15
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:53,509
Countable and uncountable nouns behave differently.
They follow different rules.

16
00:01:53,509 --> 00:02:03,909
First, uncountable nouns can’t be plural.
That means you can’t say moneys, rices or

17
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:08,539
knowledges. These forms don’t exist.

18
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:18,470
Secondly, you need to use a singular verb
with uncountable nouns. For example:

19
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:26,610
This rice doesn’t taste right.
Your money is on the table.

20
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,290
His knowledge of this subject has improved
significantly.

21
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:43,101
Next, you can’t use a or an with an uncountable
noun. You can’t say a rice, a money or a

22
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:50,620
knowledge. However, you can use some or any.
For example:

23
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:57,810
Is there any rice left?
You’ll need some money for the bus.

24
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:06,200
Finally, we use different words to talk about
quantities with countable and uncountable

25
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,210
nouns.

26
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:14,590
With countable nouns, we use many to talk
about large quantities, and few to talk about

27
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,830
small quantities.

28
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:24,930
With uncountable nouns, we use much and little.

29
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:35,240
You can use a lot of or lots of with both
countable and uncountable nouns.

30
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,520
For example:

31
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:44,680
There isn’t much rice left, but There aren’t
many potatoes left.

32
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:56,240
There’s a little money in my pocket, but
There are a few coins in that small box.

33
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:05,260
Okay, so now you know the basics about uncountable
nouns and how to use them.

34
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,350
Next, an important question:

35
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:23,360
Many uncountable nouns are words for food
and drink, such as pasta, meat, fruit, coffee,

36
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,100
beer or milk.

37
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:36,380
Be careful, because fruit is uncountable,
but vegetables are countable.

38
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,690
Many collective nouns are uncountable.

39
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:49,410
Collective nouns are nouns which describe
a group of objects all together. For example,

40
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:55,590
furniture, equipment, luggage or traffic.

41
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:07,560
Finally, abstract nouns are often uncountable.
For example: knowledge, information, advice

42
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
or progress.

43
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,980
Okay, I have a challenge for you.

44
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:22,440
You have three groups of nouns here: food
& drink, collective nouns, and abstract nouns.

45
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:35,060
I want you to pause the video and find one
more uncountable noun to add to each group.

46
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:43,680
That means you need to find one uncountable
food or drink noun, one uncountable collective

47
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:53,000
noun, and one uncountable abstract noun. Write
down your answers.

48
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,080
Why are you still here? Pause the video and
find your answers!

49
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,790
Okay, finished?

50
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,980
But, there’s a problem.

51
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:14,389
There are many possible answers you could
have here. How can you check?

52
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:22,800
Easy: find a dictionary. You can use an online
dictionary such as Longman, or a paper dictionary

53
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,730
if you’re feeling a bit old school.

54
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:35,091
Look up the words you wrote down. In the dictionary,
it should tell you if they’re countable

55
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:40,949
or uncountable.

56
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:48,889
Some dictionaries do this by adding a ‘u’
for uncountable or a ‘c’ for countable

57
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:54,300
after the noun. Different dictionaries have
different styles.

58
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:03,940
So now you can check your answers. Were you
correct?

59
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,010
Now, things get more complicated.

60
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,320
Why?

61
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:19,340
If nouns could only be countable or uncountable,
this topic would be very simple.

62
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:29,600
However, many nouns can be both countable
and uncountable, with different meanings.

63
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:37,639
For example, paper can be countable or uncountable.

64
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:48,200
Do you know the difference? What’s the difference
between paper and a paper?

65
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:55,080
Paper is the material: what you write on.

66
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:03,280
A paper is another way to say a newspaper

67
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:15,620
Let’s look at some more examples like this.
Think about it: what’s the difference between:

68
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:24,870
Fish and a fish?
Glass and a glass?

69
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,310
Time and a time?

70
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:37,110
Ready? Let’s look at the answers:

71
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:43,550
Fish (uncountable) means the food. You eat
fish.

72
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:55,370
A fish (countable) means one whole animal,
either living or dead. Compare:

73
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:01,330
We eat a lot of fish. --> We eat a lot of
fish in general.

74
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:08,740
There’s a fish in the toilet! --> One living
fish.

75
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:15,990
He ate three whole fish. --> Three whole animals.

76
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:21,160
What about glass and a glass?

77
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:29,890
Glass is a material. A glass is something
you drink out of. For example:

78
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:38,320
The sculpture was made of glass.
Would you like a glass of water?

79
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:46,370
Finally, how about time and a time?

80
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:53,600
Time is the general meaning of time. It’s
such a basic idea that I can’t really explain

81
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,990
it in more simple terms!

82
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:05,070
A time has a similar meaning to an occasion
or a period.

83
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,130
Look at some examples:

84
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:16,140
I don’t have much free time.
How much time will you need to finish this?

85
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,250
There have been many times when I wanted to
give up.

86
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,350
We had a good time at their barbecue.

87
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,790
Can you see the difference now?

88
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:41,060
So, there are many nouns which can be both
countable and uncountable, often with different

89
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,640
meanings.

90
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:51,529
There are too many examples to explain them
all here, but I will give you one general

91
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:55,480
idea which might be helpful.

92
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:06,040
Often, when a noun can be countable or uncountable,
the uncountable noun has a general or collective

93
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:13,209
meaning. The countable noun has a specific
meaning.

94
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:21,600
For example, think about the word hair. It
can be countable or uncountable.

95
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:30,089
Hair (uncountable) has a general meaning.
It means, for example, the stuff that grows

96
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,020
on your head.

97
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:39,350
Hair (countable) has a more specific meaning.

98
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:46,120
Have you ever made the mistake in English
where you say something like:

99
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,700
My friend Jacob has a long hair.

100
00:11:50,700 --> 00:12:00,850
If you say this, you mean that your friend
has one long hair. That’s probably not what

101
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,339
you wanted to say, right?

102
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:07,339
Instead, say:

103
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:13,750
My friend Jacob has long hair.

104
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:21,820
To really understand countable and uncountable
nouns, you’ll have to remember a lot of

105
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:30,990
information. However, this basic idea can
help you: uncountable nouns are more general

106
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:39,720
and abstract; countable nouns are more specific.

107
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:47,880
In this lesson, we’ve talked about countable
nouns, uncountable nouns, and nouns which

108
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,610
can be both.

109
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:58,680
There are a few strange nouns, which don’t
fit cleanly into any of these categories.

110
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:05,850
For example, we said at the beginning that
uncountable nouns can’t be plural. You can’t

111
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,340
say rices or knowledges.

112
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:20,399
That’s generally true, but there are some
uncountable nouns which can only be plural.

113
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,140
They are:

114
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,790
police
clothes

115
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:32,950
trousers
scissors

116
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:43,730
You can’t make these nouns singular. You
can’t say one police or one trouser.

117
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:50,980
Remember to use a plural verb with these nouns.
For example:

118
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:59,850
The police have interviewed all the witnesses.
These trousers don’t fit well.

119
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,269
Careful with the scissors—they’re sharp.

120
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:15,820
Another strange word is news. It’s uncountable
and singular, even though it ends with ‘s’.

121
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,060
So, don’t say:

122
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,500
The news are depressing at the moment.

123
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,040
Instead, say:

124
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,450
The news is depressing at the moment.

125
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:41,360
Finally, there are some collective nouns like
staff, team or crew. Some of these are uncountable

126
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:49,330
(like staff), and others can be countable,
like team or crew.

127
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:56,570
These nouns are generally made plural in British
English. In the UK, we say:

128
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:04,350
The staff aren’t happy with the new uniform.
The team are playing well at the moment.

129
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:15,680
However, in the US, these collective nouns
are often singular. In the US, you might hear:

130
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,610
The staff isn’t happy with the new uniform.
The team is playing well at the moment.

131
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:31,800
Both are possible, but try to be consistent.
If you make these nouns plural, then they

132
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:38,890
should always be plural. If you make them
singular, you should always make them singular.

133
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:48,180
That said, native speakers aren’t always
consistent. Don’t worry about it too much,

134
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,060
and don’t be surprised if you hear both
forms.

135
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,209
Okay, we have one more thing to do.

136
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:05,050
The point of uncountable nouns is that you
can’t count them.

137
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:09,870
But sometimes you need to.

138
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,709
What can you do?

139
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:18,500
Take an uncountable noun you saw earlier:
rice.

140
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:27,510
There’s no way to count rice directly. Rice
can never be countable. You can never say

141
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,820
three rices.

142
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:36,700
But, sometimes you need to count things, even
if they’re uncountable. How can you count

143
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,270
rice?

144
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:45,800
Actually, there are many ways to do it.

145
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:56,889
Rice is made up of single grains of rice.
Here is one grain of rice.

146
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:05,910
You can also have a bag of rice, a packet
of rice, or a portion of rice.

147
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:13,240
By adding a noun + of, you can make an uncountable
noun countable.

148
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:21,500
Let’s see how this works in some example
sentences:

149
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:28,600
There was a single grain of rice left at the
bottom of his bowl.

150
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:39,230
Can you get two of those big bags of rice?
We’d like three portions of rice, please.

151
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:46,419
Like with rice, there are often many different
nouns you can add to make an uncountable noun

152
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:48,049
countable.

153
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:57,450
That’s the good news. The bad news is that
you need to add different nouns depending

154
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:01,500
on the uncountable noun you’re using.

155
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,860
Let’s practice this so you can see what
I mean.

156
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:12,950
Here are five uncountable nouns. How could
you make them countable?

157
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,950
advice
bread

158
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,950
money
furniture

159
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,950
coffee

160
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,640
Think about your answers.

161
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,730
Ready? Let’s look together.

162
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:31,740
You can give someone a piece of advice, or
two pieces of advice if you’re feeling generous.

163
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,760
Add a piece of to make advice countable.

164
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:46,290
A piece of is very useful, because you can
use it to make many uncountable nouns countable.

165
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:54,700
You can also have a piece of bread. With bread
you have other possibilities: a loaf of bread

166
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,400
or a slice of bread.

167
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:07,110
What about money? You can have a sum of money
or an amount of money. For example, you could

168
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,110
say:

169
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:14,290
He lost a large amount of money trying to
play the stock market.

170
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:24,620
For furniture, you could say a piece of furniture
or possibly an item of furniture, although

171
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,970
this is very formal, and not common.

172
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:37,470
Finally, what about coffee? You can have a
cup of coffee, a packet of coffee, a spoonful

173
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,260
of coffee, or a pot of coffee.

174
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:46,890
In all of these cases, there are other possible
answers. However, these are the most common

175
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,890
ones.

176
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:57,030
