00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:02,980
Hi, I’m Marie.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,690
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:09,720
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to talk
about your daily routine in English.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,680
What do you do every day?

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,719
What’s a typical day like for you?

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,760
In this class, you’ll learn everything you
need to talk about your daily routine, including

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,890
work, free time, meals, and sleep habits.

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,140
Before we start, we really think you should
visit our website: Oxford Online English dot

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,140
com.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,750
You can find all of our free English lessons,
including videos and listening lessons.

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,540
You can also take online classes with one
of our professional teachers.

12
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:49,560
Let’s start by looking at how you can talk
about your everyday working routine.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,480
You’re working freelance now, right?

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,480
Yeah, that’s right.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,640
I’ve been doing it for about six months
now.

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,750
That must be nice.

17
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,520
You can work from home; you don’t have to
deal with bad bosses…

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,200
Yeah, it has its pluses, but it’s not all fun
and games.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,450
Obviously, my work is more flexible, but I
still have to be disciplined and make sure

20
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,840
I stick to a schedule.

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,609
So, what’s your working day like?

22
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:15,690
I like to get an early start, so I get up
at eight and I work from eight-thirty to around

23
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,690
midday.

24
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,369
Then, I take a long lunch break, maybe go
to the gym or something like that.

25
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,139
Then, I do another three to four hours in
the evening, so I finish at seven or eight.

26
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:27,280
That’s quite a late finish.

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,180
Yeah, but it suits me.

28
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,490
I get sleepy in the afternoon, so it’s not
the best time to work.

29
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,680
That still sounds much nicer than working
a regular job.

30
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,720
I have to get up at six-thirty, then my commute
takes around an hour, so I have to leave the

31
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,840
house at half seven at the latest.

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,969
I’m at the office from eight-thirty till
five-thirty or six, then I don’t get home

33
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:51,210
until seven at the earliest.

34
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:57,679
I have to say: working at home has some disadvantages,
but I don’t miss commuting every day.

35
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:58,889
No, you shouldn’t.

36
00:01:58,889 --> 00:01:59,889
It sucks!

37
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:02,289
Do you work the same hours every day?

38
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,600
More or less.

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,620
Sometimes I stay late if there’s something
I need to finish, but I try to leave on time.

40
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,900
Otherwise, I don’t get any time at home
before I go to bed.

41
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,320
Here are some questions for you based on the
dialogue:

42
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,720
What’s your working day like?

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,140
What time do you start and finish?

44
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,080
Do you often work long hours?

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,220
Do you take any breaks during the day?

46
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,800
Let’s see how you could answer questions
like these.

47
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,540
Let’s start with something easy: what time
do you start and finish?

48
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:47,760
You could say something like: ‘I start work
at nine, and I finish at five.’

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,430
Maybe you have a more flexible schedule.

50
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,610
You might say: ‘I’m a freelancer, so I
work different hours every day.

51
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,480
It depends what I have to do.’

52
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,800
If you’re busy, you could say things like:
‘I often have to stay late at work.’

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,400
‘I finish at seven o’clock at the earliest.’

54
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,920
‘I can only take a short lunch break.’

55
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,780
If you have a more relaxed workday, you might say:

56
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,880
'I take a long break in the afternoon'.

57
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,860
'I usually finish work by five-thirty at the latest'.

58
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,340
‘I never stay late or do overtime.’

59
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:38,340
The phrases ‘at the earliest’ and ‘at
the latest’ are useful if you want to talk

60
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,960
about extremes.

61
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:49,410
Otherwise, use adverbs like ‘often’ or
‘usually’.

62
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,470
What about you?

63
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,819
What’s your working day like?

64
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,439
Try to make two to three sentences talking
about your working routine.

65
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,239
If you need to, you can review the dialogue
to get some ideas for language you can use.

66
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,100
Pause the video and make your answer now.

67
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,000
Practise saying it out loud!

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,600
How was that?

69
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,820
Let’s look at our next point.

70
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,220
So, what do you do in the evenings after work?

71
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:26,290
Honestly, most days I’m so tired when I
get home that I just crash on the sofa and

72
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,290
watch TV.

73
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,220
I don’t like it, but I don’t have the
energy to do much else.

74
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,990
I play tennis on Wednesdays, but that’s
it.

75
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,190
I know the feeling.

76
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,220
It’s hard to motivate yourself when you’ve
been at work all day.

77
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,300
What about you?

78
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,300
I’m the opposite.

79
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,280
I’m stuck at home all day, so when I’m
free, I’m desperate to get out of the house:

80
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,620
do some exercise, talk to people…

81
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,920
I try to arrange something most evenings.

82
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,360
What kind of thing do you do?

83
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,640
Lots of stuff!

84
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,040
I’ve started going to a boxing class twice
a week, and I also play basketball with a

85
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,590
group of friends every Thursday.

86
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,780
Then, I’ll generally go out with friends
for a coffee or a drink on one or two evenings,

87
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,660
too.

88
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,360
Wow!

89
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,860
You’re pretty busy.

90
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,880
Yeah, but I prefer it that way.

91
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:13,110
I’m more active on weekends, but during
the work week, there just isn’t the time.

92
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:19,140
Here’s a question: what do you do in the
evenings after work?

93
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,480
Are you active?

94
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,980
Do you like going out and doing lots of different
things, or do you prefer to stay at home and

95
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,270
relax?

96
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,960
If you’re more active, you could say something
like:

97
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,060
‘I like to get out of the house when I can.’

98
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,960
‘I try to arrange something most evenings.’

99
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,960
‘I prefer to stay busy.’

100
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,020
If you prefer staying at home, you might say:
‘I don’t have the energy to do much after

101
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,780
work.’

102
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,860
‘I just crash on the sofa and watch TV when
I get home.’

103
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:06,060
‘During the work week, there just isn’t
the time to do much.’

104
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,300
It’s also useful to say how often you do
things.

105
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:17,810
Here, you can use adverbs like ‘often’,
‘generally’, ‘sometimes’ or ‘occasionally.’

106
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:23,380
You can also use time phrases like ‘once
a week’, ‘on Wednesdays’ or ‘every

107
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,220
Friday.’

108
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,480
For example: ‘I go out with friends once
a week.’

109
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,100
‘I go to the bouldering gym on Wednesdays.’

110
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,690
‘I generally go running around the park
after I get home.’

111
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,910
What about you?

112
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,810
What do you do after work?

113
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,620
If you don’t work, or you have a different
schedule, what do you do with your free time

114
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,620
during the day?

115
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,440
As usual, try to make two to three sentences
about yourself.

116
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,380
Use the language from this section to help
you.

117
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,340
Pause the video and do it now.

118
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,520
OK?

119
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,940
Let’s move on.

120
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,620
So, do you cook?

121
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,680
I mean, you’re at home all day, so you must
have time.

122
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,880
Yeah…

123
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,140
My meal habits are all over the place, though.

124
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,660
What do you mean?

125
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,390
Sometimes I skip meals, or I eat at weird
times.

126
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,280
I might eat dinner at seven-thirty, or I might
not eat until eleven.

127
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,730
It depends what I’m doing, and how hungry
I am.

128
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,930
That’s the exact opposite of my situation.

129
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:38,840
I have to eat at the same time every day,
because that’s the only time I have free.

130
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
What do you do for lunch?

131
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,140
If I’m organised, I’ll cook at the weekends
so I can take food with me to work.

132
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,770
Otherwise, I’ll buy a sandwich or something
from the bakery.

133
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,110
What about in the evenings?

134
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,390
Me and my boyfriend take turns cooking.

135
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,430
Then, we generally get a takeaway on Friday
evening if we’re at home.

136
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,770
That’s a good system.

137
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,280
It’s hard to motivate yourself to cook when
you live alone.

138
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,270
I try though, because I don’t want to waste
money on takeaways and eating out.

139
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,750
So, I’ll cook a big batch of something,
then freeze it and eat it for several days.

140
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,370
Here are some questions from the dialogue
which you should be able to answer by the

141
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,880
end of this section: ‘Do you cook?’

142
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,220
‘What do you do for lunch?’

143
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:27,670
‘Do you eat at the same times every day?’

144
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,649
Think about how you could answer these, but
first, let’s look at some more phrases you

145
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,060
heard in the dialogue.

146
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,070
Do you know what they mean?

147
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,760
‘My meal habits are all over the place.’

148
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,280
‘Sometimes I skip meals.’

149
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,340
‘I’ll cook a big batch of something, then
freeze it.’

150
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,760
Can you explain what these sentences mean?

151
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,890
If you say something is ‘all over the place’,
this means that there’s no pattern.

152
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:05,750
So, if your meal habits are all over the place,
it means you don’t eat regular meals at

153
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,830
regular times every day.

154
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,180
If you skip a meal, then you don’t eat it.

155
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,140
If you’re busy during the day, you might
have to skip lunch.

156
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,840
That means you don’t eat anything for lunch.

157
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:25,440
Finally, if you cook a big batch of something,
then you cook a lot at one time.

158
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,170
You might do this if you live alone, or if
you’re busy, so that you can freeze the

159
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,980
extra food and eat it later.

160
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,980
What about you?

161
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,490
Do you sometimes skip meals?

162
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,600
Do you buy lunch, or cook at home and take
food to work?

163
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,580
Do you ever get takeaways in the evening?

164
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,580
Make at least three sentences and talk about
your cooking and eating habits.

165
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,420
Make more sentences if you can!

166
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,380
Practise by saying your sentences out loud
several times, until you can produce them

167
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,170
fluently.

168
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,029
Remember that all the language you need is
in the dialogue.

169
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:09,860
Go back and review the dialogue if you need
some more ideas.

170
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,960
Pause the video and make your answer now.

171
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,330
How was that?

172
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,870
Could you make a fluent answer?

173
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,580
Take more time to practise if you need!

174
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:27,320
Let’s look at one more thing.

175
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,180
If you could choose, what working hours would
you do?

176
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,140
Is no hours an option?

177
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:37,360
Just imagine you’re working freelance like
me, and you can set your own timetable.

178
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,510
Would you still start early?

179
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,510
No way!

180
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,780
I’m a total night owl.

181
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,990
That’s one of the reasons I’m so jealous
of you.

182
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,780
I really struggle to get moving early in the
morning.

183
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,430
You see, I’m not exactly a morning person
either, but I like to get some stuff finished

184
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,710
early in the day.

185
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,770
It helps me to feel more productive.

186
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,180
Then, sometimes I take a nap in the afternoon,
because I often go to bed quite late.

187
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,680
I stay up late on weekends, but during the
week I’m in bed by eleven.

188
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,380
If I don’t get seven or eight hours of sleep,
I find it hard to focus at work.

189
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,380
Seven or eight?

190
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,460
I don’t think I sleep that much.

191
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,460
Why?

192
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,860
What time do you usually go to bed?

193
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,920
Around one.

194
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,820
One?!

195
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,120
That’s late.

196
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,130
Yes and no.

197
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,920
I don’t have to get up so early, so I can
still get a good night’s sleep.

198
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,570
In the dialogue, we were talking about sleeping
habits.

199
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:33,010
Here’s a question: are you a morning person
or a night owl?

200
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:37,120
If you haven’t guessed, a ‘night owl’
is someone who likes staying up late at night,

201
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,510
but probably isn’t good at getting up early
in the mornings.

202
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:50,610
Here are some questions for you to think about:
What time do you usually get up or go to sleep?

203
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:56,860
Do you find it easy to get up early in the
mornings?

204
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,620
How much sleep do you need every day?

205
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,840
Look at some useful language from
the dialogue which you could use.

206
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:12,620
Think about what these sentences mean: ‘I
really struggle to get moving in the morning.’

207
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,920
‘I stay up late on weekends.’

208
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,160
‘Sometimes I take a nap in the afternoon.’

209
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,320
Could you explain the meaning of these clearly?

210
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,410
If you struggle to get moving in the morning,
it means it’s difficult to get out of bed,

211
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,430
because you have no energy.

212
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:40,900
If you’re a night owl, you’ll probably
struggle to get moving in the morning.

213
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:46,490
If you stay up late, you go to bed late.

214
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:53,060
Taking a nap means that you have a short sleep
during the daytime.

215
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,800
So, now it’s time for your last practice!

216
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,960
Pause the video and make at least three sentences
about your sleeping habits.

217
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,200
Make a longer answer if you can.

218
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,440
Done?

219
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,200
Now you know how to talk about different parts
of your daily routine in English.

220
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,420
Thanks for watching!

221
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,460
See you next time!
