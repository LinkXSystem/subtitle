00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,420
Hi, I’m Gina.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,580
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:13,870
In this lesson, you can learn how to answer
job interview questions in English.

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,360
Have you ever had a job interview in English?

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:22,450
If English is not your first language, answering
job interview questions in English can add

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,750
stress to the experience.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:32,470
However, there are some simple, effective
tips you can use to give better answers to

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:37,670
job interview questions in clear, natural
English.

9
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,739
You’ll learn about these tips and tricks
during this lesson!

10
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:50,920
You’ll see eight common job interview questions
and four different techniques you can use.

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:58,039
You’ll see how to answer these common job
interview questions, using the techniques

12
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,789
we’ll show you.

13
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,410
Let’s start with our eight common job interview
questions.

14
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,270
Tell me a little about yourself.

15
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,490
Where do you see yourself five years from
now?

16
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:20,480
What are your strengths/weaknesses?

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,270
What is your leadership style?

18
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,520
Can you tell me about a time when you demonstrated
----?

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,900
--> For example, can you tell me about a time
when you demonstrated strong leadership?

20
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:43,290
Or, can you tell me about a time when you
demonstrated excellent customer service?

21
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,480
Tell me about a time you dealt with a challenging
situation at work.

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,130
Why do you want this job?

23
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:59,890
Why should we hire you?

24
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,330
What does concise mean?

25
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,230
It means that you don’t waste words.

26
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:15,049
If you speak concisely, you get right to the
point and don’t add anything unnecessary

27
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:16,760
to your answer.

28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,719
Let’s look at two questions in this section:

29
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,000
Tell me a little about yourself.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,989
Where do you see yourself five years from
now?

31
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:42,060
These are very common job interview questions,
and they’re also very open questions.

32
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,150
Open questions can be dangerous.

33
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,600
Do you know why?

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,260
It’s because you might ramble.

35
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,230
Ramble means to talk a lot without saying
much.

36
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,590
This won’t give the interviewer a good impression!

37
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:06,340
Let’s start by looking at a sample answer
to the question tell me a little about yourself.

38
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,549
Well, I was born in a small town in northern
Italy, where I also went to school.

39
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:16,799
I studied engineering at university and then…

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,820
So, after I graduated…

41
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:25,260
I mean, I did a master’s degree first, but
then I worked for a small firm in my hometown

42
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:29,170
for a few years, which was great fun.

43
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,129
After that…

44
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:34,780
Okay, we can stop there.

45
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,940
Do you think this is a good answer?

46
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,920
Why or why not?

47
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,740
It’s not a very good answer.

48
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,219
Why not?

49
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:54,650
There are three things the candidate does
which you should try to avoid:

50
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:01,440
One: the candidate includes lots of unnecessary
details.

51
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,000
Two: he doesn’t speak in full sentences.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,579
Three: he doesn’t have any clear direction.

53
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:20,820
If you do these things, your answer to this
answer will be long and unfocused.

54
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,460
What’s the solution?

55
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,330
You need to be more concise.

56
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,940
But how?

57
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,830
First, avoid unnecessary details.

58
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,490
Don’t give your entire work history; the
interviewers can get that from your CV if

59
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,440
they want it.

60
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,220
Secondly, speak in full sentences with a clear
beginning and end.

61
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,110
This means you need to be thinking ahead while
you speak.

62
00:04:51,110 --> 00:05:00,250
Thirdly, think about what you want to highlight
in your answer, and put it at the beginning.

63
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:06,180
This will give your answer a clear direction.

64
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,030
Let’s look at some examples of this:

65
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:14,169
I’ve always loved designing and building
things, so I suppose it’s natural that I

66
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:16,139
became an engineer.

67
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:23,289
I’ve worked in a variety of roles and companies,
which I’ve learned a lot from, but now I’m

68
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:27,419
ready for a new challenge.

69
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,500
What do you think?

70
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,460
Better?

71
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,420
It’s much better.

72
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,180
Let's look at the start.

73
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:42,410
Immediately, the candidate identifies a key
feature (he loves designing and building things),

74
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,580
and links it to his engineering career.

75
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:54,220
The candidate’s answer is very concise:
there are no unnecessary details, and it also

76
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,789
has a clear end.

77
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:03,400
What about our second question?

78
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,000
Here’s one possible answer:

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,260
There are many things I could be doing.

80
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,990
I’d like to have, you know, some sort of
progress…

81
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,330
What I mean is that I don’t just want to
be doing the same things I’m doing now.

82
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,090
I like to be moving forward in my career,
for example…

83
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,090
Err…

84
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:31,210
I definitely see myself in a better position
than I am now.

85
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,259
Good answer?

86
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,980
Bad answer?

87
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,780
Okay, it’s not terrible, but it could be
much better.

88
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:41,289
The candidate is rambling.

89
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:46,800
She doesn’t make her point clear, she doesn’t
speak in full sentences, and she wastes words

90
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,620
on unclear and unnecessary ideas.

91
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,880
Here’s a better answer:

92
00:06:52,889 --> 00:07:01,349
I don’t know exactly, but the most important
thing is that I continue to learn and grow

93
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:03,189
in my career.

94
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:10,090
I’m the kind of person who needs new challenges
to stay focused.

95
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:17,150
I might even start my own business, because
that’s something I’ve always wanted to

96
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:23,310
do at some point in my life.

97
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,810
This is much more concise.

98
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:33,599
The candidate’s answer has a clear beginning
and end, and doesn’t waste words.

99
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:40,599
So, what can you do to make your answers more
concise?

100
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:44,690
The best way to practise is to record yourself
speaking.

101
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,460
You could record yourself answering these
two questions.

102
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,439
Then, listen to yourself.

103
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:56,880
Try to find sentences which you don’t finish,
or words which don’t add anything to your

104
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,319
meaning.

105
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,310
Then, try again.

106
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,480
Keep practising until your answer is clean
and focused.

107
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:16,520
Next, let’s look at another point which
will make your answers clearer and more structured:

108
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,620
signposting language.

109
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:26,520
Signposting language means words and phrases
which show your listener where you’re going.

110
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,669
For example, the words ‘for example’ are
signposting language.

111
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:39,140
When I say for example, you know I’m about
to give you an example.

112
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,620
Simple, right?

113
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,940
Yes, but it’s also very important.

114
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:50,420
Without signposting language, longer answers
can lose focus and be hard to follow.

115
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,180
You’ll see answers to two questions in this
section:

116
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,290
What are your strengths and weaknesses?

117
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,660
What is your leadership style?

118
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,760
Let’s look at a sample answer to the first
question.

119
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,760
I’m very good at working with other people.

120
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:19,990
In my last job, I always tried to encourage
my colleagues and create a good atmosphere.

121
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,600
I suppose I can be a little bit careless sometimes.

122
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,540
I’m not the kind of person who focuses on
details.

123
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:37,420
I’m very calm, and I can keep a cool head in very stressful situations.

124
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,040
What do you think?

125
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,200
It’s not bad, but it could be hard to follow.

126
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,680
The candidate jumps around a lot.

127
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,089
Adding signposting language can make a big
difference.

128
00:09:52,089 --> 00:10:01,350
Let’s see how.
Notice that the content is exactly the same.

129
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,880
We haven’t changed the candidate’s basic
ideas at all.

130
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,760
However, the answer is now much clearer and
easier to follow.

131
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,940
Using signposting language like this can make
a big difference!

132
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,800
Let’s look at our second question for this
section.

133
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,699
What is your leadership style?

134
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:30,300
Look at a sample answer which doesn’t use
signposting language.

135
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,440
I’m quite a hands-off manager.

136
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,440
If one of my team has a project, I’ll keep
an eye on things, but I don’t need to be

137
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,620
involved in every detail.

138
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,080
I’m very approachable.

139
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,529
I make sure my team know they can come to
me with problems or questions at any time.

140
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:51,090
I like to lead from the front.

141
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:58,500
If everyone’s working late to meet a deadline,
I make sure I’m there with them.

142
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:06,280
Now, look at some signposting language you
could use in this answer.

143
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,060
Now, you have a job to do!

144
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:15,940
I want you to pause the video and put these
signposting phrases into the answer you just

145
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,220
saw.

146
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,380
Go on, pause the video and do it now!

147
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,660
Ready?

148
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:30,080
Let’s look at the answers:

149
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,560
How did you do?

150
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,640
Were you able to use the signposting language?

151
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:43,100
Remember, signposting language might seem
very simple, but don’t forget about it.

152
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:52,580
Using signposting language well makes your
answers much clearer and easier to follow.

153
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:57,959
Now, let’s look at another way to make
your answers more structured, clearer and

154
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,260
more focused.

155
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,100
You’ll see answers to these two questions
in this section.

156
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:11,100
Can you tell me about a time when you demonstrated
-----?

157
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:18,070
Tell me about a time you dealt with a challenging
situation at work.

158
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:23,820
These questions are likely to need longer
answers.

159
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,459
With longer answers, it’s really important
that your answers have a clear structure.

160
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,140
Otherwise, your meaning might get lost!

161
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:39,060
There’s a method you can use here; it’s
called the STAR method.

162
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:46,610
STAR means situation, task, action, result.

163
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:54,560
So, you start your answer by giving the context:
what was the situation, and what did you have

164
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,310
to do?

165
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:04,040
Then, you talk about what you actually did,
and what the end result was.

166
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,100
Let’s do an example together.

167
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:12,980
Can you tell me about a time when you demonstrated
excellent customer service?

168
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,380
Let’s use the STAR method.

169
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,699
There was one time when a customer’s order
hadn’t arrived, and we didn’t know what

170
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:23,910
had happened to it.

171
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:31,150
The customer was very unhappy, and I had to
try to solve the problem for him.

172
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:38,000
I arranged for a replacement to be sent, thinking
we could find out what happened to the previous

173
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,120
order later.

174
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:50,100
In the end, the customer was happy that I
could solve his problem quickly and simply.

175
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,400
You see how following this method lets you
build clear, structured answers?

176
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:04,220
situation,
task,

177
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:10,080
action,
result

178
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,780
Let’s do another example.

179
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,829
Think about our second question.

180
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:22,480
Tell me about a time you dealt with a challenging
situation at work.

181
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,920
This time, you’re going to try!

182
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,960
Pause the video and make an answer to this
question.

183
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,550
Your answer should be four sentences long.

184
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:39,580
Follow the STAR method, one sentence for each
part.

185
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,420
How was that?

186
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,279
Did you find it easy to make your own answer?

187
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:51,120
Let’s look at one way you could answer this
question.

188
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,300
Once, we realised three days before a project
deadline that two of our teams were using

189
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:59,360
incompatible software tools.

190
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:06,820
As the project manager, I had to find a way
to deal with this without causing any delays.

191
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,899
I talked to both team leaders and we made
a plan for one team to convert their work

192
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:18,130
into a different format, with help from some
staff from other departments.

193
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:25,940
It was very close but we managed to get everything
done on time.

194
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:31,560
Again, you can see the STAR method in action:

195
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:37,320
situation,
task,

196
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,460
action,
result.

197
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:49,790
If you combine this STAR method with the signposting
language you learned about in part two, you’ll

198
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:57,430
be able to express yourself clearly in English,
even in longer and more complex answers.

199
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:04,110
Finally, let’s look at another tip you can
use to impress your interviewer and increase

200
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,700
your chances of getting that job offer!

201
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,300
You’re going to learn about mirroring and
how it can help you.

202
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:18,579
What does mirroring mean?

203
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,700
It means using some of the same words and
expressions as the person you’re talking

204
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,940
to.

205
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:28,269
For example, if the interviewer asks you:

206
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:33,399
How do you think your values fit our company
culture?

207
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,430
You could start your answer by saying:

208
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:40,910
I think my values are a good fit for your
company culture for two reasons.

209
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,329
One…

210
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:44,529
Mirroring has several benefits.

211
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:48,600
First, it keeps your answers focused.

212
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,660
By using the same words and phrases, your
answer will be relevant.

213
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,709
More importantly, it shows the interviewer
that you’re listening and that you care

214
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:04,990
about the questions and the company.

215
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,949
Mirroring is powerful.

216
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:12,130
We unconsciously mirror people when we like
or respect them.

217
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,059
Using mirroring consciously will help you
to make a better impression.

218
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:23,039
You should start by researching the company
you’re applying to.

219
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,970
How do they describe themselves?

220
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:31,740
What adjectives do they use on their website
or in their advertising?

221
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,140
Also, read the job advertisement carefully.

222
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:41,390
Pay attention to the words they use to describe
the candidate they’re looking for.

223
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,220
Use these words in your answers.

224
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,270
Let’s think about this question:

225
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,740
Why do you want this job?

226
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:57,559
Imagine you’re applying to a company which
describes itself as ‘innovative’ and ‘forward-looking’.

227
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:04,180
In the job advertisement, they say they want
someone who is ‘creative’ and ‘flexible’.

228
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,640
Here’s a good sample answer:

229
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,840
Creativity is very important to me, and I’ve
always wanted to work in an environment where

230
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,400
I can innovate and find my own solutions to
challenges.

231
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,100
I also feel that your company will continue
to evolve in the future, and I like the idea

232
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:29,060
of contributing to that development.

233
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:36,340
The candidate doesn’t use all four words,
but she does reference all four ideas.

234
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:43,630
For example, instead of ‘forward-looking’,
she talks about the company evolving in the

235
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,700
future.

236
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,530
In this way, she shows that she’s in tune
with the company’s values.

237
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,420
Let’s do one more example.

238
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:57,460
Imagine you’re applying to a company which
describes itself as ‘commanding respect’

239
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,900
and which talks with pride about its long
history.

240
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:08,010
In the job advertisement, they say they want
someone who has ‘great communication skills’

241
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,270
and ‘passion for helping others’.

242
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,260
During the interview, they ask:

243
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,080
Why should we hire you?

244
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,020
Here’s a good sample answer, using mirroring.

245
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:28,059
I believe that great customer service starts
with good communication, which is a strength

246
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:29,059
of mine.

247
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:34,610
I also think that in customer service, you
need to care about what you’re doing.

248
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:41,640
I care about helping others and as such I
believe you would find me to be a respectful

249
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:49,520
and effective team member who can fit with
the established traditions of your company.

250
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,720
Again, the candidate doesn’t necessarily
use the words directly, but he does reference

251
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,020
all four of the ideas.

252
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:05,380
Be careful if you use mirroring; you don’t
want to sound like a robot!

253
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,919
This is why you sometimes need to change words
and phrases slightly, instead of repeating

254
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,100
them again and again.

255
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:22,100
Now, you’ve seen four effective techniques
you can use to give better answers to job

256
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,480
interview questions in English.

257
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:35,659
Remember: be concise, use signposting language,
use the STAR method to structure longer answers,

258
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:40,190
and mirror key words and phrases.

259
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,370
We hope it was useful.

260
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:46,370
Good luck if you have a job interview coming
up soon!

261
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,320
Thanks for watching!

262
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,230
See you next time!
