00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,350
Hello, I'm Oli.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,290
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,770
In this lesson, you can learn about how to
talk about your home in English.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,650
Where do you live?

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,580
What's your home like?

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,680
What about your neighbourhood?

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,270
Talking about where you live is a common conversation
topic in English.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,779
So it's good to have some things to say.

9
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:29,040
Part one: introducing where you live and talking
about types of home.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,210
Let's start with a simple sentence.

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:37,399
"I live in a..." what could you put there?

12
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,890
You could say, "I live in a house," "I live
in an apartment."

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,100
In Britain, people sometimes say, "Flat."

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,160
'Flat' and 'apartment' have the same meaning.

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,190
Next, let's add a bit more detail.

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,959
What kind of house or apartment is it?

17
00:00:55,959 --> 00:01:02,159
For example, "I live in a small, two-stoery
house in the suburbs."

18
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,580
When we say how many floors a building has,
we usually use the word storey, so you can

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:13,550
say a two-storey house, a four-storey apartment
building and so on.

20
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:19,520
"I live in an apartment on the third floor
of a four-storey building."

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,570
There are many different kinds of house and
apartment.

22
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:29,170
For example, do you live in a terraced house,
a semi-detached house, or a detached house?

23
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:35,060
Terraced houses have other houses on both
sides, a semi-detached house has another house

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:41,710
just on one side, and a detached house stands
by itself.

25
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,439
Detached houses are usually larger and more
expensive.

26
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,460
Terraced houses are usually smaller and cheaper.

27
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,189
What kinds of houses are more common in your
country?

28
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,130
What about apartments?

29
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,270
Many apartments are in apartment buildings.

30
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,840
Easy enough, right?

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,490
If you live in a very tall apartment building
with many floors, you can say you live in

32
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:13,850
a high-rise in American English or a tower
block in British English.

33
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:21,120
Sometimes a house is divided into apartments,
these are called converted apartments.

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,280
Apartments come in many different sizes, if
an apartment just has one room which is a

35
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,630
bedroom and living room together, it's called
a studio.

36
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:36,780
Of course, you can also have bigger apartments,
a two-bedroom apartment, a three-bedroom apartment

37
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,080
and so on.

38
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,280
Large apartments might be duplex apartments,
this means the apartment has more than one

39
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
floor.

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,510
What about you?

41
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,780
Where do you live?

42
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,360
Do you live in a house or an apartment?

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,319
Could you make a sentence using the vocabulary
from this section?

44
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,180
For example, "I live in a two-story terraced
house."

45
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,490
"I live in an apartment on the 28th floor
of a high-rise building."

46
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,849
"I live in a converted studio apartment."

47
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:17,060
Next, let's see how you can describe the inside
of your home in more detail.

48
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,329
If you want to describe your home, what can
you talk about?

49
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:24,500
Well, you could start by saying what rooms
it has.

50
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,799
For example, "My house has two bedrooms, a
kitchen, a living room, and a garden."

51
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,540
It's always better to add adjectives or details
to make your speaking more interesting.

52
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,840
Let's try: "My house has two small bedrooms,
a kitchen with a dining table, a living room

53
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,700
with big windows, and a small garden."

54
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,489
What other rooms might you have in your home?

55
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:53,409
You could have a dining room for people to
eat together.

56
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:59,860
Maybe you have an office or a study where
you can work, if you live in a warmer country,

57
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:06,400
you might have a balcony or a terrace where
you can sit outside in warmer weather.

58
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,720
What about your home?

59
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,129
What does it have?

60
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:14,409
Does your home have a garden, a balcony, or
another outdoor area?

61
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:17,739
Try to make a sentence describing your home.

62
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,480
For example, "I live in a two-bedroom apartment.

63
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,350
The bedrooms are quite small, but there's
a big living room with a dining area, a modern

64
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,580
kitchen, and also a small balcony where we
can sit outside in the summer."

65
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,680
What can you say about your home?

66
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay, next, saying what you like or dislike.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,060
So now you can hopefully describe your home
a little bit, but what about your opinion?

68
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,320
What do you like about your home, and what
would you change if you could?

69
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,540
Positive words you could use to describe your
home include 'spacious', meaning large with

70
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:04,570
lots of room; 'cosy' which means comfortable
in a warm welcoming way; 'light' describes

71
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,760
a home which gets lot of natural light.

72
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,950
You can say your home is 'warm' or 'cool',
meaning that it's comfortable in winter or

73
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,320
in summer.

74
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,560
Finally, you can describe your home as 'convenient',
meaning it's close to your job, it's close

75
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,570
to the shops, it's close to your children's
school and so on.

76
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,530
You can use 'convenient' plus 'for.'

77
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:36,280
For example, "it's convenient for the subway,"
or "it's convenient for my office."

78
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,010
Could you use any of these words to describe
your home?

79
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,330
Okay, but what if you don't like your home?

80
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:49,900
Well, here are some words you could use: 'cramped'
means your home is too small, so you don't

81
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,780
have enough space.

82
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,940
'Dark' means your home doesn't get enough
light, so that even when it's sunny outside,

83
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,670
it's still dark inside.

84
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:07,950
'Drafty' means cold air comes inside through
the windows or through the doors in the winter.

85
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:14,580
'Stuffy' means there's not enough air so it's
very uncomfortable in hot weather.

86
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,000
You could say your home is 'noisy', for example
if you live near a main road, your home might

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,760
be noisy even at night.

88
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,510
Can you make a sentence about your home using
some of these words?

89
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:33,710
For example, "My home is light and spacious,
but it can get very drafty in the winter."

90
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,880
"I like my apartment because it's cosy, although
it can be noisy because there's a restaurant

91
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
just downstairs."

92
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,460
Okay, so now you can talk about your home
and what you think of it.

93
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,300
What else can you say on this topic?

94
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,680
Let's look, part four: saying who you live
with.

95
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,190
Who do you live with?

96
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,440
Do live with your parents, your husband or
wife, with your family?

97
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:05,040
Do you live by yourself or do you live with
flatmates (people who you share a rented flat

98
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,490
with)?

99
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,180
Maybe you live with friends.

100
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,470
Let's look at examples of what you could say
here.

101
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,190
"I live with my parents."

102
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,690
"I live in a shared house; I have four flatmates."

103
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,990
"I live by myself."

104
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,560
What about you?

105
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,300
Okay, that was easy.

106
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,870
Let's look at one more topic you can talk
about.

107
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,150
Part five: talking about your neighbourhood.

108
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,770
First, be careful with the word 'neighbourhood'.

109
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:42,080
A neighbourhood is not a person; it's the
area near your home.

110
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,810
So where is your home?

111
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:49,160
Is it in the city centre, the suburbs, or
outside the city?

112
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,410
If you live outside the city, do you live
on the outskirts of the city, in a village,

113
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,330
or in the middle of nowhere?

114
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,570
How could you describe your neighbourhood?

115
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,080
Is it quiet or lively?

116
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,090
Trendy or boring?

117
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,770
Are there many shops, cafes, bars, restaurants?

118
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,820
Are there parks or sports facilities?

119
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:18,620
For example, you could say, "I live in a very
lively area just south of the city center.

120
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,550
There are many cafes, shops, and places to
go."

121
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:28,360
Or, "I live in a quiet area in the suburbs,
in the north of the city.

122
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,640
It's a nice area and it's quiet, but it's
a bit boring.

123
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,009
There isn't really anything to do."

124
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:36,289
What about you?

125
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:39,069
Can you say something about your neighborhood?

126
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:43,010
Okay, finally let's put everything together.

127
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:48,250
If you can use everything we've looked at
in this lesson, you should be able to speak

128
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:54,209
very clearly and with lots of details about
your home and where you live.

129
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:58,440
For example, "I live in a two-story terraced
house.

130
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,010
It has two bedrooms, a living room, a small
kitchen, and a garden.

131
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:08,620
It's cosy and convenient for getting to work,
but it's a bit cramped, especially when we

132
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,190
have guests.

133
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,040
I live with my wife and daughter.

134
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,519
Our house is near the city centre in a quiet
neighborhood.

135
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,860
There isn't much to do, but there are some
small shops and a park where we go if the

136
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,540
weather's nice."

137
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:30,110
Here's one more sample answer: "I live by
myself in a studio apartment.

138
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,720
It just has one main room with a tiny kitchen.

139
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,589
It's very warm in winter, but it can get a
bit stuffy in summer.

140
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:41,600
I live in the city center, very close to everything.

141
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,240
It's very lively, with lots of bars and restaurants.

142
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,720
It's a good place for young people to live,
but not many families choose to live here."

143
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,800
What about you?

144
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,459
Can you make an answer like this talking about
where you live?

145
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:59,110
Try to use as much language from the lesson
as you can.

146
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,050
Okay, that's the end of the lesson.

147
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,480
Thanks very much for watching.

148
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,630
You can see more of our free English lessons
on our website, oxfordonlineenglish.com, but

149
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,630
that's all.

150
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,630
Thanks again.

151
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,630
I'll see you next time.

152
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,639
Bye-bye!
