00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,860
Hi, I’m Justin.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,710
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,920
In this lesson, you can see what you need
to do to get band seven in the IELTS speaking

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,430
exam.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:18,560
To get band seven in the IELTS speaking exam,
you need to speak at a high level.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,240
There’s no other way; no one gets band seven
for IELTS without speaking really good English.

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,410
However, you also need to know how the exam
works, how the scoring works, and how to prepare

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,900
for your IELTS speaking test.

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,550
In this video, you’ll see exactly what to
do to get band seven in the four parts of

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,510
your IELTS speaking score.

11
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,140
You’ll also see some common problems that
IELTS candidates have, and we’ll share some

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,829
practical exercises to help you prepare for
your speaking exam and improve your IELTS

13
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,380
speaking score!

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,280
But first, I just mentioned “the four parts
of your IELTS speaking score.”

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,649
Do you know what those are?

16
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,140
Your final IELTS speaking score is actually
an average of four different scores.

17
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,330
First is fluency and coherence.

18
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,970
This means whether you can speak without pausing
or hesitating, and whether you can answer

19
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,600
questions fully and directly.

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,670
Next is lexical resource.

21
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,799
This basically means ‘vocabulary’.

22
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,850
This score focuses on your ability to use
a wide range of vocabulary accurately.

23
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,460
Third is grammatical range and accuracy.

24
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,750
To get a high score here, you need to use
a wide range of grammar structures without

25
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,520
making mistakes.

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,200
Finally, you get a score for pronunciation.

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,400
This depends both on how clear your pronunciation
is, and whether you use features of native

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,760
speech, like natural intonation.

29
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,340
We’ll look at these four scores in more
detail during this class.

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,979
If you want to read the scoring system, you
can, and you should!

31
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,340
There’s a link underneath the video.

32
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,240
Let’s start with your fluency and coherence
score, and what you can do to improve it.

33
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,139
To get band seven in your fluency and coherence
score, you need to speak without hesitating

34
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:18,950
much, stay on topic, and use linking words
well.

35
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,719
It’s okay to hesitate occasionally, for
example because you need one or two seconds

36
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,650
to remember a word.

37
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,870
However, if you hesitate often, then getting
band seven is difficult.

38
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:36,580
‘Linking words’ here includes very simple
connectors, like and, but or for example.

39
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,999
You don’t need to use formal or academic
language in your IELTS speaking test.

40
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:44,340
In fact, it could even hurt your score.

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,819
So, what should you do?

42
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,939
First, identify your biggest weaknesses.

43
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:55,209
Here are some common problems which could
stop you getting band seven:

44
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:02,800
You pause and hesitate a lot when you speak
You give short answers.

45
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,189
You go off-topic.

46
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:12,249
You speak in short, simple sentences, without
using linking words.

47
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:15,719
What do you think; what’s your number one
problem?

48
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:18,939
It’s important to choose one.

49
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:23,510
To improve, it’s better to focus on one
thing at a time.

50
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,510
Got an idea?

51
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,079
So, here’s what you do.

52
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,320
Choose a common IELTS speaking topic.

53
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,980
Choose one topic and record yourself talking
about it for one minute.

54
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,069
Listen to the recording.

55
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:37,419
Next, check for problems.

56
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:42,590
For example, if you said your biggest weakness
is hesitating and pausing, then listen to

57
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,489
your recording and count the number of times
you pause.

58
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:51,870
Count every time you stop, every time you
say ‘um’, ‘er’ or something like that.

59
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,629
Then, repeat the task, and try to improve.

60
00:03:55,629 --> 00:04:01,079
For example, if you’re working on hesitations
and pauses, then try to get fewer hesitations

61
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,900
and pauses the second time.

62
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,280
If you’re working on giving longer answers,
then try to get closer to one minute.

63
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,909
After you improve your answer, set yourself
a new challenge.

64
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:18,420
For example, you can choose a different topic,
or you can try to talk for longer.

65
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,190
Try to talk for two minutes without hesitating,
or three.

66
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,470
You might need some help here.

67
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:29,740
For example, students who go off topic generally
don’t realise they’re going off topic;

68
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,620
that’s part of the problem.

69
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,560
In this case, you might need feedback from
a friend or a teacher.

70
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,100
Use of linking words is more difficult to
practice by yourself, but here’s a simple

71
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:48,440
exercise you can do: write down a list of
simple linking words, like this:

72
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,820
Do the same activity: choose a topic and speak
for one minute.

73
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,730
Try to use all of the linking words on your
list.

74
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,790
Listen to your recording, and cross off the
linking words when you use them.

75
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,850
If you don’t use them all, try again.

76
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,790
If you can use them all, make the task more
difficult: make your list longer, and try

77
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,890
to speak for more time.

78
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:17,500
Practice regularly with different topics,
and your fluency should improve.

79
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,750
Next, what about your vocabulary score?

80
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:29,840
To get band seven for your vocabulary score
in your IELTS speaking test, you need to:

81
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,320
use vocabulary to talk about different topics,
use some less common vocabulary, use collocations,

82
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,600
use register appropriately, and use paraphrase.

83
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,010
Let’s see what these things mean!

84
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,920
‘Collocations’ are word combinations.

85
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,800
For example, think about the word complex.

86
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,430
What things can be complex?

87
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:02,170
You could have a complex situation, a complex
question, a complex personality, or a complex

88
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,670
idea.

89
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,180
There are others, but that’s not the point.

90
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:12,270
It’s not enough to know a word, like complex,
you also need to know how to combine the words

91
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,620
you know.

92
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,050
‘Register’ means whether the language
you use is formal or informal.

93
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,990
In the IELTS speaking test, the most common
mistake is trying to speak much too formally.

94
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,430
If you use words in an unnatural way, it will
hurt your score.

95
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,520
Your goal is to communicate clearly and naturally,
not formally.

96
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,060
Finally, ‘paraphrase’ means using a range
of language to avoid repetition.

97
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,280
Let’s look at an example.

98
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,260
The examiner asks: Tell me about your free
time.

99
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,540
You say:

100
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,610
In my free time, I enjoy reading books.

101
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,600
Whenever I have free time, I like to read
different kinds of books, especially historical

102
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,410
fiction or fantasy.

103
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:05,780
I usually have free time at the weekends,
so I read books as much as I can.

104
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,120
In many ways, this is a good answer.

105
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,740
However, there’s a problem; can you see
it?

106
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,250
It’s too repetitive.

107
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,830
The candidate uses the words free time and
read books too much.

108
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,590
Paraphrase means that you use different language
to avoid this.

109
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,830
For example:

110
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,120
In my free time, I enjoy reading books.

111
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,870
Whenever I have some time to myself, I like
to sit down with a good book, especially historical

112
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,640
fiction or fantasy.

113
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:41,060
I don’t have to work at the weekends, which
lets me read as much as I want.

114
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,110
This answer has the same ideas as the first
answer you saw, but it uses a wider range

115
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,650
of language to avoid repetition.

116
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,010
So, now you know what you need to do to get
band seven for vocabulary.

117
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,250
But, how can you improve?

118
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,120
First, focus on collocations.

119
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,050
Most IELTS students who we meet have enough
vocabulary to get band seven, but they can’t

120
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,780
combine the words they know correctly.

121
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,680
Here’s an exercise: read something in English
every day.

122
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,160
It can be anything: a news article, a blog
post, part of a story…

123
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,080
Anything is fine.

124
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,710
In the text, try to find 5-10 new collocations
using only words you already know.

125
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:32,130
The idea is not to learn new words; instead,
your goal is to find new ways to use your

126
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,560
existing vocabulary.

127
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,469
You can also use a dictionary to find new
collocations.

128
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:43,539
For example, imagine that you’re reading
a news article and you see the phrase energy

129
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,940
use.

130
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,560
You already know the words energy and use,
so you learn this collocation.

131
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,490
Next, look up the word energy in the dictionary,
and find 2-3 more collocations, like:

132
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,910
energy consumption
green energy

133
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,430
conserve energy

134
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,149
Keep track of your new collocations using
digital flashcard apps like Quizlet or Anki.

135
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:14,529
By improving your knowledge of collocations,
you’ll be able to use a wider range of vocabulary

136
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:20,000
in your IELTS speaking exam, and this will
also help you to paraphrase.

137
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,120
It’s also important to read and listen in
English regularly to build your vocabulary,

138
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,970
although this is a long process.

139
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,640
Next, what about your grammar score?

140
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,060
To get band seven for grammar, you need to
do two things.

141
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,550
One: you need to use a range of ‘complex
grammatical structures’.

142
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,370
Two: you need to make ‘frequent error-free
sentences’.

143
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:54,019
‘Complex structures’ here does not mean
that you need to use very formal or academic

144
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:56,790
language, as we mentioned before.

145
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:02,819
It means that you need to use different verb
tenses, sentence structures, conjunctions

146
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:04,750
and so on.

147
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,639
For example, imagine the examiner asks you:

148
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,310
What kind of food do you prefer?

149
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,310
You answer:

150
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,720
I prefer Asian food.

151
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,410
I like strong flavours and spicy food, so
I particularly like Thai food, Indian food,

152
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,540
and so on.

153
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,899
I’m quite keen on Japanese food as well.

154
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,759
I think Indian food is probably my favourite.

155
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,579
This is a good answer in many ways, but it
does not have enough grammatical range to

156
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:34,680
get band seven.

157
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,449
Can you see why?

158
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:42,020
There are four sentences all starting with
the same word: I.

159
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,120
All of the verbs are in the present tense.

160
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:50,050
Also, only one sentence has a conjunction.

161
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:55,170
To get a higher score, you need to use a wider
range of grammar, like this:

162
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,779
I prefer Asian food, such as Thai, Indian,
and so on, because I’ve always been a big

163
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,529
fan of spicy food with strong flavours.

164
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:09,070
I tried Japanese food a few weeks ago, and
I like it, although I’d say that Indian

165
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,740
food is probably my favourite.

166
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,860
Think about two things here.

167
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,889
One: the meaning is the same.

168
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:19,129
You’re expressing the same ideas.

169
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:24,980
Two: you’re not using very complicated or
formal language.

170
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,529
What changed?

171
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:33,059
We combined the four sentences into two, using
words like because and although.

172
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,249
This will also help your fluency and coherence
score!

173
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:42,999
We’ve also used a wider range of verb forms,
such as the present perfect,

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,900
the past simple,
or the modal verb would

175
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:54,230
However, for most IELTS candidates, accuracy
is more important for band seven.

176
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:59,720
Remember that for band seven, you have to
produce ‘frequent error-free sentences’.

177
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,269
Think about the words ‘error-free’.

178
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:04,529
That means no mistakes.

179
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:10,850
No mistakes with prepositions, no mistakes
with the, no mistakes with verb tenses; no

180
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,220
mistakes at all, even small ones.

181
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,190
If you’ve been studying English for a long
time, you probably have some bad habits.

182
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,629
For example:

183
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:26,380
You forget the ‘s’ on 3rd person verbs,
so you say ‘she go’ instead of ‘she

184
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,040
goes’.

185
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,499
You forget to use past forms, so you use present
verbs to talk about the past.

186
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:40,819
You make mistakes with prepositions, like
using at, in or on to talk about time.

187
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:46,750
You use will to talk about everything in the
future, instead of using going to or the present

188
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,089
continuous when you need to.

189
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:54,399
These are some of the most common examples,
but there are more!

190
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,250
The point is: you probably make more mistakes
than you realise.

191
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,560
To get band seven for IELTS speaking, you
need to get rid of these bad habits.

192
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,320
So, what should you do?

193
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,589
First, identify five common mistakes which
you make.

194
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:14,550
If you don’t know, you might need to ask
a teacher for feedback.

195
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:20,329
Next, choose one mistake to work on, then
choose a topic and record yourself speaking,

196
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:22,089
like you did before.

197
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:24,959
Choose a topic which fits the grammar you’re
practicing.

198
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:31,949
For example, if you forget to use past tenses,
choose a topic which is about the past.

199
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:34,839
Listen to the recording and count the mistakes
you make.

200
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:39,910
Only focus on one grammar mistake at one time.

201
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,670
Repeat until you can speak for one minute
without mistakes.

202
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,529
Then, try again with a different mistake,
or a different topic.

203
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:53,959
In this way, you can learn to speak more accurately,
and get a better IELTS speaking score for

204
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:54,959
your grammar.

205
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,220
Finally, what about pronunciation?

206
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,410
To get band seven for pronunciation, you need
to be easy to understand and use ‘features

207
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,120
of natural speech’.

208
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,199
What does that mean?

209
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,509
For IELTS, this mostly means: intonation,
weak forms, word stress, sentence stress,

210
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:19,279
and linking.

211
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,269
An important point: your accent does not matter
for your IELTS score, so long as you’re

212
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:26,269
easy to understand.

213
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:31,709
You don’t have to speak with a British accent
or an American accent.

214
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:34,290
Pronunciation is hard to improve by yourself.

215
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,730
You need feedback from a professional teacher
to work on pronunciation.

216
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,769
However, there are some things you can do
in your own time.

217
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:47,480
First, think about the list of pronunciation
features we mentioned:

218
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,689
intonation
weak forms

219
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,020
word stress
sentence stress

220
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,819
and linking

221
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:55,230
Do you know what these are?

222
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,720
If not, find out!

223
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,449
There are many resources online to help you.

224
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:05,309
You can also find many free videos on our
website and our channel which can help you

225
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:07,730
to practice these pronunciation points.

226
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:13,040
Next, choose the point you find most difficult,
and work on that with your teacher.

227
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,959
If you can only study by yourself, this will
be difficult.

228
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:21,019
But, here are some tips that could help you:
Find English songs, and sing along to them

229
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:23,170
with the lyrics.

230
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,059
Find videos or recordings of famous speeches,
and try to copy them.

231
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,379
This is very good for your intonation and
stress.

232
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:37,499
Find audio sources in English—podcasts,
radio shows, YouTube videos—anything will

233
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:38,499
do!

234
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:42,110
Try to copy what you hear with the same accent.

235
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,050
This isn’t because accent matters, but when
you copy the accent, you’ll hopefully copy

236
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,869
a lot of the natural features as well.

237
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:54,360
Also, you should make sure you’re pronouncing
all English sounds correctly.

238
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:02,589
For example, can you pronounce ‘th’ sounds,
or do you change it to a /d/ or a /z/ sound?

239
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:07,610
Like everything else, you should first identify
which sounds you have problems with.

240
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,509
Practice the sounds with your teacher.

241
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:13,399
Ask your teacher to correct you every time
you make a mistake.

242
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,340
This way, you’ll improve quickly.

243
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,439
Getting band seven in IELTS speaking is not
easy!

244
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:25,059
Expect that you’ll need to spend a lot of
time and effort to get there.

245
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:27,290
Good luck with your IELTS tests!

246
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,019
If you already got band seven: how did you
do it?

247
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,019
Do you have any advice to share?

248
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:33,809
