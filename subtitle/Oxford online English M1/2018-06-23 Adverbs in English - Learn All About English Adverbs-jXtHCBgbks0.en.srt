00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,020
Hi, I’m Stephanie.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,279
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,660
In this lesson, you can learn about adverbs.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,990
What do adverbs do?

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,440
What’s the difference between adjectives
and adverbs?

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,170
How do you use adverbs in English?

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,210
You can learn the answers to these questions
in this lesson.

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,680
Let’s start with a challenge.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,230
Can you write down five English adverbs?

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,850
Pause the video and do it now.

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,940
Ready?

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,810
I’m guessing you wrote down words ending
with -ly.

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,300
For example:

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,410
quickly
slowly

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,790
Or: clearly

16
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,460
These are all adverbs.

17
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,630
However, there are many other adverbs.

18
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,210
Many of them don’t end with -ly, like these:

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,210
fast
too

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,170
Or: often

21
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,260
Many adverbs aren’t just one word.

22
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,329
Adverbs can be two words, or even whole phrases.

23
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,530
For example:

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,880
last week
in a very strange way

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,450
for the last six years

26
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,880
So you might be thinking: what do adverbs
actually do?

27
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,930
What are adverbs?

28
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,900
Adverbs are describing words.

29
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,229
They add information to something else in
your sentence.

30
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,270
Adverbs can describe many different things.

31
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,979
You can use an adverb to describe a verb,
like this:

32
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,310
He speaks very loudly.

33
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,040
Does everyone drive that fast in this city?

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,579
I think I sound better than I did the first
time.

35
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:50,400
The adverbs
add information to the verbs

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,390
These adverbs all describe the verbs by saying
how someone did something.

37
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:02,750
For example, look at the first sentence: he
speaks very loudly.

38
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,540
The adverb loudly tells you how he speaks.

39
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,059
You can also use adverbs to add information
to verbs in other ways.

40
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:14,059
For example:

41
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:18,470
I kind of enjoyed it, but it could have been
better.

42
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,189
We talked a little, but we didn’t have time
to discuss everything.

43
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:24,189
What else?

44
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:31,590
Well, you can use an adverb to show when,
where, or how often something happens.

45
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,590
For example:

46
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,189
Let’s meet at eight o’clock.

47
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:38,349
She moved overseas after she graduated.

48
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:43,120
I don’t often have time to cook for myself.

49
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,879
Remember that adverbs can be phrases; adverbs
aren’t always single words.

50
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:56,430
Another point: adverbs can add information
to adjectives, or even to other adverbs!

51
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,989
How does this work?

52
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,010
Can you think of any examples of this?

53
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,170
Here are some examples:

54
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,599
It was a really exciting trip.

55
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,669
It’s too hot in here.

56
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:12,069
She works incredibly hard.

57
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:16,599
You can see two examples where an adverb describes
an adjective…

58
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,379
…and one example where an adverb describes
another adverb.

59
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:29,450
Remember that hard here is an adverb, because
it describes a verb, works.

60
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,049
Is that everything?

61
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:33,269
No, not quite!

62
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:35,670
Adverbs can do one more thing.

63
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,919
Adverbs can also express your opinion about
a situation.

64
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,790
Look at three sentences:

65
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,930
She’s obviously the best of the candidates
we’ve seen so far.

66
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,889
Apparently, they’re not sure they want to
get married any more.

67
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:57,079
Fortunately, we were able to recover most
of the files.

68
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,529
These adverbs are different because they don’t
just add information to one word; they add

69
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:05,109
information to the whole sentence.

70
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:10,150
So, you can see that adverbs can do many,
many different things.

71
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:16,760
They can describe verbs, adjectives, other
adverbs, or even whole sentences.

72
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,769
But, there’s a connection.

73
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,580
Do you remember what we said at the start
of this section?

74
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,530
Adverbs describe other things.

75
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,979
They add information to something else in
your sentence.

76
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:37,900
Now, let’s look at our next question: how
do you form adverbs?

77
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,880
Actually, this question isn’t always relevant.

78
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:45,240
For most English adverbs, you don’t need
to ‘form’ them.

79
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,360
They just exist!

80
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,680
For example: too, very, sometimes, always,
here and soon are all adverbs, and you don’t

81
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,370
need to do anything to them.

82
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,440
So, why ask the question at all?

83
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,520
For some adverbs, you can form them from adjectives.

84
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,750
This is mostly true for adverbs which describe
verbs: adverbs which describe how someone

85
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,270
does something.

86
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,840
For example, slow is an adjective.

87
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,380
How can you make an adverb from it?

88
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,340
Look at a sentence and complete the missing
word:

89
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,250
He eats very s________.

90
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,680
Do you know the answer?

91
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
The answer is slowly.

92
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,180
You add -ly to the adjective to make an adverb.

93
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,220
This is the same for many adverbs which describe
verbs.

94
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,539
For example:

95
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:46,069
quiet → quietly
nice → nicely

96
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:49,080
clear → clearly

97
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,870
Can you use these adverbs in a sentence?

98
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:58,310
Pause the video and write down three sentences
using these adverbs.

99
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,419
Of course, there are many possibilities!

100
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:03,539
Here are some suggestions:

101
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:07,990
Everyone was sitting quietly and reading.

102
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,979
He sings very nicely.

103
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,669
You clearly told me that you would be here
at ten thirty.

104
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:20,139
However, even here, you can’t just think
‘add -ly to an adjective’.

105
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:22,349
It doesn’t always work!

106
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:30,349
First, if an adjective ends with -y, you need
to change -y to -ily to make an adverb.

107
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,639
For example:

108
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,639
healthy → healthily
lazy → lazily

109
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,500
happy → happily

110
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,710
Secondly, some words don’t change their
form.

111
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,050
The same word can be either an adjective or
an adverb.

112
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,259
For example:

113
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,749
He’s a really fast worker.

114
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:54,300
He works really fast.

115
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,139
You’re a better dancer than you used to
be.

116
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:03,659
You dance better than you used to.

117
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:10,540
Fast and better can be used as adjectives
or adverbs, and the form of the word doesn’t

118
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,689
change.

119
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:19,900
Thirdly, some adjectives already end in -ly
like ugly, friendly, likely or oily.

120
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,219
These adjectives can’t be made into adverbs.

121
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:26,199
Finally, some adverbs are irregular.

122
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:33,360
Words which don’t change, like fast or better,
are examples of irregular adverbs.

123
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,930
There’s one more important one: what’s
the adverb from the adjective good?

124
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,090
The answer is well.

125
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,110
For example:

126
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,080
She’s a good writer.

127
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,270
She writes well.

128
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,840
Now, you know how to form adverbs from adjectives.

129
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,620
Remember that you don’t need to ‘form’
most adverbs.

130
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,610
Most adverbs are ready for you to use, and
you don’t have to do anything to them!

131
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:09,990
So, now seems like a good time to ask a new
question: what’s the difference between

132
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,340
adjectives and adverbs?

133
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:21,719
Hopefully, you have enough information from
parts one and two to answer this question.

134
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:24,599
Do you know the answer?

135
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:29,360
Adjectives and adverbs both describe other
words.

136
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,560
Adjectives describe nouns.

137
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,650
For example:

138
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,849
Are you a good cook?

139
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,620
He has a loud voice.

140
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,729
My computer is so slow!

141
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:49,130
Adverbs describe everything else: verbs, adjectives,
adverbs and whole sentences.

142
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,790
That sounds easy, right?

143
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,889
So, let’s test your skills!

144
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:55,630
Look at four sentences.

145
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,860
Is the word in red an adjective or an adverb?

146
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,290
It’s unlikely that we’ll be there on time.

147
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:11,389
I found the exam really hard.

148
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:15,870
I worked really hard preparing for the exam.

149
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,990
He hardly studied at all, but he got a high
score!

150
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,110
What do you think?

151
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,440
Pause the video if you want more time to think
about it.

152
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,130
Unlikely and hard are adjectives.

153
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,810
Hard and hardly are adverbs.

154
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,930
Did you get the right answers?

155
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,310
There are two things to pay attention to here.

156
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:50,320
One: the form of the word doesn’t tell you
if it’s an adjective or an adverb.

157
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,740
Unlikely ends in -ly, but it’s not an adverb;
it’s an adjective.

158
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,310
Hard in the third sentence doesn’t end in
-ly, but it’s an adverb which describes

159
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,180
a verb.

160
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:10,000
Two: the same word can be an adjective or
an adverb in different sentences, like hard,

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,180
which is an adjective in the second sentence,
but an adverb in the third sentence.

162
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,649
So, what can you do here?

163
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:20,860
You can’t depend on memory.

164
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,470
If you think something like, ‘Hard is an
adjective’, that won’t work all the time.

165
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:32,110
Don’t look at the form of the word; look
at what the word does in the sentence.

166
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,830
Does the word describe a noun?

167
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,300
It’s an adjective.

168
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:44,600
Does it describe something else: a verb, an
adjective, another adverb, or the whole sentence?

169
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,339
It’s an adverb.

170
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:53,839
Next, let’s look at one more important question:
how do you use adverbs in a sentence?

171
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,920
More specifically: where should you put the
adverb?

172
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,200
Let’s start with a simple point: word order
rules for adverbs in English are complicated.

173
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:12,550
There are many rules, and as usual the rules
don’t work all of the time.

174
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:19,150
So, if you want to use an adverb and you’re
not sure where it should go in the sentence,

175
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,070
trust your instinct first.

176
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,430
If it sounds right, it probably is.

177
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:29,720
If you want to understand word order rules
in depth, you need to divide adverbs into

178
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,200
five different categories.

179
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,529
You already saw these categories in part one,
although we didn’t give them names.

180
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:40,060
Let’s review now!

181
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,700
Adverbs of manner describe a verb.

182
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,690
They describe how someone does something.

183
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,300
For example: fast, lazily, or well.

184
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,300
Adverbs of time and place describe where or
when something happens.

185
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:03,079
For example: yesterday, here, or in five minutes.

186
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:06,899
Adverbs of frequency describe how often something
happens.

187
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:12,480
For example: often, sometimes, or never.

188
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,459
Adverbs of degree mostly add information to
other adjectives or adverbs.

189
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:24,970
For example: very, too, or a little.

190
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:30,160
Comment adverbs describe a whole sentence
or situation.

191
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,740
For example: unfortunately, basically, or
obviously.

192
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,000
Here you have five different categories of
adverb.

193
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,240
Mostly, where you put the adverb depends on
the type of adverb it is.

194
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,000
So, for example, comment adverbs follow different
rules to adverbs of manner.

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
‘Mostly’?

196
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,310
Why ‘mostly’?

197
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,430
Of course, there are exceptions!

198
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,670
Remember, trust your instinct when you can.

199
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:02,860
Now, let’s look at how to use these different
types of adverb in an English sentence.

200
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,300
Adverbs of manner go after the verb or verb
phrase which they describe.

201
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,390
For example:

202
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,780
He drives slowly.

203
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,010
She sings well.

204
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:20,620
Here, you have very simple examples: a verb
followed by an adverb.

205
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,500
Remember that adverbs of manner can also follow
a verb phrase.

206
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,630
For example:

207
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:32,950
She didn’t handle the situation well.

208
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:39,899
Adverbs of time and place usually go at the
end of the sentence or phrase, like this:

209
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,730
Let’s leave in half an hour.

210
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,920
Is there a bank nearby?

211
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,389
If you have both, then adverbs of place go
before adverbs of time:

212
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:54,220
She was here ten minutes ago.

213
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,190
Adverbs of frequency usually go before the
main verb.

214
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,769
For example:

215
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:03,190
I usually get up early.

216
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,699
They hardly ever talk to each other.

217
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:14,690
There’s one important exception here: if
the main verb is be, adverbs of frequency

218
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,420
go after it:

219
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,339
He isn’t often so talkative.

220
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:24,500
Adverbs of degree go before the word they
describe:

221
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,670
It’s absolutely freezing in here!

222
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,950
She took the news very calmly.

223
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,110
Comment adverbs usually go at the beginning
of the sentence:

224
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,920
Basically, you’ve got two options.

225
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,060
Eventually, we had to admit that things weren’t
going how we expected.

226
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,870
That’s a lot of rules!

227
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,660
It’s good to have an idea of the rules,
or know where to find them in case you want

228
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,240
to look something up.

229
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,840
However, you don’t need to carry all of
these in your head all the time.

230
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,769
Remember that you can (and should) use your
instinct.

231
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:09,040
Finally, here are two important points which
you can carry in your head and which you should

232
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,060
remember:

233
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:17,850
One: if the verb has two parts, most adverbs
will go in the middle, before the main verb.

234
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,160
Try it: look at five sentences, and put the
adverb in the right place.

235
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,959
Pause the video, and start again when you
think you have the answers.

236
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,259
Ready?

237
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:30,990
Let’s look at the answers:

238
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,190
1.

239
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,379
They didn’t even tell us they’d be late.

240
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:36,379
2.

241
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:38,339
I’ve just spoken to her.

242
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:39,339
3.

243
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:43,670
He’s quickly becoming one of our most valuable
team members.

244
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,670
4.

245
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,199
I can probably do it by next Wednesday.

246
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:49,199
5.

247
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,529
She hasn’t always been like that.

248
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:54,529
Did you get them all right?

249
00:15:54,529 --> 00:16:00,540
This is a useful rule, and many of the mistakes
that English learners make with adverb word

250
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,069
order are related to this rule, so remember
it!

251
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:07,699
We said before that there are two important
points.

252
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:09,199
What’s the second?

253
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,699
There can be more than one possible position
for an adverb.

254
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:14,899
For example:

255
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:17,839
He can be very moody sometimes.

256
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,500
Sometimes, he can be very moody.

257
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,600
Both of these are possible.

258
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,660
The first is more common, but the second is
also correct, and you might use this if you

259
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,310
want to emphasise the word sometimes.

260
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:39,830
So, if you have two choices, and you aren’t
sure which is right, maybe they both are!

261
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,550
Hopefully this lesson has helped you to understand
English adverbs and how to use them.
