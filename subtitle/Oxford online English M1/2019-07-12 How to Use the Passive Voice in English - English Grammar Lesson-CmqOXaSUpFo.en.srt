00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,250
Hi, I’m Olivier.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,840
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,630
In this lesson, you can learn about the passive
voice in English.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,710
You can see what it is, how to form it, and
how to use it.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:21,140
Before we start, don’t forget to check out
our website: Oxford Online English dot com.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,000
You can find many other free English lessons. You can

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,340
also take online classes with one of our
qualified teachers.

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,029
But now, let’s start with the basics.

9
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:34,570
What is the passive voice?

10
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:40,960
Look at these sentences: ‘This dish is made
with eggs and cheese.’

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,220
‘The car was badly damaged in the accident.’

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,200
‘Their house looks like it hasn’t been
cleaned for months.’

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,460
All of these examples use the passive voice.

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,480
Can you see how and why?

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,620
Let’s look.

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,140
In a regular, active sentence, you start with
a subject, then you add a verb, which often

17
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,680
has an object.

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,840
For example: ‘A dog bit me when I was five.’

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,130
Can you find the subject, verb and object
in this sentence?

20
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,200
To make the sentence passive, the subject
and object change places: ‘I was bitten

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,799
by a dog when I was five.’

22
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,000
When you make a sentence passive, you only
change the subject, verb and object.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,020
Everything else stays the same.

24
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,640
In this example, ‘when I was five’ isn’t
part of the subject-verb-object structure,

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,600
so it’s the same whether the sentence is
active or passive.

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,900
Next, let’s see how to form the passive
voice.

27
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,740
Look at three sentences from the start of
the lesson again.

28
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,960
They look different, but they all contain
the passive.

29
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,640
What do the sentences have in common?

30
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,520
All three sentences contain the verb ‘be’
and a past participle—also called the 3rd

31
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,480
form.

32
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,320
This is what you need to form passive sentences.

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,690
Let’s do some practice!

34
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,240
Can you add the missing verbs to these three
sentences?

35
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,860
If you’re not sure, remember the rule from
before: you need ‘be’ plus a past participle.

36
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:38,069
Here, you need to put the verbs into the past
participle form.

37
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:41,980
Pause the video and think about your answers.

38
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,700
Ready?

39
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,640
Here are the full sentences.

40
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,240
Here’s a question: these sentences contain
the verb ‘be’, but it’s different in

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,709
each sentence.

42
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,480
Do you know why?

43
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,120
Let’s look together!

44
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:09,610
What do you do if you want to make a passive
sentence past, or future, or present perfect?

45
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,360
What changes?

46
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,060
Look at our last three examples again.

47
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,720
Remember that the passive is made of two parts:
‘be’ plus a past participle.

48
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,420
What changes, and what stays the same?

49
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:30,110
The answer: you can change the verb ‘be’
to use different tenses and times.

50
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:35,840
The past participle *never changes.* Whether
you’re talking about the past, the present,

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,040
or the future, the past participle stays the
same.

52
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,690
Let’s see how this works:

53
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:48,220
Past: ‘The letters were sent to all our
customers last week.’

54
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,980
Present: ‘The letters are sent to all our
customers every week.’

55
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:59,840
Present perfect: ‘The letters have been
sent to all our customers this week.’

56
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:07,290
Future with ‘will’: ‘The letters will
be sent to all our customers next week.’

57
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,349
Of course, there are other possible forms,
but the idea is the same.

58
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:18,650
There are also passive infinitives with ‘to’:
‘The letters need to be sent to all our

59
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,940
customers.’

60
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:28,150
And, there are passive –ing forms: ‘Many
customers like being sent regular newsletters.’

61
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:34,590
You can see the same pattern every time: ‘be’
plus a past participle, and the verb ‘be’

62
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,490
can change to show different times or forms.

63
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,660
The past participle never changes, in any
form of the passive!

64
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,740
Let’s do a quick test.

65
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:52,620
Look at a sentence: ‘This problem (be) solved
by our IT team.’

66
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,420
Your job is to write five different versions
of this sentence.

67
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:01,060
One: write the sentence in the present simple.

68
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:08,259
Two: make it present continuous
Three: make it past simple.

69
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:11,700
Four: make it present perfect.

70
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,720
Five: make it future with ‘going to’.

71
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,980
Pause the video, and write your sentences.

72
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,900
You’ll see the answers in a few seconds.

73
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,900
Ready?

74
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,040
Here are the answers.

75
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,800
How did you do?

76
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,800
Could you write the five sentences correctly?

77
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,960
If you could, then well done!

78
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:40,130
If not, then you can review this section and
try to work out why you made mistakes.

79
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:46,130
OK, now you know the most important points
about how the passive is formed, but why do

80
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,699
you use the passive?

81
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,390
There are three common reasons to use the
passive voice.

82
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,960
One: you want to change the emphasis of your
sentence.

83
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,930
Two: the subject of your sentence is unknown
or unimportant.

84
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:11,080
Three: you want to sound more impersonal or
indirect.

85
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,740
Let’s look at these one by one.

86
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,220
First, use the passive to change the emphasis
of your sentence.

87
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:26,000
Look at two sentences: ‘Leonardo da Vinci
painted the Mona Lisa.’

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,540
‘The Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo da
Vinci.’

89
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,060
The first sentence is active, and the second
is passive.

90
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,400
What’s the difference?

91
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:48,150
If you’re not sure, think about this: which
is the most important idea in each sentence?

92
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:53,319
In the first sentence, you’re more interested
in Leonardo da Vinci.

93
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,240
In the second sentence, you’re more interested
in the Mona Lisa.

94
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,610
In English, putting an idea at the beginning
of a sentence shows that it’s more important.

95
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:09,290
You can use the passive to change the emphasis
of a sentence, and show what you think is

96
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,560
the most important idea.

97
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:18,440
Secondly, use the passive when the subject
is unknown or unimportant.

98
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,990
What does that mean?

99
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,960
Let’s look: ‘My bike was stolen.’

100
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,220
‘The kitchen has been cleaned today.’

101
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,620
‘She was arrested for shoplifting.’

102
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,889
Why do you think you use the passive in these
three cases?

103
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:42,069
In these examples, you either don’t know
or don’t care who did the action.

104
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:44,720
My bike was stolen—by whom?

105
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,440
I don’t know, and it doesn’t matter.

106
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,670
What matters is the fact that it was stolen.

107
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:54,170
I don’t have my bicycle any more.

108
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,389
The kitchen has been cleaned today—by whom?

109
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:00,070
Here, it doesn’t matter.

110
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,680
You only care about the fact that the kitchen
is now clean.

111
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,820
She was arrested—by whom?

112
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,970
By the police, of course!

113
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,360
You don’t care exactly who arrested her.

114
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,580
You know that the police arrested her, because
it’s obvious from the context.

115
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,259
No one else can arrest people.

116
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,860
In these sentences, you only care about the
action itself.

117
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,270
You don’t know or care who did it.

118
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:36,000
There’s one more common reason to use the
passive: to sound impersonal.

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,560
Here’s a question: what’s the difference
between these two examples?

120
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,040
‘You need to do this by the end of the week.’

121
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,320
‘This needs to be done by the end of the
week.’

122
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,900
If someone says this to you, the basic meaning
is the same.

123
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,330
So what’s the difference?

124
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:00,130
The second sentence, with the passive, is
more indirect and impersonal.

125
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:06,370
This is because it avoids the words ‘You
need to…’ which appear in the first sentence.

126
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,440
Using the passive in this way can help you
to sound more formal and polite.

127
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,420
Saying: ‘You need to do this by the end
of the week’ is very direct.

128
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:22,200
It sounds like an order, which could be rude
in some situations.

129
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,320
Now you know how to form the passive, and
the most common ways to use it, but there’s

130
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,680
one more important point.

131
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,550
Many problems English learners have with the
passive happen because they overuse it.

132
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:42,550
Here’s the important point: don’t use
the passive if you don’t have a good reason

133
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,290
to use it.

134
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:49,839
If you use the passive, especially when you’re
writing, think about why you’re using it.

135
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,920
Do you need to use it to change the emphasis
of your sentence?

136
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,370
Do you need to sound more formal and impersonal?

137
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:02,920
Do you want to focus on the action, instead
of whoever did the action?

138
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,600
If not, don’t use the passive.

139
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,930
Using the passive makes your sentences longer
and more complicated.

140
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,839
This isn’t good unless it’s necessary.

141
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:20,730
First, it’s inefficient, because you’ll
need more words to express the same ideas.

142
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,680
Second, it makes your writing harder to read.

143
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,800
Let’s do some quick practice.

144
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,560
You’re going to see five sentences.

145
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:35,390
For each one, you should decide if it’s
necessary to use the passive or not.

146
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:40,420
Here are the five sentences: ‘We were asked
by our friends to bring a dessert for the

147
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,080
party.’

148
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:50,100
‘The proposed policy is strongly supported
by conservative voters.’

149
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:57,340
‘It was decided not to follow the recommendations
outlined in the report.’

150
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,520
‘A variety of measures could be taken to
diminish the detrimental effects of global

151
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,360
warming.’

152
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,760
‘The website will be finished and ready
to launch by the end of the month.’

153
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,540
What do you think?

154
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,120
Are these good examples of using the passive,
or not?

155
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,100
Remember that to use the passive, you need
a good reason.

156
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,470
If there’s no reason, don’t use it.

157
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,460
Pause the video if you want more time to look
at these.

158
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,050
Otherwise, let’s look at the sentences.

159
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:38,430
In the first sentence, there’s no good reason
to use the passive.

160
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:45,000
Using the passive here only makes the sentence
longer and more inefficient.

161
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,820
The sentence should be active and direct:
‘Our friends asked us to bring a dessert

162
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,860
for the party.’

163
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,230
In the second sentence, you probably shouldn’t
use the passive.

164
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:03,100
You could argue that you use the passive here
to emphasise the idea of ‘proposed policy’,

165
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:09,269
but the words ‘proposed policy’ are vague,
and if you haven’t defined the idea, then

166
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:10,960
why emphasise it?

167
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,899
Again, this sentence should almost certainly
be active: ‘Conservative voters strongly

168
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:21,420
support the proposed policy.’

169
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,839
In the third sentence, there’s one possible
reason to use the passive: to make the sentence

170
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,329
more impersonal.

171
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:34,920
Perhaps you don’t want to say exactly *who*
decided to do this.

172
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,860
In this case, using the passive is appropriate.

173
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,700
The fourth sentence is a good example of passive
misuse.

174
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:50,030
The problem is that it’s easy to use the
passive voice to make unclear, empty sentences.

175
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,889
In this sentence, what exactly is the writer
saying?

176
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:58,689
‘A variety of measures’ is so vague that
it could mean anything.

177
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:04,050
Making this sentence active won’t solve
the problem; instead, you would need to be

178
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:09,260
more specific and explain your ideas more
precisely.

179
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,540
By the way, this is common in IELTS essays.

180
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,040
Again, it’s not a language problem; it’s
an ideas problem.

181
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,360
It’s possible to construct long, complicated
sentences using the passive which don’t

182
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,920
say anything, but this is bad writing and
it certainly won’t help you in an exam like

183
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,680
IELTS.

184
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,850
The fifth sentence is a good example of using
the passive.

185
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:41,089
In this case, it’s not important *who* will
finish the website; it’s important that

186
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:45,160
this work will be finished by the end of the
month.
