00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,730
Hi, I’m Gina.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,670
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:12,900
In this lesson, you can learn how to make
different types of complex sentence in English.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,020
Making complex sentences will help your English
writing.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:25,440
By using a variety of complex sentence forms,
your writing will become more versatile and

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,450
elegant.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,730
Using a range of complex sentences in your
writing is also important if you’re preparing

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:38,500
for an English writing exam like IELTS, TOEFL,
or FCE.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,140
Before we start, two things.

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,860
One: have you visited our website yet?

11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,540
If not, why not?

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:53,680
We have free video lessons, listening lessons,
quizzes, and also many professional teachers

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,540
who offer online lessons.

14
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:02,320
Check it out: Oxford Online English dot com.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:12,000
Two: we want to tell you about this lesson,
who it’s for, what’s in it and what isn’t.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,330
This lesson will focus on grammar structures
for forming complex sentences without using

17
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,920
conjunctions.

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,150
If you want to learn about using conjunctions
to form complex sentences, you can watch our

19
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,170
video about linking words for IELTS writing.

20
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,140
There’s a link in the video description.

21
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:43,340
Also, using these structures requires that
you have at least an intermediate knowledge

22
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,600
of English grammar.

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:53,820
This lesson assumes that you know how to form
different verb forms and use relative clauses,

24
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,240
among other things.

25
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,780
This lesson is technical and contains a lot
of information.

26
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,260
You might need to watch it in sections, and
repeat sections several times.

27
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,840
Finally, a warning!

28
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:17,219
Using complex sentences can enhance your writing,
but *only* if you have complex, coherent ideas

29
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:19,169
behind them.

30
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:24,769
If your ideas are basic, or incoherent, using
what you think are ‘advanced’ grammar

31
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,419
structures won’t help.

32
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:30,359
Okay, let’s start.

33
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:34,239
Here’s how this lesson will work.

34
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:43,840
First, look at four sentences:
Pause the video, read the sentences, and look

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,749
up any words you don’t know.

36
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:55,309
If you want to read more about tulip mania,
there’s a link to a Wikipedia article in

37
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,480
the video description.

38
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,740
Ready?

39
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:06,020
These sentences are all grammatically simple,
meaning that they each have one main verb.

40
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,920
Now, you’ll see four different grammatical
tools you can use to combine and add to these

41
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:19,500
sentences to make them richer and more complex.

42
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,930
Do you know what -ing participle clauses are,
and how you can use them?

43
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:34,980
If not, don’t worry; look at an example
based on our first sentence:

44
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:44,449
Here, you use a participle clause to connect
two ideas.

45
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:52,819
You can use an -ing participle clause to connect
two ideas which happen at the same time, or

46
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,260
to show cause and effect.

47
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:05,320
In this case, you could express the same idea
using ‘because’, like this:

48
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,540
The -ing participle clause does not have a
subject.

49
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:16,459
In a sentence like this with two clauses,
the -ing clause can *only* refer to the subject

50
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,410
in the second clause.

51
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,760
You can’t have two subjects.

52
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,680
When writing, make sure your sentence has
a clear subject.

53
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,520
Don’t write something like this.

54
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,400
Here, it isn’t clear what ‘it’ refers
to.

55
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,680
Let’s practise!

56
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,510
Here are two ideas.

57
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:44,690
Can you connect them using an -ing participle
clause?

58
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,700
Pause the video and think about your answer.

59
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,840
Want a hint?

60
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,080
Your answer should be quite similar to the
example you saw before.

61
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,840
Ready?

62
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Here’s the answer.

63
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:13,340
There’s one more way to use -ing clauses:
you can use a perfect -ing form, with ‘having’

64
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:20,500
plus a past participle, to show that one thing
happened before another.

65
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,120
For example:

66
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:33,020
So, quick review: you can use -ing participle
clauses to do three things.

67
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,520
Do you remember them?

68
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,310
One: use them to show that two actions happened
at the same time.

69
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:50,620
Two: use them to show cause and effect.

70
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:59,370
Three: use them—with ‘having’ plus a
past participle—to show that one thing happened

71
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,640
after another.

72
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:10,580
Remember that you can always review a section
if you need more time to work on it.

73
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:17,550
Let’s move on to our next point.

74
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:24,250
There are two kinds of participle clauses:
-ing clauses and -ed clauses.

75
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:31,560
Look at an example of two ideas linked with
an -ed participle clause:

76
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,920
This links two ideas.

77
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:42,160
You can use -ed participle clauses when you
have two clauses with the same subject, and

78
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,100
one of the clauses has a passive verb.

79
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:53,320
Like -ing clauses, -ed participle clauses
do not have a subject in the participle clause.

80
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,360
Let’s look at another example.

81
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:01,490
This time, you can try to make the complex
sentence:

82
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:06,740
Can you combine these two sentences with an
-ed participle clause?

83
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,340
Pause the video if you need time to make your
answer.

84
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,700
Ready?

85
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,300
Here’s the answer.

86
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:24,600
Because the -ed clause doesn’t have a main
verb, the verb tense information—‘had

87
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,380
been cultivated’—disappears in the -ed
clause.

88
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,840
However, no meaning is lost.

89
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:42,520
In these two sections, you’ve seen how to
use -ing and -ed participle clauses to link

90
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,320
two full, independent clauses.

91
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,520
However, there’s another way to use them.

92
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:58,370
Look at an example:
Can you see how this is different?

93
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:06,680
In this case, you’re using the -ed participle
clause not to replace an independent clause,

94
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,960
but instead to replace a relative clause.

95
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Relative clauses are one of the most powerful
ways to add and combine ideas in complex sentences.

96
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,020
Let’s look in more detail!

97
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,280
Relative clauses can do two things.

98
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:36,789
One: you can use a relative clause to add
information to a noun or noun phrase.

99
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:44,129
Two: you can use a relative clause with ‘which’
to add information to a sentence or idea.

100
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:50,509
Let’s look at an example of the first case:
using a relative clause to add information

101
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,120
to a noun.

102
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:00,860
Here, you use a relative clause—‘which
occurred in Holland’—to add information

103
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,480
to the noun phrase ‘tulip mania’.

104
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,180
Relative clauses used like this can *only*
describe the noun they come after.

105
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,440
Don’t write something like this:

106
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:23,870
If you’re using a relative clause to add
information to a noun, the clause *must* come

107
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,759
directly after the noun or noun phrase.

108
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:37,010
You can use multiple relative clauses in the
same sentence; for example:

109
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:44,480
Here, you add a second relative clause, with
‘when’, to add more information about

110
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,600
the noun ‘1637’.

111
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:55,579
Using multiple relative clauses like this
allows you to structure your ideas in different

112
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:57,259
ways.

113
00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:06,370
For example, you could also write this:
This might be useful if you want to add more

114
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:14,060
information about ‘Holland’ later in the
sentence, like this:

115
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,740
Let’s practise!

116
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:22,399
Look at two ideas:
Can you connect these two ideas using a relative

117
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,920
clause?

118
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,120
There are two possible answers.

119
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,880
Pause the video and make your answer.

120
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,120
Ready?

121
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,320
Here are the two possibilities.

122
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:38,139
Did you get the right answer?

123
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:42,800
Even better, did you get both?

124
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:50,840
For an extra challenge, can you add a third idea?

125
00:10:50,840 --> 00:11:01,780
Here’s a hint: ‘1637’ appears twice,
and you need to link the two instances.

126
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:09,709
Here’s the best way to do it:
Let’s look at one more point here.

127
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:18,680
You can also use a relative clause to add
information or explanation to a whole idea.

128
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,579
Look at an example:
Here, you’re using the relative clause to

129
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:27,940
explain the whole idea of the first clause.

130
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,629
You’re not just adding information to one
noun phrase.

131
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:37,350
To use relative clauses in this way, you need
to do two things.

132
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:43,040
One: you can *only* use ‘which’ as the
relative pronoun.

133
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:51,550
Two: your relative clause must add an explanation
or an opinion related to the idea before the

134
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,699
relative clause.

135
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:59,380
You can’t add factual information or details
in this way.

136
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:07,440
Now, let’s look at one more way to form
complex sentences.

137
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,839
To be a good writer, you should make it clear
which ideas are more important.

138
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:22,449
In English, ideas which are close to the beginning
of the sentence are more important than others.

139
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:29,920
So, if you want to emphasise an idea, you
should find a way to move it to the beginning

140
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,250
of the sentence.

141
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:43,389
You can do this by using ‘it’, like this:
Here, you’re focusing on the year, 1637.

142
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:50,769
Often, you use this structure to focus on
a factual detail, like a person, time, place

143
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,360
and so on.

144
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,560
You can also combine this with other structures
you’ve seen in this lesson.

145
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:05,610
For example, you could add a relative clause
to the end of this sentence, like this.

146
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,060
Look at a sentence.

147
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:17,260
You want to emphasise the idea of
‘Holland’ or the idea of ‘1593’.

148
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:26,100
Can you write two different sentences, starting
with ‘it’, to emphasise these two ideas?

149
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,760
Pause the video and do it now.

150
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,540
Did you get your answers?

151
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:37,059
Take a look.

152
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:42,029
In the first sentence, you’ll probably need
to change the structure a little by separating

153
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:47,640
‘in 1593’ from the main clause using a
comma.

154
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,620
Now, you’ve seen several ways to form complex
sentence structures in English.

155
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:56,759
What should you do if you want more practice?

156
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:02,970
First, you can use a grammar book or other
resources to practise the topics you’ve

157
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,740
seen in this lesson.

158
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:13,981
Look for chapters and exercises on -ing participle
clauses, -ed participle clauses, relative

159
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:17,430
clauses, and cleft sentences.

160
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:24,860
‘Cleft sentences’ are also called ‘focusing
clauses’ in some books and materials.

161
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:31,019
Secondly, remember that the ideas in this
lesson are not the only way to connect ideas

162
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,279
into complex sentences.

163
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,709
You should also learn how to use a range of
conjunctions and linking phrases to build

164
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,040
sentences.
