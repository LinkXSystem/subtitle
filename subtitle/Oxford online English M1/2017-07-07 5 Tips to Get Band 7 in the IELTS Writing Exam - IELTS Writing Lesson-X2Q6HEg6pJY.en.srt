00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,900
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,210
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,580
Do you need band seven in IELTS?

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,750
Are you maybe stuck at band six or 6.5?

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:18,840
If you’ve taken the IELTS exam many times,
and you can’t seem to get higher than six

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,250
in the writing exam, this video is for you.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,900
If you’re stuck at band six, then it’s
likely that you have some bad habits and ineffective

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,730
approaches to the writing exam.

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:37,059
These are things that might work well at band
six, but they won’t help you to get band

10
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:38,059
seven.

11
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:44,710
I’ll show you what these ineffective habits
are, and how you can change them.

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,809
One point: I’ll be focusing on the academic
IELTS exam in this video, because most of

13
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:53,309
the students I meet need academic IELTS.

14
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,329
If you’re taking general IELTS, most of
the advice in this video is still very relevant

15
00:00:58,329 --> 00:00:59,949
for you.

16
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:04,269
Also, one more thing: there’s nothing wrong
with getting band six!

17
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:08,180
I’m not trying to be rude or discouraging
to anyone.

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,219
When I say that something is a bad habit,
or that you need to change something, I mean

19
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:16,910
if you want to get band 7.0 in the IELTS writing
exam.

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,910
But first…

21
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,420
Do you know how IELTS scoring works?

22
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,420
You should.

23
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,810
Here’s why:

24
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:27,020
The IELTS scoring system is very specific.

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:33,520
The examiners don’t just look at your writing
and say, “Hmmm, this feels like a… six!”

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,079
If you get band six in the IELTS writing exam,
there are specific reasons why.

27
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:44,729
There are specific things which you did or
didn’t do which explain your score.

28
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:51,210
Similarly, to get band seven, there are specific
things you need to do, and not do!

29
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:58,290
Most importantly: these things are very different
between bands six and seven.

30
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,049
If you keep taking IELTS, and you keep getting
band six in the writing, then you can’t

31
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:07,249
keep doing the same things and expect to get
a different score.

32
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:10,399
You need to change what you do.

33
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,860
The things you need to do to get band seven
in your IELTS writing aren’t magic or some

34
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,450
kind of dark secret.

35
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,629
They’re publicly available.

36
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:20,970
You can read what they are.

37
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,170
You can do it right now!

38
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,560
There’s a link underneath the video.

39
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:32,120
I highly recommend you read the scoring criteria
and think about what band seven means.

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,260
At the very least, you need to understand
that your IELTS writing score is made up of

41
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:43,099
four different parts: task achievement, coherence
and cohesion, lexical resource (which means

42
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,590
vocabulary) and grammar.

43
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,150
Think now: where are you weakest?

44
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,830
What do you need to work on from these four
areas?

45
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,920
In the rest of this lesson, we’ll talk about
each of these four areas.

46
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,379
You’ll see common examples of ‘band six
thinking’, and you’ll see how you can

47
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:07,129
improve your approach to get a higher IELTS
writing score.

48
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:11,440
Let’s start with task achievement.

49
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,220
Here are the some ideas that are great for
getting band six:

50
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:21,000
“In task one, I need to include every statistic
and piece of data.”

51
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:28,299
“In task two, I just need to write something
about the general topic in the question.”

52
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:32,580
By the way, to save myself saying ‘task
achievement’ again and again, I’m going

53
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,920
to call it ‘TA’.

54
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,519
Getting band 7 for TA is both easy and hard.

55
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,189
Here’s why it’s easy: you just need to
do everything which the question asks you

56
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,160
to do, and nothing else.

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,910
Here’s why it’s hard: most people can’t
do that without a lot of practice.

58
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,629
TA is also slightly different for task one
and task two, so we’ll talk about those

59
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:56,629
separately.

60
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:59,269
Let’s start with task one.

61
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:02,530
Here’s a sample question:

62
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:09,230
The graph below shows the sales of five different
food products in the UK between 1980 and 2010.

63
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,959
Summarise the information by selecting and
reporting the main features, and make comparisons

64
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,780
where relevant.

65
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,500
If you want some time to look at the question,
pause the video.

66
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,259
If you’re watching on YouTube, you can see
the question on the full version of this lesson

67
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:28,870
on our website: Oxford Online English dot
com.

68
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:34,550
Getting a good TA score depends a lot on what
you do before you start writing.

69
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,600
You need to analyse the task and make a clear
plan.

70
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,720
If you start writing without a clear plan,
it’s very hard to get a good TA score.

71
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:53,400
In task one, it’s important to find connections
or trends in the information you’re given.

72
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,639
For example, in this question, how could you
connect the data?

73
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:05,300
Here’s one idea: you could group the five
products into, first, products whose sales

74
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:12,330
fell over the period (ice cream and frozen
burgers), secondly, products whose sales rose

75
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:21,020
(tofu and chili sauce) and finally, products
whose sales stayed the same (salted peanuts).

76
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:27,970
Here’s another suggestion: group the five
products into big sellers (ice cream, frozen

77
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:34,760
burgers, and also chili sauce at the end of
the period), and small sellers (tofu, salted

78
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,410
peanuts, chili sauce at the beginning of the
period).

79
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,370
Which way do you think is better?

80
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:48,320
Actually, there isn’t one correct way to
do this, but you need to do something.

81
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,820
You can’t just write about each product,
one after another.

82
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,210
Well, you can, but you’ll probably get band
six for TA!

83
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,830
Whatever data you’re given, you need to
find connections and put the information into

84
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,039
groups which you create.

85
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:10,389
These groups will be separate paragraphs in
your answer.

86
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:15,090
This is how your answer will have structure,
which is also important for your coherence

87
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,050
and cohesion score.

88
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,840
What about task two?

89
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,380
Let’s look at a sample question:

90
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:53,740
The most common problem in task two is leaving
something out or not covering something fully.

91
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:59,319
To get band 7 for TA, you need to do all of
the things the question is asking you to do,

92
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,990
and only the things the question is asking
you to do.

93
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,600
What does that mean here?

94
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,639
The task says, ‘discuss both of these viewpoints.’

95
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:16,099
First, you need to discuss the idea ‘that
young people benefit from working while studying

96
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:19,120
at school or university.’

97
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,169
One word here is particularly important.

98
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:24,699
Do you know which one?

99
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:28,120
‘Benefit’ is a key word here.

100
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,729
What does ‘benefit’ mean?

101
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:32,780
How do you understand it in this question?

102
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,800
Next, you need to discuss the idea, ‘young
people will achieve more by focusing on their

103
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
studies.’

104
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,710
Again, there’s a key phrase here: ‘achieve
more’.

105
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,860
What does this mean?

106
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,470
You need to have answers to these questions.

107
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:56,009
IELTS tasks often contain abstract, general
words like advantages, benefits, problems,

108
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,009
success, etc.

109
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:03,900
To write a good answer, you need to analyse
and interpret these words yourself.

110
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,349
Here, think about ‘achieve more’.

111
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:12,440
How do you understand this term in this question?

112
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,370
Does it mean getting good exam results, learning
more knowledge, learning practical skills,

113
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:23,180
getting a better job, living a full, satisfying
life, or something else?

114
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:29,729
Again, there isn’t one right answer here,
but you need to have your own ideas about

115
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:30,729
this.

116
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:33,810
Next, the task says, ‘give your own opinion’.

117
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,590
So, you need to explain which side you agree
with.

118
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:44,380
Finally, the task tells you to give reasons
and include examples.

119
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,030
This means that you need to support your ideas.

120
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,390
You can’t just say something like:

121
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,870
Young people who focus on their studies will
achieve more.

122
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,100
If you make a point like this, you need to
support it somehow.

123
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,750
How will they achieve more?

124
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,480
What examples can you give to show that this
is true?

125
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,320
Let’s review: for this question, you need
to do four things to get a good TA score:

126
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,770
1.

127
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:18,120
Discuss the idea ‘that young people benefit
from working while studying at school or university,’

128
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,000
and analyse what ‘benefit’ means.

129
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,580
Discuss the idea that, ‘young people will
achieve more by focusing on their studies,’

130
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,840
and analyse what ‘achieve more’ means.

131
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,800
Give your own opinion and reach a clear conclusion.

132
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,540
Support your ideas with reasons or examples.

133
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,920
If you can do these four things, you can get
band 7 for TA in your IELTS writing exam.

134
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,460
Remember though, it’s not as simple as it
looks.

135
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,470
You will probably need to practise to get
this right.

136
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,610
Next, let’s look at your coherence and cohesion
score.

137
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:05,640
I’m going to refer to coherence and cohesion
as C&C, to keep things simple.

138
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,250
Here are the habits which can limit your C&C
score to six:

139
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,060
“I need to use more linking words to get
a higher score.”

140
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:21,320
“My essay should have an introduction, two
body paragraphs and a conclusion.”

141
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,180
Let’s look at each point separately.

142
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,300
Oh, hey, Oli!

143
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,420
How was your IELTS exam?

144
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,420
Amazing!

145
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,450
I totally nailed it.

146
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,850
I used nevertheless, furthermore, however,
in spite of the fact that, AND in addition.

147
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,120
My band 7 score is GUARANTEED!

148
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,200
No, it doesn’t work like that.

149
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,160
First of all, linking isn’t just about linking
words.

150
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,080
It’s about the logic and flow of your ideas.

151
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,480
Look at a sentence:

152
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,590
Air pollution is a serious problem.

153
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:01,360
However, food prices are higher than ten years
ago.

154
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,460
Using however here doesn’t magically make
these ideas connected.

155
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,730
These two ideas aren’t connected, and you
can’t create a connection by using a word

156
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,970
like however.

157
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:18,020
Next, there’s nothing in the IELTS scoring
system which says you get a higher score for

158
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,240
using more linking words.

159
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,340
It’s more important to make sure you use
linking words accurately.

160
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,440
Using more linking words won’t get you band
seven.

161
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,520
However, using linking words incorrectly will
get you band six.

162
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,920
So, don’t use linking words just to use
linking words.

163
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,960
Use them because they fit your ideas.

164
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,400
Don’t think, “I have to use nonetheless
to get a high score!”

165
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
You don’t.

166
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,390
Next, let’s look at our second point: paragraphing.

167
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,590
Many IELTS candidates use the same structure
for everything they write.

168
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:01,140
For example, for task two, most people write
an introduction, two body paragraphs, and

169
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,330
a conclusion.

170
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,780
That might be fine.

171
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:10,860
However, to get band 7 for C&C, you need to
“present a clear central topic within each

172
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,810
paragraph.”

173
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,230
Those aren’t my words.

174
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,670
That’s straight from the IELTS scoring scheme.

175
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:23,450
Many students, especially in task two, write
paragraphs like this:

176
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:32,970
There are many advantages to … Firstly,
… Secondly, … Thirdly, …

177
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,290
This kind of writing is likely to get a score
of 6 for C&C.

178
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,290
Why?

179
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:44,320
Because, if you do this, you’re trying to
put too much in one paragraph.

180
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,150
That means your paragraph won’t have a clear
central topic.

181
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,430
So, what’s the solution?

182
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,750
First, plan your essay carefully.

183
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:01,690
Make sure you know exactly what you’re putting
in each paragraph before you start writing.

184
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,380
Secondly, make sure your paragraph starts
with a clear topic sentence.

185
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,990
Your topic sentence should be relatively short
and simple.

186
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:18,390
If your topic sentence is very long and complicated,
then your topic probably isn’t clear.

187
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:24,350
Then, after your topic sentence, spend the
rest of the paragraph developing and extending

188
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,680
your main idea.

189
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,060
This means that you aren’t adding any new
ideas or changing the topic in the middle

190
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,580
of your paragraph.

191
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:37,570
Also, this means you might need different
numbers of paragraphs depending on how many

192
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,660
main ideas you have.

193
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,870
Do you have two body paragraphs in your essay?

194
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,310
That means you have two main ideas.

195
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,320
Do you have three main ideas?

196
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,030
Then you need three paragraphs!

197
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,980
Another point: paragraphs don’t have a minimum
length.

198
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,350
There’s no such thing as a paragraph which
is too short.

199
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,650
Paragraphs can be any length.

200
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,140
So, let’s review this section.

201
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,530
To get band seven C&C in your IELTS writing
exam, you need to focus on using linking words

202
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,710
accurately and appropriately.

203
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:18,110
You also need to make sure every paragraph
has a clear central topic, which means you

204
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,620
shouldn’t try to put many different ideas
in one paragraph.

205
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:29,040
Next, let’s look at vocabulary and how you
can get to band seven.

206
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,190
Here’s a band six idea that students often
have:

207
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:39,000
“I need to learn lots of synonyms and uncommon
vocabulary.

208
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,660
If my vocabulary is bigger, I’ll get a higher
score.”

209
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:48,320
There’s one important difference between
band six and seven for vocabulary.

210
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,190
At band six, you need two things: range and
clarity.

211
00:14:54,190 --> 00:15:00,310
That means, if you at least try to use some more advanced or uncommon vocabulary, you can get six if

212
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:06,870
your meaning is clear, even if you make mistakes,
even if you make lots of mistakes.

213
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:13,320
However, for band seven, you need three things:
range, clarity and accuracy.

214
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,570
It’s no longer enough just to try.

215
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:22,200
You need to use vocabulary “with flexibility
and precision”—again, this is a quote

216
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,160
from the official scoring scheme.

217
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,040
You can’t make many mistakes for band seven.

218
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,290
You can produce ‘occasional errors’ and
still get band seven.

219
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,540
What does this mean for you?

220
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,570
It means that your priority should be avoiding
mistakes.

221
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:47,750
I see many IELTS students trying to learn
lots of idioms, phrases, academic vocabulary

222
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,760
and so on.

223
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,240
But then, they often don’t know how to use
this vocabulary well.

224
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,650
They use it in their writing, because they
think it sounds nice, and their meaning might

225
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,190
be clear, but it’s not correct.

226
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:07,040
That’s fine for band six, but not for band
seven.

227
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,910
So, what should you do?

228
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,880
Look, first of all, vocabulary learning is
hard work and it’s slow.

229
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,050
There aren’t any magic solutions here.

230
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,420
But I’ll give you one tip:

231
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:27,010
When you’re learning vocabulary, focus on
quality and depth, not quantity.

232
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:30,750
Don’t try to learn 50 words or phrases.

233
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,230
Learn five words or phrases, but really learn
them.

234
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:40,070
Spend an hour learning and practising five
new words and phrases.

235
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,800
Find example sentences.

236
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,060
Write your own example sentences.

237
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,280
Ask a teacher or whoever you can find to give
you feedback.

238
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,070
Make sure you know how to use your new vocabulary
correctly.

239
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,790
Another point: in the exam, if you have a
choice between a simple word which you know

240
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:04,130
is correct, and a more advanced or academic
word which you aren’t sure about, what should

241
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,449
you do?

242
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:08,130
Use the simple word.

243
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:14,080
Only use vocabulary you’re sure you understand
and that you know how to use.

244
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,100
This is the opposite to band six.

245
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:21,080
For band six, you can use the more advanced
word, even if it’s wrong.

246
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,700
But remember, to get band seven, you need
to be accurate.

247
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,140
You can’t make many mistakes.

248
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,330
So, in this situation, take the safe choice!

249
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,860
Finally, let’s look at the grammar score
and how you can get to band seven.

250
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,830
Here’s the band six idea which students
often have:

251
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,770
“Grammar’s not so important, so long as
people can understand what I mean.”

252
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:48,770
Again, band six and band seven are very different.

253
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,790
This is especially true for your grammar score.

254
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,440
What’s the difference?

255
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,680
Like vocabulary, you need to be accurate to
get band seven.

256
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,560
At band six, it doesn’t really matter how
many grammar mistakes you make so long as

257
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,610
your meaning is clear.

258
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:11,570
At band seven, the quantity of grammar errors
you make matters.

259
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,020
It really matters!

260
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:19,900
To get band seven for grammar, you need to
“produce frequent error-free sentences”—again,

261
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,040
these words are directly from the official
IELTS scoring scheme.

262
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,790
That means if you make a lot of small mistakes,
it’s almost impossible to get band seven

263
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,450
for grammar.

264
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,210
All mistakes count: you use the wrong preposition?

265
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,940
It’s a mistake.

266
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,900
You forget to use the?

267
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,050
Mistake.

268
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,840
You forget the ‘s’ on a present simple
verb?

269
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,380
Mistake.

270
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,260
If your writing is around band six, you probably
make more mistakes than you realise.

271
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,200
So, again, what can you do?

272
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,780
First, you need to identify the common mistakes
which you make.

273
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:03,810
For this, you need a teacher to show you where
you make mistakes in your writing.

274
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,740
Every time you do some writing, look at the
grammar mistakes you make.

275
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,350
Sort them into two categories.

276
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,860
One: mistakes with things you don’t know.

277
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,530
Two: mistakes with things you already knew.

278
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:25,280
For example, if you write ‘childrens’
instead of ‘children’, this is probably

279
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,050
a type two mistake.

280
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,110
Most likely, you knew this already.

281
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:36,590
You just made a mistake, because you were in a hurry, or you were tired, or you have

282
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,720
a bad habit, or you weren't paying attention, or something like that.

283
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,430
With type one mistakes—things you don’t
know—get a good grammar book and study to

284
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,560
fill the gaps in your knowledge.

285
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:55,630
With type two mistakes, put your errors into
a digital flashcard app like Anki or Quizlet

286
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,620
or something like that.

287
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,540
For example:

288
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:05,120
Question: This is one of most serious problems
in today’s world.

289
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,820
Answer: This is one of the most serious problems
in today’s world.

290
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:16,480
Every time you write something, add your mistakes
as questions to your flashcard app.

291
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,430
Review your mistakes regularly—every day
is best!

292
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:25,930
This approach requires a lot of patience,
but it’s the only effective way to get rid

293
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:31,360
of those bad habits which can stop you getting
band seven in IELTS writing.

294
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,380
Okay, so now you should have some ideas about
how to get band seven in your IELTS writing

295
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,390
exam.

296
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:43,390
There’s a lot of information in this lesson,
and there’s also a lot which I didn’t

297
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,390
say!

298
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:49,140
Band seven is a high standard, and you should
accept that it will take time and work to

299
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,930
get there.

300
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,640
Do you have an IELTS experience which you
think people could learn from?
