00:00:01,329 --> 00:00:03,250
Hi, I’m Kae.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,960
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,980
In this lesson, you can learn about intonation
in English.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,940
How important is intonation?

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,740
Let’s see.

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,300
Look at a sentence:

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,640
Do you need some help?

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,340
It’s a simple question, but by changing
the intonation, you can change the meaning

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,410
completely.

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,150
For example, it can be a simple question,
where you’re really offering to help:

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,500
Do you need some help?

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,909
It can be a rhetorical question, where you
don’t really think the person needs help,

13
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,510
but you want to be polite:

14
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,140
Do you need some help?

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,620
It can show that you’re annoyed with the
person you’re talking to:

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,980
Do you need some help?

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,720
It can be sarcastic:

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,180
Do you need some help?

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,339
It can show surprise that the other person
might need your help:

20
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:02,460
Do you need some help?

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,119
There are other possibilities, too!

22
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,790
You can see that intonation is a very powerful
tool.

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,460
Controlling your intonation is important for
communication in spoken English.

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:23,630
So, let’s start at the very beginning: what
actually is intonation?

25
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,080
There are seven possible intonation patterns
in English:

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,960
rising
falling

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,440
rising-falling
falling-rising

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,540
flat
high

29
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,920
low

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,080
The most important are the first four: rising,
falling, and combinations of rising and falling

31
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
tones.

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:58,400
Flat tones, including high and low tones,
aren’t common and don’t have many uses,

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,370
so we won’t talk about them today.

34
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:06,750
However, rising and falling tones can each
have many different meanings.

35
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,610
Keep this in mind: one intonation pattern
does not mean one thing.

36
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,170
The same intonation can have different meanings
in different situations.

37
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,420
Also, intonation is flexible.

38
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,650
There are rules, but the rules are not one
hundred per cent fixed.

39
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,060
Different people speak in different styles.

40
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,380
Let’s practice!

41
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,530
Here’s a word:
Let’s try saying the word with different

42
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,240
intonation patterns.

43
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,460
Repeat after me.

44
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,280
Rising: where?

45
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,000
Falling: where?

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,780
Rising-falling: where?

47
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,120
Falling-rising: where?

48
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,819
Let’s try one more time, with two words:

49
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,110
How many?

50
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:17,069
Rising: how many
Falling: how many?

51
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:23,100
Rising-falling: how many?

52
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,000
Falling-rising: how many?

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,110
If you can pronounce these four intonation
patterns, you can already do most of what

54
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,080
you need in English.

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,730
So, how do you use these intonation patterns?

56
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,870
The most basic rule is that you use a falling
tone to show the end of a sentence.

57
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,140
For example:
I live in Madrid.

58
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,270
She’s a lawyer.

59
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,720
We might be a bit late.

60
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,270
You can use a rising tone to show that your
sentence isn’t finished yet.

61
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,590
For example:
I live in Madrid, but I was born in Canada.

62
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:12,410
She’s a lawyer, although she isn’t working
at the moment.

63
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,039
We might be a bit late, because I don’t
finish work until seven.

64
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:21,419
That’s the most basic rule, and it’s important.

65
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:27,400
If you don’t use rising or falling tones
in the right places, people won’t understand

66
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,659
whether you’ve finished speaking or not.

67
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:36,960
However, there are many other ways to use
these intonation patterns.

68
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,830
Let’s look at another.

69
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,970
Did you get some bread?

70
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,240
I thought you were going to get the bread!

71
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,939
How are we going to make sandwiches if we
don’t have any bread?

72
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:53,469
We can go to the bakery and buy some sandwiches
there.

73
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:57,139
But, I think the bakery is closed on Saturdays.

74
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,880
It’s not Saturday today; it’s Sunday!

75
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,420
Oh…

76
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,100
Can you work out what was going on in that
dialogue?

77
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,979
After the first question: did you get some
bread, you heard five sentences.

78
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:18,080
Listen again if you need to; can you hear
the intonation?

79
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,940
Before, you heard that you use falling intonation
at the end of your sentence, but here, the

80
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,340
pattern is often the opposite:

81
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,220
I thought you were going to get the bread!

82
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:34,830
Do you know why this is?

83
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,629
This is our second rule about intonation:
you use a falling tone to show that information

84
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:45,099
is new, and you use a rising tone for old
information.

85
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:50,290
In this sentence, the bread has already been
mentioned, so it’s ‘old’ information,

86
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,669
and you pronounce it with a rising tone.

87
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:58,879
However, the word you gets a falling tone,
because this is the new idea in the sentence.

88
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,939
Let’s look at the next example:

89
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:09,580
How are we going to make sandwiches if we
don’t’ have any bread?

90
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,940
Here, the idea is the same.

91
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,819
The bread is ‘old’ information, so you
pronounce it with a rising tone.

92
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,909
The sandwiches are new information; this is
the first time anyone has talked about sandwiches.

93
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:28,099
New information gets a falling tone.

94
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:37,320
In the next sentence, which word is ‘old’
information, and which word is ‘new’ information?

95
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,960
Sandwiches are ‘old’ information, because
we already mentioned them.

96
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,529
So, pronounce sandwiches with a rising tone.

97
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:54,090
The bakery is ‘new’ information, because
this is the first time anyone has mentioned

98
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,090
it.

99
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,590
So, bakery has a falling tone.

100
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:04,839
In the last two sentences, the pattern is
reversed, but the idea is the same:

101
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,580
But, I think the bakery is closed on Saturdays.

102
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,460
It’s not Saturday today; it’s Sunday!

103
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,719
In the first sentence, the bakery is now ‘old’
information, so it gets a rising tone.

104
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:27,849
The ‘new’ information, with a falling
tone, comes at the end of the sentence.

105
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:33,810
You can see the same pattern in the second
sentence: the ‘old’ information—Saturday—comes

106
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:39,679
first, and the ‘new’ information—Sunday—is
at the end of the sentence.

107
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:44,210
If you want more practice with this, go back
to the dialogue.

108
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,779
Pause after each sentence, and repeat, trying
to copy the intonation.

109
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:54,770
Pay attention to the way intonation changes
on the same word as it changes from new to

110
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,520
old information.

111
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:05,580
Now let’s look at a very important use
of intonation: questions.

112
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,740
Where did you go for your vacation?

113
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,460
I went to Dubrovnik.

114
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,180
Is that in Croatia?

115
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,340
Yes, on the coast.

116
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,919
Have you ever been?

117
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:16,149
No, never.

118
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:18,199
Did you have a good time?

119
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,800
Very nice, though it’s quite touristy.

120
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,479
You got back yesterday, right?

121
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,360
Yeah, late in the evening.

122
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,940
Are you feeling tired?

123
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:30,330
No, not too bad, actually!

124
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,099
In the dialogue, you heard six questions.

125
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,220
Three of them had rising tones, and three
had falling tones.

126
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,180
Do you know why the intonation is different
in different questions?

127
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,440
Sometimes, when you’re asking a question,
you have no idea of the answer.

128
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,020
You’re asking a question to find out new
information.

129
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,070
In this case, the question has a falling tone:

130
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:02,450
Where did you go for your vacation?
Have you ever been?

131
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,540
Did you have a good time?

132
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,910
Sometimes, when you ask a question, you already
have some idea of the answer.

133
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:18,770
You’re asking a question to check something,
or to confirm that your idea is right.

134
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,660
In this case, the question has a rising tone:

135
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:30,880
Is that in Croatia? --> I think Dubrovnik
is in Croatia, but I’m asking to make sure.

136
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,960
You got back yesterday, right? --> I had
an idea that you got back yesterday, and I’m

137
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,280
confirming this with you.

138
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:45,080
Are you feeling tired? --> You told me you
got back late in the evening, so I guess you’re

139
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,700
tired.

140
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,740
This means that the intonation of a question
can change depending on the situation.

141
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,140
If you use a falling tone, this becomes a question
to find new information.

142
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,580
This means you really have no idea whether
Dubrovnik is in Croatia or not, and you want

143
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,000
to know.

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,380
You can ask:

145
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,860
Where did you go for your vacation?

146
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:16,160
If you ask this with a rising tone, it could
suggest that you knew the answer before, and

147
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,080
you just want a reminder.

148
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:27,070
You’re checking something you already knew;
you’re not asking for completely new information.

149
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:32,370
Using this intonation will help you to sound
more natural, but it doesn’t change the

150
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,300
meaning of the question.

151
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:43,110
However, there are many other intonation patterns
in questions which do have different meanings.

152
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,220
Let’s look!

153
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,260
What a fantastic film! Wasn’t it great?

154
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,500
Are you insane? It was the worst movie I’ve
seen all year.

155
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,510
Why would you say that? It was amazing!

156
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,510
Forget it.

157
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,880
It’s two hours of my life I’m never getting
back.

158
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,500
Why don’t we get something to eat? Your
pick.

159
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,200
How about we just go home? I’m pretty
tired.

160
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,640
Again, you heard many questions in the dialogue.

161
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,740
Can you see what was different this time?

162
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,000
Before we tell you, think about a question.

163
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,900
What does a question do?

164
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,560
Most likely, you thought: “a question asks

165
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,600
for information.”

166
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,260
That’s sometimes true, but actually you
can use questions to communicate many other

167
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,260
ideas.

168
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,350
In these cases, a question might not need
an answer.

169
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:44,360
For example, you can use questions to make
a comment about something: Wasn’t it great?

170
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:52,360
You can use questions to criticise someone
or disagree with them: Are you insane?

171
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,700
You can use questions to make suggestions:
Why don’t we get something to eat?

172
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,730
Can you remember the intonation in these questions?

173
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,550
To make a comment about something, use a falling
tone:

174
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:11,700
Why would you say that?
Doesn’t he look smart?

175
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,190
Isn’t it delicious?

176
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,970
To criticise someone, use a rising tone:

177
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:23,150
Have you lost your mind?
Why would you do that?

178
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,740
Are you really that stupid?

179
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,300
To make a suggestion, use a falling tone:

180
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:38,280
How about we just go home?
Why don’t you call and ask what’s happening?

181
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,360
Remember that intonation is flexible, and
that’s especially true here.

182
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,210
You can also make a suggestion with a rising
tone:

183
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,650
How about we just go home?

184
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,090
Can you hear the difference?

185
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,180
How do you think it changes the meaning?

186
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:02,160
The suggestion with a rising tone sounds more
like a real question, because it sounds more

187
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,500
indirect and hesitant.

188
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,280
The suggestion with a falling tone doesn’t
sound so much like a question; it sounds more

189
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,960
confident and direct.

190
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:20,440
This brings us to our last point: you can
use intonation to express many different emotions.

191
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,860
There’s one intonation pattern we haven’t
talked about yet: rising-falling intonation.

192
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:33,860
You can use this to express different feelings:
positive or negative.

193
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:40,180
Look at one word:
You can use a rising-falling tone to sound

194
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:44,650
excited: really?

195
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:52,220
You can use it—slightly differently—to
sound annoyed: really?

196
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:58,150
You can use it to sound surprised: really?

197
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,580
Can you hear the difference between these
three?

198
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,980
Listen once more:
Really?

199
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,080
Really?

200
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,980
Really?

201
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,980
You use a rising-falling tone each time, but
in a slightly different way.

202
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,730
To sound excited or surprised, you start and
finish higher, but to sound annoyed, the tones

203
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,410
are lower: really?

204
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,639
really?

205
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:34,200
To sound surprised, you often make the rising
tone longer: really?

206
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,000
You can also use other tones to express some
emotions.

207
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:47,150
For example, you can use a rising tone to
express doubt: really?

208
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:53,160
You can use a falling tone to sound sarcastic:
really?

209
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,820
Let’s practice!

210
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,340
You’ll hear the same question with five
different kinds of intonation.

211
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,600
Which emotion am I expressing?

212
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,500
Did you?

213
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,720
Did you?

214
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,260
Did you?

215
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,380
Did you?

216
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,860
Did you?

217
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,880
Okay, we hope you learned something useful
about English intonation.

218
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,950
We have a question for you: is intonation
in your language similar to English, or not?

219
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,540
Let us know in the comments, because we’re
curious!
