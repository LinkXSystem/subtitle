00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,520
Hi, I’m Martin.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,970
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:14,790
In this lesson, you can learn how to use the
modal and semi-modal verbs 'should', 'ought

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,609
to', 'had better' and 'supposed to'.

5
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,940
We use these verbs to give advice, express
opinions, to give warnings or to criticise

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,460
someone.

7
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,370
These verbs are similar in meaning, but not
exactly the same.

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:39,460
That means you need to understand exactly
what each verb means to use them correctly

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,609
when you speak.

10
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,800
Let’s start with a basic introduction.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,829
Part one: how to use 'should.'

12
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:55,739
Let’s look quickly at the different ways
you can use 'should' in English.

13
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,359
For this lesson, we’ll use 'should' as our
‘base’ verb.

14
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,769
You’ll learn about the other verbs, like
'supposed to' or 'had better', by comparing

15
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,150
them to 'should'.

16
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,900
This means you need to have a good understanding
of 'should.'

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,820
First, you can use 'should' to give advice:

18
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,200
"You should buy the green one.

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,000
It suits you."

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,920
I advise you to do this.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,910
"You shouldn’t go to bed so late.

22
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,800
It’s bad for you."

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,690
This is my advice.

24
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,930
You can use 'should' to express your opinion.

25
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,350
"Everyone should see that film.

26
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,930
It’s amazing!"

27
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,560
I’m giving you my opinion about the film.

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,909
"The government should raise taxes on the
rich."

29
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:50,020
This is my opinion, what I think should happen.

30
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:57,659
Obviously, advice and opinion are similar,
and often they’re the same thing.

31
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,540
You can also use 'should'—often in the past—to
criticise someone else.

32
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,600
"You shouldn’t have said that."

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,740
I think you did the wrong thing.

34
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,239
"He should have studied harder for his exams."

35
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,920
I don’t think he studied hard enough.

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,139
What connects all of these cases?

37
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:30,469
In all these uses of 'should', you use 'should'
to express what you think is the best thing

38
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:32,230
to do.

39
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,909
If I say 'you should…', I mean 'I think
it’s best if you…'

40
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:42,930
Now, let’s look at 'ought to.'

41
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,120
Part two: 'should' vs. 'ought to'.

42
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,670
In meaning, 'ought to' is exactly the same
as 'should'.

43
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,519
If you can use 'should' in a sentence, you
can also use 'ought to'.

44
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,819
For example, you can say:

45
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:03,519
"You should buy the green one."

46
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:11,010
Or: "You ought to buy the green one."

47
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,989
You can say:

48
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:15,849
"Everyone should see that film."

49
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:22,139
Or: "Everyone ought to see that film."

50
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:25,939
There’s no difference in meaning.

51
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:33,769
In both cases, the two sentences with 'should'
and 'ought to' have the same meaning.

52
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:40,389
However, there are a couple of differences
in how you use 'ought to'.

53
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:51,480
First, 'ought to' is more formal, more old-fashioned,
and less common in modern spoken English.

54
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,389
That means you probably won’t use 'ought
to' unless you are writing, or you want to

55
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:59,829
sound very formal.

56
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:04,090
Secondly, 'ought to' has a slightly different
form.

57
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,909
Obviously, you need to add 'to'.

58
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:12,209
Also, the negative form is not generally contracted.

59
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,329
So, you can say:

60
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:16,850
"You shouldn’t have said that."

61
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,720
With 'should not', you can contract it to
'shouldn’t.'

62
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,460
However, with 'ought to', you need to use
the full form.

63
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,910
"You ought not to have said that."

64
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:36,820
Again, with 'ought to' the sentence sounds
very formal, and it’s unlikely that you’d

65
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,110
actually say this.

66
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:45,190
With 'should', you can make questions, like
this:

67
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,150
"What time should I get there?"

68
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:57,580
With 'ought to', you can technically make
questions, but they sound ridiculously formal:

69
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,120
"What time ought I to get there?"

70
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:10,410
This sounds really old-fashioned and unnatural,
so I advise that you don’t use 'ought to'

71
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,720
in this way!

72
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:18,010
So, to review, 'ought to' has the same meaning
as 'should', but a different form.

73
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,540
It’s also more formal and less common.

74
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,900
Let’s look at our next verb.

75
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,000
Part three: how to use 'supposed to.'

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,300
'Supposed to' is similar to 'should', but
there’s an important difference.

77
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,010
Look at two sentences:

78
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,910
"I should be there at 9:00."

79
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,000
"I’m supposed to be there at 9:00."

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,400
Can you see the difference in meaning?

81
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,890
If not, here’s a clue.

82
00:05:53,890 --> 00:06:00,260
Both sentences mean that someone thinks it’s
important for you to be there at 9:00.

83
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,180
The important question is: who thinks so?

84
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,830
The first sentence:

85
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,990
"I should be there at 9:00."

86
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,400
…means that you think this is important.

87
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,990
It’s important for you personally to be
there at 9:00.

88
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,750
The second sentence:

89
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,500
"I’m supposed to be there at 9:00."

90
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:30,400
…means that someone else thinks it’s important
for you to be there at 9:00.

91
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:38,750
You might not care, and using 'supposed to'
suggests that you probably don’t.

92
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:45,160
For example, imagine your boss organizes a
meeting for 9:00 one morning.

93
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,570
You know the meeting is going to be a waste
of time.

94
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,820
People will talk about a load of pointless
stuff, and the meeting will go on much longer

95
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,070
than it needs to.

96
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,520
However, your boss thinks it’s important
that everyone attends.

97
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,960
So, you might say:

98
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,530
"I’m supposed to go to the meeting at 9:00."

99
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:13,660
In this case, the meeting is not important
to you, but it is important to someone else

100
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,330
(your boss).

101
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,020
This is a good example of when you might use
'supposed to.'

102
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,590
Let’s do one more example.

103
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:31,840
Imagine we’re at a wedding, and I’m wearing
jeans and an old T-shirt.

104
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
You say:

105
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
"You should have worn something more formal!"

106
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,550
"You were supposed to wear something more
formal!"

107
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,650
Can you tell the difference now?

108
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:48,810
In the first sentence, with 'should', you’re
criticising me directly.

109
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:57,580
You think I look too scruffy, and that I made
a mistake by dressing too informally.

110
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:02,830
In the second sentence, with 'supposed to',
you’re suggesting that you don’t personally

111
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:10,080
care about my appearance, but that other people
might expect me to dress more formally.

112
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,550
There’s one more way to use 'supposed to'.

113
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,550
Look at an example:

114
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:21,200
"I was supposed to finish this essay yesterday."

115
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,340
Can you tell what this means?

116
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,830
It means that you didn’t finish your essay,
and you don’t really want to finish your

117
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,160
essay.

118
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:38,210
This shows you another common way to use 'supposed
to': use it to talk about things you don’t

119
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:43,180
want to do, or things which you aren’t planning
to do.

120
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,180
For example:

121
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,590
"I shouldn’t come with you to the cinema.

122
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,820
I’m supposed to be revising."

123
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,580
I’m not revising, and I don’t want to.

124
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,170
In fact, maybe I will come to the cinema!

125
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:05,320
"I’m supposed to wear a tie, but hardly
anyone in the office actually does."

126
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,100
I don’t wear a tie, and I don’t care about
wearing one.

127
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:16,950
To review, 'supposed to' has a similar meaning
to 'should', but while 'should' expresses

128
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:23,920
what you think is the right thing to do, 'supposed
to' expresses what other people think is the

129
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,510
right thing to do.

130
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,820
Let’s move on!

131
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,100
Part four: how to use 'had better.'

132
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,250
Again, let’s start with a pair of sentences:

133
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,780
"You should finish everything today."

134
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,120
"You’d better finish everything today."

135
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,850
Can you tell the difference?

136
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:56,890
Here’s a clue: using 'had better' gives
more information than just using 'should'.

137
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:04,700
What extra information am I communicating
if I use 'had better' instead of 'should'?

138
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,190
'Had better' expresses a warning or a threat.

139
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,870
Like 'should', you’re giving advice or expressing
your opinion about the right thing to do.

140
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:21,500
However, with 'had better', you’re also
saying that something bad will happen if the

141
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,570
other person doesn’t listen to you.

142
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,480
So, if I say:

143
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,339
"You should finish everything today."

144
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,770
…using 'should' suggests that you have a
choice.

145
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:41,470
I think it’s better if you finish everything
today, but I don’t think it’s necessary.

146
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,210
But, if I say:

147
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,870
"You’d better finish everything today."

148
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:54,830
…I’m suggesting that you don’t really
have a choice, because if you don’t do what

149
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,940
I say, something bad will happen.

150
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:07,690
With 'had better', you can even put the bad
consequences into your sentence, like this:

151
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:13,260
"You’d better finish everything today, or
the boss won’t be happy."

152
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,560
Let’s look at some more examples:

153
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,120
"You’d better leave now, or you’ll miss
your train."

154
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,160
"He’d better apologise, or I’ll never
talk to him again!"

155
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,310
Sometimes, the bad consequence is a kind of
threat, like this:

156
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,940
"You’d better be on time, or you could lose
your job."

157
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:45,850
However, it can just be a way to motivate
the other person to do what you say:

158
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,750
"You’d better finish everything today, because
you won’t have time tomorrow."

159
00:11:50,750 --> 00:12:02,740
But, even if you don’t put the bad consequences
into your sentence, the idea is still there.

160
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,740
If I say:

161
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,649
"You’d better be on time."

162
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:13,680
You would still understand that something
bad will happen if you’re not on time, even

163
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,960
though I’m not saying what that bad thing
is.

164
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,470
Let’s do a review.

165
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:28,230
We use the verbs 'should', 'ought to', 'supposed
to' and 'had better' to say what you or other

166
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,070
people think is the right thing to do.

167
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:39,089
That means these verbs express advice, opinion,
criticism or (for 'had better'), warnings

168
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:40,440
or threats.

169
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,890
'Should' and 'ought to' have the same meaning,
although 'ought to' is much more formal and

170
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,910
is not commonly used in spoken English.

171
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:56,560
'Supposed to' refers to what other people
think is right, while 'should' expresses what

172
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,660
you think is right.

173
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:07,200
'Had better' expresses the idea that something
bad will happen if you don’t do what I say.

174
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,680
This is why 'had better' can also be used
to make threats or give someone a warning.

175
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,120
That’s the end of the lesson.

176
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,860
I hope it was helpful!
