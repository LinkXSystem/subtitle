00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:07,590
Hi, I'm Mike. Welcome to Oxford Online English.
In this lesson, you can learn about the modal

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:13,660
verb 'would' in English. Would you like to
learn more about 'would' and what it means?

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,529
If I asked you to tell me all the meanings
and uses of 'would' right now would you be

4
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:25,080
able to? Like all modal verbs, 'would' can
have many different meanings. These different

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,970
meanings aren't connected to each other, which
can make it difficult to work out what 'would'

6
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:37,090
means in different sentences or situations.
In this class, you'll see all the uses of

7
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:47,539
'would' and meanings. Let's start with the
most important use of 'would'.

8
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:49,609
Imagine your friend asks you:

9
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:55,180
What would you do if you were attacked by
a shark?

10
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:00,070
Why does your friend use would in this question?
And how should you answer?

11
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:06,500
Probably, your answer would also include would.
Maybe something like:

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,320
I’d probably try to hit it on the nose,
or poke it in the eye, or something like that.

13
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,110
Maybe I’d just try to swim away.

14
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:20,060
So, any ideas? Why do we use would here?

15
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:26,600
It’s because getting attacked by a shark
is very unlikely. We use would when we talk

16
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,620
about things which are either very unlikely,
or totally impossible.

17
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,450
For example:

18
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,070
What would you do if you could read people’s
thoughts?

19
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:41,790
Reading people’s thoughts is impossible,
so we use would. It’s a question about an

20
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,290
imaginary situation.

21
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,470
I would help you if I could.

22
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,790
I can’t help you, so I use would to show
that it’s impossible. This is like saying,

23
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,750
“I can’t help you.”

24
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,280
She would be here, but he has too much work
at the moment.

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:07,520
She’s not here, although she would be if
she didn’t have so much work.

26
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,890
In all of these cases, when you use would,
you’re talking about a situation which isn’t

27
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,710
true, and which you think will never happen.

28
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,940
That’s what it means when you use would
like this. You’re saying, “I think this

29
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,350
thing will never happen.”

30
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,710
If I won the lottery, I would…

31
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:33,770
You say would because you don’t think you’ll
ever win the lottery.

32
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:40,611
You can use would have plus a past participle
to talk about the past in the same way. For

33
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:43,080
example:

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,150
What would you have said if she’d seen you?
She didn’t see you, so you didn’t say

35
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,440
anything to her. I’m asking you a question
about an imaginary situation. I’m saying,

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,340
“Imagine a different version of the past,
where she did see you…”

37
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,060
I wouldn’t have come if I’d known it was
going to go on so late.

38
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,090
I didn’t know it was going to go on so late,
so I did come, but now I regret it! Imagine

39
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,900
you’re at an event and you have to get up
early tomorrow. The event goes on much later

40
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,670
than you expected, so you say this.

41
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,500
He wouldn’t have been much help, anyway.

42
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,990
He wasn’t there, so he couldn’t help,
but even if he had been there, he wouldn’t

43
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,110
have been able to help us.

44
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:35,260
This is the most common way to use would,
and probably the most complicated. However,

45
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,840
would has many other uses.

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,080
Let’s look!

47
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,390
If you want to ask someone to do something
for you, using would in your request can make

48
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,400
it sound more polite.

49
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,060
For example:

50
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,100
Can you tell me the time?
Will you get me a sandwich?

51
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,680
I want something to eat.

52
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,310
All of these requests are quite informal.
That can be fine, depending on the situation,

53
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:13,950
but sometimes you want to be a bit more formal,
so that you sound polite.

54
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,590
Would can be useful here. Look at the sentences.
Can you see how to use would?

55
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:25,340
Okay, let’s check your ideas:

56
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,900
Would you mind telling me the time?
Would you get me a sandwich?

57
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,870
I’d like something to eat.

58
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:38,540
Using would you mind + -ing is a very polite
way to make a request.

59
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,690
You can also use would in place of will in
a request. This makes it a little more formal

60
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,220
and polite.

61
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,910
Finally, using would like instead of want
is better, unless you’re in a very informal

62
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,770
situation.

63
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,540
To be clear, these aren’t the only ways
to use would. There are other possible answers.

64
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,130
For example, you could say:

65
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,790
Tell me the time, would you?
Would you mind getting me a sandwich?

66
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:12,010
These are possible, but the first answers
I gave you are the most obvious.

67
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,850
Also, let’s get something clear: there’s
no connection between these different uses

68
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,130
of would.

69
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:24,000
If you use would to make a polite request,
like you’re doing here, there’s no connection

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,740
with the idea of imaginary or unreal situations
that you saw in part one.

71
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:35,590
Okay, let’s move on and look at another
way to use would.

72
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:44,590
Imagine you have a friend who’s always late
for everything. You’re meeting your friend

73
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,840
tomorrow, and you’re really annoyed that
you always have to wait. You tell your friend

74
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,700
to be on time, and she replies:

75
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,620
I’ll be on time, I promise! I’ll get an
earlier bus, which will get to the centre

76
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,620
by 3.00.

77
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,970
Now, imagine that it’s a few days later,
and you want to tell me what your friend said

78
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,600
to you. How would you do it?

79
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,080
You would say something like:

80
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,870
My friend promised she’d be on time. She
said she’d get an earlier bus, which she

81
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:22,410
said would arrive by 3.00. Of course, when
she turned up it was nearly 4.00!

82
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,520
Do you see what’s happening here?

83
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,450
Every time your friend says will, you say
would when you’re talking about what your

84
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,260
friend said.

85
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,270
English learners often say something like,
“Would is the past tense of will.” That’s

86
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,880
true sometimes, but not generally.

87
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:48,280
For example, for the uses of would you saw
in parts one and two, it’s not helpful or

88
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,940
accurate to say that would is the past tense
of will.

89
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,570
However, in reported speech, it’s a good
way to think about it.

90
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:02,960
There’s one more case where would has a
past meaning connected to will.

91
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,980
Do you know what I’m talking about?

92
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:16,090
Both will and would can have the meaning of
refusing to do something. For example:

93
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:22,820
I’ll ask him, but he won’t help me. He’ll
refuse to help me (in the future).

94
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:29,930
I asked him, but he wouldn’t help me. He
refused to help me (in the past).

95
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:35,470
In this case, you can use would as the past
version of will.

96
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,400
You can use this to talk about people:

97
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,780
They wouldn’t give me my money back, even
though I had the receipt.

98
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,650
They refused to give me my money back.

99
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,960
You can also use it to talk about things:

100
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:56,480
My car wouldn’t start this morning.
My car ‘refused’ to start. Okay, cars

101
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,340
can’t literally refuse to start, but we
often talk about machines, computers and things

102
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,590
like that in this way.

103
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,150
Here’s a similar example:

104
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:11,840
When he tried to show me, the file wouldn’t
open.

105
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,400
So here and in part three—reported speech—the
meanings of will and would are connected.

106
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,170
When you’re thinking about how to use will
and would, it’s important to remember that

107
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:27,020
sometimes the meanings are connected, and
sometimes they’re completely different.

108
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,440
We’ll come back to this point at the end
of the lesson.

109
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,400
There’s one more way to use would that we
need to look at:

110
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:46,150
You can use would to talk about things you
did in the past, but don’t do now.

111
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,650
For example:

112
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,800
My mum would walk us to school when we were
little.

113
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,960
When I was training for the marathon, I would
go running for two hours every day after work.

114
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,090
It was exhausting!

115
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:06,000
Would is similar to used to here, but it’s
not exactly the same.

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,801
When you use would like this, you can only
talk about repeated actions in the past. You

117
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:16,830
can’t talk about states and situations,
like you can with used to.

118
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,380
So, you can’t say:

119
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,810
I would live in a small flat with my friends
when I was a student.

120
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,839
That’s not correct, because live is a state,
not an action.

121
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,020
However, this sentence is okay:

122
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,540
I would go out with my friends most evenings
when I was a student.

123
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,790
This is fine, because go out is an action.

124
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:46,740
So, now you’ve seen all the different ways
you can use would in English.

125
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,003
Let’s review what you’ve learned today.

126
00:09:49,003 --> 00:09:55,700
Would has five common uses in English. It
can be used:

127
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:02,760
To talk about imaginary or unreal situations.
To make polite requests.

128
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,630
In reported speech, as the past version of
will.

129
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:13,800
To mean ‘refused to’.
To talk about repeated actions in the past.

130
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,800
When you’re learning about how to use would,
one of the most important things to get clear

131
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,190
in your head is the relationship between will
and would.

132
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,670
Sometimes will and would are connected: if
you’re using reported speech, or using would

133
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:34,400
to mean ‘refused to’, then would behaves
like a past version of will.

134
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,410
However, in the other uses of would, there
is no connection between will and would. In

135
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:45,520
fact, in the most common use of would—talking
about imaginary or unreal situations—will

136
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,940
and would have almost opposite meanings.

137
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:54,210
For example, if someone says, “I’ll help
you,” with will, you can expect them to

138
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,930
help you, in reality.

139
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:01,690
If someone says, “I would help you,” with
would, then you shouldn’t expect them to

140
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,529
help you. Will and would have completely different
meanings here.

141
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:11,330
It’s also good to remember that the different
uses of would aren’t connected to each other

142
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:17,620
at all. The meaning of would depends completely
on the sentence and the situation.

143
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,980
Finally, would can refer to different times
depending on how you’re using would. For

144
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,680
example:

145
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,380
I would come tomorrow, but I’ve already
made other plans.

146
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,360
Would you pass me that blue bag?
I asked them to change my ticket, but they

147
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,350
wouldn’t do anything.

148
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:45,410
These three sentences are about the future,
the present and the past, respectively.

149
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:51,240
So you can’t say what time would refers
to by itself. It can refer to any time depending

150
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,279
on the meaning and the context.

151
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,550
Most importantly, would doesn’t necessarily
have a past meaning. Sometimes it does, but

152
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:14,480
it can also refer to the present or 
the future.

153
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:24,520
Thanks a lot for watching!
