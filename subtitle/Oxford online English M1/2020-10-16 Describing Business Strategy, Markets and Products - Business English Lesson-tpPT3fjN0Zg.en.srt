00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,160
Hi, I’m Liam. Welcome to Oxford Online English!\h

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,600
In this business English lesson, you’ll\h
learn to talk about marketing strategies\h\h

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,200
and corporate competition. You’ll see lots\h
of useful vocabulary and collocations you\h\h

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,360
can use to talk about business strategy.
You’ll learn useful language to talk\h\h

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,680
about losing market share, entering\h
a new market, launching new products,\h\h

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,312
and staying competitive in an evolving market.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,160
Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us for\h
this conference call, wherever you might happen\h\h

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,720
to be in the world! If you don’t know, my name’s\h
Dimitri, and I lead the marketing department.\h\h

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,160
I’m not sure that you’re aware, but our European\h
business has not been doing well in the last\h\h

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,520
year or so. In particular, we’ve been losing\h
market share to our rivals. A Korean company,\h\h

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,800
Neidon, entered the European market three\h
years ago, and have adopted an aggressive\h\h

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,840
pricing strategy, which is putting pressure on\h
our revenues. Additionally, a German start-up,\h\h

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,480
called Hammer, have expanded their market\h
share in Germany, Austria and Switzerland,\h\h

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,080
partially at our expense. It’s clear that\h
we need to respond to these market forces,\h\h

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,840
and I’d like to start thinking about\h
our options during this meeting.\h

16
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,600
In this presentation, you heard some phrases based\h
on the word ‘market’. Let’s look at a few of them.\h

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,440
Imagine that you want to explain the meaning of\h
these phrases in English. What would you say?\h

18
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,720
If you’re losing market share, then your\h
business has a smaller proportion of\h\h

19
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,840
the available customers. The phrase in\h
sentence two has the opposite meaning;\h\h

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,960
if you expand your market share, you reach\h
a higher proportion of potential customers.

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,800
You can also gain market share,\h
which has the same meaning.\h

22
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:15,120
‘Market forces’ – you can also say ‘market\h
pressures’ – describes the conditions in a market,\h\h

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,480
and how they affect company\h
behaviour and strategy.

24
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,200
For example, a market in a particular field,\h\h

25
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,320
or a particular area, might get more or\h
less competitive with time. Consumers there\h\h

26
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:38,000
might get richer or poorer. These are examples of\h
market forces which businesses need to adapt to.\h

27
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,040
Generally, you can improve your English to\h
talk about these topics by paying attention\h\h

28
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,640
to *collocations*. A collocation is when\h
you use words in a specific combination.

29
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,840
‘Expand your market share’ is a collocation.\h
You might know all these words individually,\h\h

30
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,520
but could you use them together? With\h
collocations, you need to learn the\h\h

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,400
combination of words as a single block, so that\h
you can use them together without thinking.

32
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,080
We recommend going back to the presentation text\h
and trying to find more useful collocations. Do\h\h

33
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,160
the same with the other presentation texts\h
which you’ll see in the rest of this lesson!

34
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,800
You’re about to hear the\h
presentation for part two.\h\h

35
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,160
Don’t forget to listen out for\h
collocations. In the presentation,\h\h

36
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,000
there are three new collocations with the\h
word ‘market’. Try to find them as you listen!\h

37
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,480
I’d like to discuss an idea which\h
has been floating around lately,\h\h

38
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,560
and explain why I don’t think it’s a solution\h
to our problems. I’m talking about China;\h\h

39
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,640
I’ve heard from many of you that we should try to\h
enter the Chinese market, but I don’t think this\h\h

40
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,680
is a good strategic move for us right now. First\h
of all, the regulatory barriers to entry are high.\h\h

41
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,080
Secondly, there’s already fierce competition,\h
from both local and international companies.\h\h

42
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,120
Finally, the cost of getting established\h
in a new market can be large, and while\h\h

43
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,960
we’re financially solid, we don’t have so much\h
free cash flow, so we’d have to take on debt.\h\h

44
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,200
Instead, I think we should focus\h
on our North American presence,\h\h

45
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,640
where we’re already in a strong market\h
position and the competition is less intense.\h

46
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,840
Did you hear the collocations with\h
the word ‘market’? Here they are.\h

47
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:51,120
What does ‘getting established’ mean?
‘Established’ means something like ‘stable’ or\h\h

48
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,280
‘comfortable’. If you get\h
established in a new market,\h\h

49
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,000
you reach a position where your business is\h
comfortable, and you’re not fighting for survival.\h

50
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,840
There were also several other useful phrases\h
in the presentation. Let’s look at a few.\h

51
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,760
Can you remember the missing words? Remember\h
that you can go back and listen to the\h\h

52
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:24,320
presentation again if you want!
Here are the answers.\h

53
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,760
‘Move’ here means something like\h
‘decision’ or ‘plan’. It’s a noun.

54
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,840
If something is a good decision, you can\h
describe it as a ‘good move’ or a ‘smart move’.\h

55
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,200
If you want to enter a new market, there\h
will usually be some barriers to entry.\h\h

56
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,040
These could be regulatory – laws and rules\h
which it is difficult or expensive to follow.\h\h

57
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,560
They could be cultural – maybe there isn’t much\h
demand for your product in some countries or\h\h

58
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:02,720
cultures. They could be financial – maybe you need\h
to invest heavily to start a new operation. If the\h\h

59
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,600
barriers to entry are high, then it’s especially\h
difficult to get established in a new market.\h

60
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,840
There are many words which you can\h
combine with the word ‘competition’.\h\h

61
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,480
In the presentation, you also\h
heard ‘intense competition’.

62
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,760
Here’s a task: go to a good online\h
dictionary – we recommend Longman or\h\h

63
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,840
Lexico – and find three more adjectives which\h
can collocate with the word ‘competition’.\h\h

64
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,240
If your English is intermediate level or\h
higher, focusing on collocations is often a\h\h

65
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:47,840
better way to improve your vocabulary, rather than\h
spending all your time learning individual words.

66
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,720
Again, when you listen to the presentation, try\h
to find new collocations with the word ‘market’.\h\h

67
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,320
There are three to find.\h

68
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Another way that we might compensate\h
for the decline in our European business\h\h

69
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,360
is by bringing new product lines to market, both\h
in Europe and elsewhere. This could help us to\h\h

70
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,400
expand our customer base and claw back some of\h
the market share we’ve lost in recent years.\h\h

71
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,240
Additionally, to cut down on travel expenses,\h
we’ve been retraining our sales teams\h\h

72
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,800
so that they can work remotely. We\h
started work on this very early,\h\h

73
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,160
which we hope will give us a competitive edge over\h
other firms that still rely on face-to-face sales.\h\h

74
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,880
Overall, our strategic vision for the next\h
five to ten years is to take a more global,\h\h

75
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,560
less Europe-centric approach. That doesn’t\h
mean we’ll be neglecting our European business,\h\h

76
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,280
but we’ll be focusing more on emerging markets,\h
and trying to build a dominant position there.\h

77
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,560
Here are the three new collocations with ‘market’.\h

78
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,240
‘Claw back’ is an interesting verb. Do\h
you know what it means, or can you guess?\h

79
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,160
‘Claw back’ means to fight to get\h
back something which you lost.\h

80
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,360
Now, to practise the other language\h
you heard, look at some questions.\h

81
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,080
Pause the video, and try to make answers to these\h
three questions. Make sure your answers are full\h\h

82
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,640
sentences, and make them as detailed as possible.\h
Write them down, or say them out loud, or do both!\h

83
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,520
Ready? Could you do it?\h

84
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,400
Of course, there’s more than one way to\h
answer, but let’s look at some sample answers.

85
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,280
You could say: ‘A company can expand its\h
customer base by launching new products,\h\h

86
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,840
entering new regional markets, or attracting\h
new customers through advertising.’\h

87
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,840
You could say: ‘A company can gain a\h
competitive edge by having a superior product,\h\h

88
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,400
having lower prices, or by offering\h
better customer service and support.’\h

89
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,160
You could say: ‘In my country,\h
there’s a restaurant chain\h\h

90
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,320
called Goody’s that have a dominant\h
position in the fast food market.\h\h

91
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,880
It’s one of the few countries where MacDonald’s\h
haven’t been able to gain much market share.’\h

92
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,360
If you found it difficult to answer the three\h
questions yourself, use our answers as templates.\h\h

93
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,280
Use the sentence structures we used, and\h
change the details to use your own ideas.

94
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,200
Also, just practising your answer once\h\h

95
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,920
might not be enough! Say your answer out loud\h
several times, until you can do it fluently.

96
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Let’s move on to our last section.\h

97
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,520
As before, try to find new collocations\h
with the word ‘market’ in the presentation.\h\h

98
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,200
This time, there are three to find.\h

99
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,400
So far, we’ve focused more on challenges which\h
we’re currently facing, but there’s plenty of good\h\h

100
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:24,880
news, too. In Latin America, we are in a dominant\h
position, with two of our largest competitors\h\h

101
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,600
announcing recently that they’re planning to\h
get out of the market, which is great news for\h\h

102
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,640
us and should allow us to consolidate our position\h
further. However, we don’t want to get complacent.\h\h

103
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,480
We have a first mover advantage in most of\h
Latin America, but other companies will notice\h\h

104
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,760
our success and try to move in. One thing I’d\h
like our product teams to start thinking about\h\h

105
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,720
is how to keep our pricing competitive and\h
make it difficult for any new market entrants.\h\h

106
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,720
We should also be looking at long\h
term trends in South America,\h\h

107
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,240
and make strategic decisions that reflect the\h
changing market conditions across the continent.\h

108
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:16,560
Did you find the new collocations? Here they are.
In part two, you heard a collocation which\h\h

109
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,440
means the opposite of ‘get out of\h
the market’. Do you remember it?\h

110
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,880
The opposite is ‘enter the market’,\h
as in ‘enter the Chinese market’,\h\h

111
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,200
‘enter the Brazilian market’, and so on.

112
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,840
Let’s look at some more useful phrases you\h
heard. Can you remember the missing words here?\h

113
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Can you remember? Pause the video\h
if you need more time to think.\h

114
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
Ready? Here are the answers.\h

115
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,320
If you consolidate something, you\h
make it stronger and more stable.\h

116
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,720
‘First mover advantage’ means the benefits you\h
get from being first to enter a new market,\h\h

117
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,200
or launch a new product. For some\h
time, you have no competition,\h\h

118
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
because you were faster than your rivals.\h

119
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,200
‘Move in’ here has the direct meaning of entering\h
a new market, but it has a secondary meaning, too:\h\h

120
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,920
it has the idea of trying to\h
take market share and customers.\h

121
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,600
That’s all for this lesson, but there’s\h
a lot of information and vocabulary here.\h\h

122
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,280
We recommend that you go through the presentations\h
again and find new words and phrases to learn.

123
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,160
Thanks for watching!

124
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,360
See you next time!
