00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,860
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,030
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,559
In this lesson, you’re going to learn about
setting goals for yourself in your English

4
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,620
studies, and how it can help you to learn
English faster.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,620
Setting goals?

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,470
What’s that got to do with English?

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,930
Actually, it’s incredibly important.

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,980
Mistakes with goal setting are a big reason
why English learners don’t reach their goals.

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:34,320
When we meet new students at OOE, the first
thing we do is talk about goals and help students

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,690
set clear study targets.

11
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,000
We often hear students say things like:

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,680
“I want to be fluent in English.”

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,970
“I want to speak English like a native speaker.”

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,110
“I want to speak without making pronunciation
or grammar mistakes.”

15
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,170
Here’s the thing: these goals are no good.

16
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,640
If you say things like this, you’ll create
problems for yourself.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,710
Let’s think about why that is.

18
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:06,070
Firstly, these goals are too big, and too
unclear.

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,790
What does ‘fluent’ mean?

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,680
How will you know when you’re fluent in
English?

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,360
Ask ten different people what ‘fluent’
means, and you’ll get ten different answers.

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,930
Because you have this goal which is huge and
unclear, you don’t know where to start.

23
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,820
You know you want to do something, but you
don’t know what.

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,509
Even if you do make some progress, you don’t
feel like you’re getting closer to what

25
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:32,509
you want.

26
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,930
Then, you feel discouraged.

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,850
“Why can’t I learn English?”

28
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,250
“Why is my English still so bad?”

29
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:46,369
“Why am I spending all this time studying
if my English isn’t getting better?”

30
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:48,670
At this point, many people give up.

31
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,830
But, it doesn’t have to be like this.

32
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,770
There’s a better way: SMART goal setting.

33
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:03,840
SMART is an acronym; it stands for specific,
measurable, achievable, relevant, timebound.

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,060
To make progress in English, you need to think
about your goals.

35
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,219
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to set
SMART goals, and how this can help you to

36
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,829
learn English faster.

37
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:17,460
First, let’s look at SMART goals in more
detail.

38
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,080
The ‘s’ in SMART stands for ‘specific’.

39
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,629
Your goals need to be specific.

40
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:35,439
“I want to speak English like a native”
is not specific; “I want to be able to talk

41
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,120
about everyday topics without hesitating”,
is better.

42
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,379
“I want to improve my English grammar”—not
specific enough.

43
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:51,800
“I want to learn how to use past verb forms
accurately” is better.

44
00:02:51,800 --> 00:03:00,080
Sometimes, you might need to talk to a teacher
or an expert to help you make your goals specific.

45
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:05,159
Alternatively, you might need to do some research
to set specific goals.

46
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,230
‘M’ stands for ‘measurable’.

47
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,339
There needs to be a way you can check your
progress.

48
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:17,579
So, here’s a better goal: “I want to be
able to talk about five everyday topics for

49
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:20,180
one minute without hesitating.”

50
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,409
‘A’ stands for ‘achievable’.

51
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:28,870
Your goal shouldn’t be too easy, but it
also shouldn’t be too hard.

52
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:35,260
If you say something like, “I want to speak
perfect English,” that isn’t achievable.

53
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:41,860
That doesn’t mean you can never do it, but
it’s a goal which will take years—or decades—to

54
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,340
reach.

55
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,879
You need a goal you can achieve in a relatively
short time period.

56
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:54,129
So, if you have a bigger goal, like “I want
to speak English fluently,” you need to

57
00:03:54,129 --> 00:04:01,059
break that goal into smaller, more achievable
steps, like, “I want to be able to talk

58
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:06,989
about five everyday topics for one minute
without hesitating.”

59
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,779
Next is ‘R’, which stands for ‘relevant’.

60
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:16,729
This means that your English-learning goals
need to connect with other parts of your life.

61
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:23,349
If you want to improve your pronunciation,
think about why you need this.

62
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:25,419
What will it help you to do?

63
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:30,880
What will change in other areas of your life
if your English pronunciation is better?

64
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,660
You need an answer to this, because it’s
almost impossible to stay motivated if your

65
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,990
studies don’t make a difference in other
parts of your life.

66
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,639
Finally, the ‘T’ stands for ‘timebound’.

67
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,530
This means you need a time limit on your goal.

68
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:54,830
You need to set a date where you can say,
“I did this!” or “I didn’t do this…”

69
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:00,970
Hopefully, because your goals are specific,
achievable and relevant, you’ll be able

70
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,259
to say, “I did this!” more often than
not!

71
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:10,319
So, let’s add a time limit to our goal:
Now you know what SMART goals are.

72
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:22,080
Let’s look at how you can set yourself SMART
goals to improve different areas of your English.

73
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,050
Do you want to improve your English speaking?

74
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,169
Of course you do!

75
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,080
Everyone we meet wants to speak English better.

76
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,469
Here’s something we often hear from students:

77
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:35,199
“I want to express myself better.

78
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,960
I feel like I don’t have enough vocabulary
when I speak English.”

79
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,530
Let’s make some SMART goals from this idea.

80
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,710
First of all, what do you want to talk about?

81
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,080
Everyday topics, like your home, your family,
or your hobbies?

82
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,510
Or, do you want to talk about more abstract
or poetic, like history, psychology, or love?

83
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,410
Choose something.

84
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:08,110
Everyone’s different, so we can’t choose
a topic for you, but choose one for yourself.

85
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,400
Next, make your goal measurable.

86
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,240
Adding a time element is a good way to do
this; for example:

87
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:26,030
“I want to be able to talk about Van Gogh’s
life and paintings in detail for three minutes

88
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,380
without running out of words.”

89
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:35,000
Next, you need to ask yourself: is this achievable
and relevant?

90
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:42,210
Is this realistic for you, and does it connect
to other areas of your life?

91
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,979
Looking at our example goal—talking about
Van Gogh’s life and paintings—the answers

92
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:48,500
will probably be ‘no’!

93
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,569
That’s because it’s an example which we
gave you.

94
00:06:52,569 --> 00:07:00,020
But, when you make your own goals, you should
ask yourself the same questions: is it realistic,

95
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,949
and does it connect to other areas of your
life?

96
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:08,340
If you don’t do this, you’ll waste time
working towards goals which are unrealistic

97
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,120
or irrelevant.

98
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,120
This will hurt your motivation.

99
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,480
Finally, you need to make your goal timebound;
for example:

100
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:24,210
“By the end of this month, I want to be
able to talk about Van Gogh’s life and paintings

101
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:30,830
in detail for three minutes without running
out of words.”

102
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:37,650
To reach your goal, you may need to set yourself
additional, minor goals, such as:

103
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:47,160
“By the end of this week, I will learn the
English names of ten of Van Gogh’s paintings.”

104
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:54,490
“By the end of next week, I will be able
to describe ‘Sunflowers’ in detail, without

105
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,009
forgetting any words.”

106
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:05,199
“By tomorrow, I will have read this English
article about Van Gogh’s life, and I‘ll

107
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:11,289
underline twenty words and phrases to learn.”

108
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:17,939
In this way, a big, vague goal becomes specific,
and you have clear steps which you can follow

109
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:20,759
to make progress and improve.

110
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,699
Let’s do another example to see how you
can use SMART goals to improve your English

111
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,740
pronunciation.

112
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,620
Here’s something we often hear from students:

113
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,560
“I want to sound more natural when I speak
English.”

114
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,490
Let’s see how you can take this goal and
make it SMART.

115
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,279
Especially with pronunciation and other linguistic
knowledge, you might need some help to make

116
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,620
your goal specific.

117
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:57,459
Often, when we teach people pronunciation,
they need our help because they don’t really

118
00:08:57,459 --> 00:08:59,389
know where to start.

119
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:04,529
If this is your situation, then you either
need help from a teacher, or you need to do

120
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:07,010
your own research.

121
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,130
You need to do something, because a goal like,
“I want to sound more natural when I speak

122
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,240
English,” isn’t enough.

123
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,840
Let’s see how you could make this more specific:

124
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:25,370
“I want to improve my intonation and stress
in English, so that I sound more natural.”

125
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,010
Maybe, for you, this will be different.

126
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:34,320
Maybe you need to learn more about consonant
sounds, or long versus short vowels, or syllable

127
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,040
stress, or something else.

128
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,380
Whatever your goal, you still need to make
it measurable.

129
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:47,850
This is more difficult with pronunciation
goals, but you still need to try.

130
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,620
You could add something like:

131
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:57,560
“I want to study these five units from this
pronunciation book on intonation and stress,

132
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,380
and practice with the audio until it feels
easy.”

133
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:09,240
Then, you need to ask yourself if your goal
is achievable and relevant, like you do with

134
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,070
every goal.

135
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,920
Finally, set a time limit:

136
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:21,470
“Within two weeks, I want to study these
five units from this pronunciation book on

137
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:27,949
intonation and stress, and practice with the
audio until it feels easy.”

138
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:32,430
Your time limits should always be as short
as possible.

139
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,699
Can you see why?

140
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:39,930
You know what happens if you have a deadline
far in the future?

141
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,360
You won’t do anything until the deadline
is close.

142
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,670
You need to feel that you don’t have enough
time, so that you start working towards your

143
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,290
goal sooner.

144
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,800
Let’s do one more example together, to see
how SMART goals can help you to improve your

145
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,640
English grammar.

146
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,300
Again, let’s start with something we often
hear from students:

147
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:13,389
“I want to be more accurate in English,
and make fewer mistakes when I speak or write.”

148
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:16,100
What should I do first?

149
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,560
We hope you know the answer by now.

150
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,990
Hopefully, you’re thinking, “That goal
needs to be more specific!”

151
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,699
So, you need to know: what mistakes do you
make now?

152
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:34,740
And, what exactly do you want to learn to
improve your grammar?

153
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,730
Again, maybe you need some help at this point;
you might need to find a teacher to show you

154
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,300
where you make mistakes, and what you need
to study.

155
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:50,579
Or, you can do your own research to find exactly
what to focus on.

156
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:55,250
However you do it, you need to set a specific
goal, like this:

157
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:00,529
“I want to understand the difference between
the present perfect and the past simple.”

158
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:06,690
“I want to learn how to write complex sentences,
using relative clauses, conjunctions, and

159
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,690
adverbials.”

160
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,990
“I want to make fewer mistakes with grammar
I’ve known for years, like forgetting to

161
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,660
add ‘s’ to a verb in the 3rd person present
simple.”

162
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,260
Next, you need to make your goals measurable.

163
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:24,620
The best way to do this is in writing.

164
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:31,259
For example, if you write something for your
teacher, and your teacher shows you ten mistakes

165
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:35,740
with the present perfect and past simple,
your goal could be:

166
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:42,019
“I want to write a 300-word essay with fewer
than three mistakes involving the present

167
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,720
perfect and past simple verb tenses.”

168
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,800
What’s next?

169
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,210
You should know the answer to this question,
too!

170
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:58,519
Hopefully, you remember that you need to ask
yourself if your goal is achievable and relevant.

171
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,970
These are questions that only you can answer!

172
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,089
Finally, set a time limit:

173
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:11,449
“By the end of next week, I want to write
a 300-word essay with fewer than three mistakes

174
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:14,900
involving the present perfect and past simple
verb tenses.”

175
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:22,310
Again, you might need to set minor goals to
help you reach your major goal; for example:

176
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:28,660
“Today, I will study this unit on the present
perfect tense, and repeat the exercises until

177
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,880
I can get every answer correct.”

178
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:38,139
“Tomorrow, I’ll review the mistakes I
made in the last three things I wrote, and

179
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:42,529
make the mistakes into Quizlet cards, so that
I can remember them.”

180
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:47,580
This might seem like a lot of effort at the
beginning, but it’s worth it.

181
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,569
Once you get used to setting SMART goals,
it’ll become more instinctive.

182
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:58,339
The clearer your goals, the more chance you’ll
have to reach them and get what you want.

183
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:02,759
If you get better at setting goals, you’ll
feel a sense of progress.

184
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,440
This will give you motivation and confidence,
which will make it easier to continue learning

185
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,759
and improving.

186
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:14,699
Now, we have a question for you: what’s
your first SMART goal?

187
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:18,800
Share it in the comments, and tell us if you
made it or not!
