00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,750
Hello.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,750
I'm Oli.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,620
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:12,870
In this lesson, you can learn about dealing
with shyness or nervousness when you speak

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,870
English.

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,630
Do you sometimes feel shy when you speak English?

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,410
Is it worse when you speak to native speakers?

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:28,380
Do these feelings of shyness or nervousness
stop you from practicing and using your English?

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,380
Yes?

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,380
Yes?

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,930
And yes?

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,920
This video could hopefully help you.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,760
Shyness and nervousness are natural, but they
also make it more difficult to speak.

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,490
If you feel shy, you might not be able to
think of things to say, or you might not be

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,280
able to use grammar and vocabulary correctly.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,879
Some English learners get stuck in a pattern
where they feel shy, and so they avoid using

17
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,640
English or speaking English.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,210
Now I can't promise to solve all of your problems
with shyness and nervousness.

19
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,250
But in this video, I'll share some advice
on how to deal with these feelings, which

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,350
I hope will be helpful.

21
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,820
Point one, remember that speaking is just
speaking.

22
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,680
What do I mean?

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,920
Well, when we first hear foreign languages
or meet foreigners, they often sound very

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,380
strange or interesting or exotic to us.

25
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,939
Oh, he's speaking French.

26
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:34,939
Wow!

27
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:40,220
He must be saying something romantic, or he
must be talking about literature or philosophy.

28
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,700
I wish I could understand him.

29
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,479
Oh, wow!

30
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,840
She's writing in Chinese.

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,020
Those characters, they're so beautiful.

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,939
She must be writing a poem.

33
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,909
I wish I could understand what she's writing.

34
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,200
Yeah, you know what?

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,469
Maybe the French guy is talking about philosophy.

36
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:04,170
Maybe he's just talking about how he got stuck
in a traffic jam.

37
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:11,670
Maybe the Chinese girl is writing a poem about
misty mountains, or maybe it's just a shopping

38
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,150
list.

39
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,430
If you think that foreign languages and foreign
people are something strange or exotic, of

40
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,260
course, you'll feel more nervous when you're
speaking.

41
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,760
I think many English learners have this idea.

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,319
They think, "Oh, I'm not talking to a person.

43
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:32,540
I'm talking to a native speaker."

44
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,870
But actually, speaking English isn't something
special.

45
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,950
It's just speaking, like you do all day, every
day.

46
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:47,160
All over the world, most of what people talk
about is quite simple, and it's quite similar

47
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,500
all over the world.

48
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,770
Native English speakers aren't different animals.

49
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,269
They're just normal people.

50
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:56,500
They talk about their work.

51
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,980
They complain about their bosses.

52
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,510
They talk about movies they've seen.

53
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,180
They decide what they're going to have for
lunch and so on, just like anybody else.

54
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,830
So don't think that native speakers are some
kind of magical animal.

55
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,460
They're not.

56
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,159
If you want to talk to them, talk to them.

57
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,520
If you don't, don't.

58
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,430
It's not such a big deal either way.

59
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,430
What?

60
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,599
Not a big deal?

61
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,599
Really?

62
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,540
Yeah, really.

63
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:32,840
You need to ask yourself, part two, "What's
the worst that could happen?"

64
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,580
So you feel really nervous about speaking
English.

65
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:43,340
One day, you find the courage, you go and
talk to a teacher at your school, maybe a

66
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,390
British person or an American person.

67
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,519
It goes horribly badly.

68
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,420
You feel really uncomfortable.

69
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,659
You can't think of anything to say.

70
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:58,090
So you walk away, and you think thoughts like,
"I've embarrassed myself.

71
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,410
I feel like an idiot.

72
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,299
Why is my English so bad?"

73
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:09,340
Here's a question though.

74
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,840
What have you actually lost?

75
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,099
Nothing.

76
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:16,739
It's not a big deal.

77
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:19,019
It's just a conversation.

78
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,150
The big deal is only in your head.

79
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,870
You think these thoughts.

80
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,870
Nobody else.

81
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:31,020
10 years in the future, are you still going
to be thinking and worrying about that time

82
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,190
when, "Oh, I tried to start a conversation,
and it didn't go very well."?

83
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,940
No, of course not.

84
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,340
Why not?

85
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,870
Because it's not that important.

86
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,889
Maybe it feels like a big deal.

87
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:48,630
It feels important at that moment, but it's
not really important.

88
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,320
You haven't lost anything.

89
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,990
You may feel embarrassed, or you may feel
stupid, but you're doing that to yourself.

90
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,950
There's no reason why.

91
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,259
No one else is telling you you're stupid.

92
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:07,790
You aren't risking anything, just by starting
a conversation.

93
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:13,990
I guarantee the person you talk to is not
thinking these thoughts.

94
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,289
So what can you do about these feelings?

95
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:18,350
How can you control them?

96
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,980
Well, let's look at point three: wear a mask.

97
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,910
These feelings of nervousness or shyness are
all inside.

98
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,009
Here's the best piece of advice I can give
you.

99
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:39,000
Just because you feel nervous, you don't have
to act nervous.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,770
Let me tell you a story.

101
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,410
Before I started teaching, I was terrified
of public speaking.

102
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:52,950
Even speaking in front of very small groups
made me feel very nervous and very, very stressed.

103
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:58,990
The first lesson I ever taught was to a group
of maybe eight Russian teenagers, just a small

104
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,169
class.

105
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:04,790
It was the most scared I've ever been in my
life.

106
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,860
That's not an exaggeration.

107
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,870
I have quite seriously never felt so much
fear.

108
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,240
I was shaking.

109
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,569
I was sweating.

110
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:14,780
I couldn't remember anything about my lesson.

111
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,449
I tried to teach something about modal verbs.

112
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,680
I don't think anybody learned anything.

113
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,800
Afterwards, I thought, "How am I going to
do this?"

114
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,440
My trainer gave me the same advice I'm giving
you.

115
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,289
Act confident, even if you don't feel confident.

116
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:33,810
So I did.

117
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,170
The first few months, I still felt really
nervous, but I tried to hide it.

118
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:43,610
After maybe a year, I didn't feel so nervous.

119
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:50,009
After a few years, I could stand in front
of 100 people and expect their attention,

120
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,490
even if I still felt a little bit nervous
inside.

121
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,009
If it worked for me, it can work for you.

122
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:00,800
Sure, it takes time, and it's not easy, but
it's possible.

123
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,440
So act confident.

124
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,530
Hold your head up.

125
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,699
Chin up.

126
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:08,860
Make eye contact, even if it makes you uncomfortable.

127
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,000
Control the speed and the rhythm of your voice.

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,830
Doing these things is not so difficult, and
it will make you feel good because you're

129
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,340
taking control of your feelings, instead of
letting your feelings control you.

130
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,740
OK, you think, "Easy for you, Oli.

131
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,440
You're talking about speaking your own language.

132
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,010
We're talking about speaking a foreign language."

133
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,270
OK, let's talk about that.

134
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,560
Point four: worrying about your language makes
your language worse.

135
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,190
Here's a question: when you hear a foreigner
speak your language, how do you decide if

136
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,020
this person is speaking well or badly?

137
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,460
In most cases, people notice your fluency
and your pronunciation.

138
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:04,340
In speech, people don't pay much attention
to grammar and vocabulary if your speech is

139
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,360
easy to understand.

140
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,910
What does this mean?

141
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,940
It means that if you are embarrassed of your
grammar or your vocabulary when you're speaking

142
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,750
English, you really shouldn't be.

143
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,430
First of all, worrying doesn't solve anything
anyway.

144
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,020
If your grammar is bad, worrying about your
grammar will not make it better.

145
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,259
The only result is that you will feel bad.

146
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:29,139
That's it.

147
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:35,729
Secondly, other people will really not notice
your grammar or vocabulary very much.

148
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,839
Most people don't care about these things,
most people who aren't English teachers.

149
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:47,140
Even English teachers care about these things
at work, and then they stop caring after work.

150
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,140
Trust me.

151
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:53,450
If I've been teaching all day, and you come
and talk to me, I do not want to think about

152
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,810
your grammar or your vocabulary problems.

153
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,890
That's the last thing I want to do at the
end of the day.

154
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,120
Most teachers I know feel the same way.

155
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,779
Most importantly, worrying about your grammar
and vocabulary will affect your fluency.

156
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,670
You'll speak slowly, and you'll hesitate more
if you're always worrying about which verb

157
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,990
form should I use or what's the right word
here.

158
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:23,290
So if you're just having a chat with someone,
don't think about your English too much.

159
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,290
It doesn't help.

160
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,380
It doesn't make your English better, and it
doesn't make it easier to communicate.

161
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,610
Just talk.

162
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,120
Try to communicate your ideas.

163
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,400
You'll sound more confident because you're
not hesitating and worrying about your language.

164
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,310
If you sound more confident, hopefully you'll
feel more confident too.

165
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,360
OK, let's review and put the things we've
talked about together.

166
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,570
Part five, break the habit sooner, not later.

167
00:09:52,570 --> 00:10:00,220
You can't help feeling shy or nervous, but
you can help how you respond to these feelings.

168
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,320
Very often, our responses to our feelings
are habits.

169
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,730
They're habits which are difficult to break,
but not impossible.

170
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:15,380
Every time you want to talk to someone in
English, but you choose not to, you're feeding

171
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,370
your bad habits.

172
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,200
Every time you think to yourself, "My grammar
sucks.

173
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,440
I don't have anything interesting to say,"
you're feeding these bad habits.

174
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,250
So go and talk to someone, even if it makes
you feel uncomfortable.

175
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,640
The first time, it might not go so well.

176
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,690
That's okay.

177
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,310
The 10th time, it will be easier.

178
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,220
The 100th time, it will be much easier.

179
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,600
You won't even remember how difficult it was
at the beginning.

180
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,060
You don't have anything interesting to say?

181
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,060
Fine.

182
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,600
Say something boring.

183
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,500
No one expects you to be interesting all the
time.

184
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,440
No one's interesting all the time.

185
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,550
Just say something boring.

186
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,940
End the conversation.

187
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,760
Most conversations are simple.

188
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,200
It doesn't matter that much what you say.

189
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,290
Worried about your grammar or your vocabulary?

190
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,250
Remember, no one else really cares that much.

191
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,990
Just focus on trying to communicate.

192
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,990
Talk.

193
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,399
Express your ideas.

194
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,060
When you're having a conversation with someone,
these things are much more important.

195
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,390
Most importantly, stop feeding bad habits.

196
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,270
Go talk to people, even if you're uncomfortable.

197
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:29,430
You'll learn quite quickly that feeling shy
or feeling nervous will only stop you speaking

198
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,810
English if you let it.

199
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,630
OK, that's the end of the lesson.

200
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,490
