00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,130
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,299
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:09,790
In this lesson, you can learn about the IELTS
speaking exam.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,519
The IELTS speaking test has three parts.

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:18,130
In this class, you can learn about part one
of the speaking exam in more detail, and how

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,250
to improve your score.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,600
First, let’s review what happens in part
one of the IELTS speaking test.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,480
After you introduce yourself, the examiner
will ask you some simple questions about one

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,370
or two topics.

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:41,230
Some common topics are: where you live, your
job, your family, your free time, food, sports,

11
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,800
and other simple things like this.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,489
Section one of the IELTS speaking test lasts
four-five minutes.

13
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:55,120
The examiner reads questions from a script,
so it’s not a discussion—it's just question

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,420
and answer.

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,719
In this video, we’ll look at some sample
IELTS speaking test questions and answers,

16
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,850
and see what makes a good answer.

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,300
Part one: The First Questions in IELTS Speaking

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:15,080
At the beginning of the exam, the examiner
will ask you some basic questions:

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,220
What’s your name?

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,640
Where are you from?

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,830
Can I see some identification, please?

22
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:27,290
These are easy questions, and they are the
same in every IELTS exam.

23
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,420
Use the start of the exam to get comfortable.

24
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,060
You might be nervous at the beginning of your
IELTS speaking test.

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,600
This is normal, but you need to try to relax.

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,140
If you’re more relaxed, you’ll speak better.

27
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,600
So what can you do?

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,160
Answer the examiner in full sentences.

29
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,390
Don’t say, “Berlin,” say,

30
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,850
"I’m from Berlin."

31
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,880
Don’t say, “Andrew,” say,

32
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,740
"My name's Andrew Gray."

33
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,420
Speak in a clear, confident voice.

34
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,070
Make eye contact with the examiner.

35
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,619
Making a strong start will help you to feel
more in control.

36
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:13,450
This will help you to feel more confident
speaking English in the exam.

37
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,760
Part two: Speaking Fluently and Clearly

38
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,209
After the opening questions, the examiner
will ask you questions about one of the simple

39
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,060
topics we saw earlier.

40
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,760
Let’s start with a simple question:

41
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,950
"Describe your hometown."

42
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,730
We’re going to look at three different answers.

43
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:40,139
In this section, you can see how you can speak
more fluently and clearly.

44
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:41,849
Ready?

45
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:43,690
Answer number one:

46
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,040
"I come from Moscow.

47
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,340
It’s a big city."

48
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,870
What do you think?

49
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,470
Is this a good answer?

50
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,370
No, it isn’t.

51
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,459
It’s too short, and there aren’t any details.

52
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:02,549
To get a score of 6 or 7 in IELTS, you need
to speak at length.

53
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:08,650
You also need to use a wide range of vocabulary,
grammar and pronunciation features.

54
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,959
If you give a very short answer, you can’t
do any of these things.

55
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,400
Remember: every question is a chance to show
the examiner what you can do in English!

56
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,129
Let’s try again!

57
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:23,510
Answer number two:

58
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,080
"I’m from Moscow.

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,280
As you may know, Moscow is the capital of
Russia.

60
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,370
I’m really proud of my city and I miss it
when I’m not there.

61
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,549
In my neighbourhood, there are many cafes
and parks where I like to hang out with friends

62
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:41,010
in the evening."

63
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,349
What about this one?

64
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:43,730
It’s better, right?

65
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,269
It’s longer and it has lots of details.

66
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:52,230
However, this answer isn’t really answering
the question.

67
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,809
The answer talks about how you feel about
your hometown, and what you like doing there.

68
00:03:57,809 --> 00:04:04,590
The question asks you to describe your hometown,
not say how you feel about it.

69
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,620
This is a common problem.

70
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,569
Many IELTS students know that they need to
give longer answers, but it’s also important

71
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:13,150
to stay on topic.

72
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,269
You do need to develop your ideas.

73
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:21,970
You do need to add details to your answers,
but you also need to answer the question which

74
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,419
the examiner asked.

75
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,950
You can’t just talk about whatever comes
into your head!

76
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,740
OK, let’s look at answer number three:

77
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,310
"I come from Moscow.

78
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,770
It’s a very large city, and also the capital,
so it’s very busy and crowded.

79
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,350
It’s the kind of place where people always
seem to be in a hurry.

80
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:50,060
The centre has a lot of historical buildings
and monuments, while out of the centre there

81
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,819
are mostly just residential areas."

82
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,630
This is the best answer.

83
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,840
It’s clear, detailed, and on-topic.

84
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,340
Remember that you can pause the video and
review the answers if you want.

85
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,270
Part three: Using Vocabulary Effectively in
Your Answers

86
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,729
Let’s look at another question:

87
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,699
"Describe your home."

88
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:18,560
This time, we’ll look at two sample answers.

89
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,990
Think about how the candidates use vocabulary,
and which candidate does a better job.

90
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,210
Answer number one:

91
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,700
"I live in an apartment in a big building.

92
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,270
My apartment has four rooms.

93
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,440
There is a bedroom, a living room, and a kitchen.

94
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,070
The fourth room is a…

95
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,070
Um…

96
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,319
I forgot the word in English."

97
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,379
Answer number two:

98
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:48,569
"I live in a mid-sized apartment in a tower
block.

99
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:54,730
It has four rooms in total, with a tiny bedroom,
an open-plan living room, and a dining area,

100
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,970
and a kitchen.

101
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,270
Then there’s a…

102
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,580
What’s the word?

103
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:07,300
Like an office, where I do some work or studying
sometimes."

104
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,030
Which answer do you think is better?

105
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,720
I hope it was obvious: the second answer is
much better.

106
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,930
What makes this answer better?

107
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,900
The use of vocabulary is much better in the
second answer.

108
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,370
The first candidate lives in a big building.

109
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,789
The second lives in a tower block.

110
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:30,180
This is much more specific.

111
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:37,770
The second candidate also uses a lot of adjectives,
like mid-sized, tiny or open-plan, while the

112
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,039
first candidate doesn’t add any description.

113
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:46,759
Using a variety of vocabulary can make your
answer clearer and more descriptive.

114
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,729
This helps your score.

115
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:55,120
Both candidates forget a word, but the second
candidate deals with it much better.

116
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,139
The first candidate just gives up and says
“I don’t know the word” while the second

117
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:04,939
candidate finds a way to explain the word
and explain the meaning.

118
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:09,699
You don’t need a perfect vocabulary to get
a good score in the IELTS exam.

119
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,980
If you don’t know a word, don’t panic,
and don’t give up.

120
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,509
Try to find other words or phrases which have
a similar meaning.

121
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:24,350
When preparing for your IELTS exam, think
about the topics which can appear in part

122
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,580
one.

123
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:32,030
Learn some more advanced or interesting vocabulary
you could use for each topic.

124
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:38,389
For example, learn and practice ten words
to describe your home, ten words to describe

125
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:43,490
your hometown, ten words to talk about your
hobbies, and so on.

126
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,810
Part four: Improving Your Grammar Score in
Part One of the IELTS Speaking Exam

127
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,960
Let’s look at our third sample question:

128
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,430
"What do you like doing in your free time?"

129
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,090
We’ll look at three sample answers.

130
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,410
This time, we’re going to focus on grammar.

131
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,259
Think about how these candidates use grammar.

132
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:06,479
Answer number one:

133
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,330
"I have a lot of different hobbies.

134
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,650
What I do depends on my mood.

135
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:17,240
For example, if I’m feeling energetic, I
like to play basketball or go jogging.

136
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,700
If I want to relax, I read a book or cook
something.

137
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,699
I find cooking very relaxing."

138
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:25,699
What do you think?

139
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:26,840
Good answer?

140
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,729
Yes, it is.

141
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:29,729
It's very good.

142
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:34,169
It’s clear, and the candidate has mixed
shorter and longer sentences.

143
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,400
There aren’t any grammar mistakes.

144
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,310
It’s a really good answer.

145
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:44,410
However, most IELTS candidates can’t use
grammar perfectly, and make mistakes when

146
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,860
they speak.

147
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,460
Let’s look at two more answers which might
be more realistic for you if you’re planning

148
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,840
to take IELTS in the near future.

149
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,290
So, answer number two:

150
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,930
"I have lot of hobbies.

151
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,639
I’m doing different things depending on
what’s my mood.

152
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:08,070
For example, if I am very energy, I will play
basketball or go to jogging.

153
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,950
If I want to relaxation, I read some books
or cook something.

154
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,680
Cooking is relaxing to me."

155
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,060
Answer number three:

156
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,200
"I have many hobbies.

157
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,810
Sometimes I play basketball or go jogging.

158
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,670
Sometimes I read or cook.

159
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,740
Cooking is relaxing."

160
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,680
Remember, we’re focusing on grammar.

161
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,519
Which answer do you think is better?

162
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:43,399
It might surprise you that answer number two
is better than number three, even though there

163
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,630
are many, many grammar mistakes in the second
answer.

164
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,660
In the third answer, there are no grammar
mistakes.

165
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,550
What’s going on?

166
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:00,250
How can an answer with lots of mistakes be
better than an answer with no mistakes?

167
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:07,520
First of all, the second candidate at least
tries to use more complex sentences.

168
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,560
The third candidate uses very short, simple
sentences.

169
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:20,399
This is an interesting point: in IELTS, trying
and failing, or partly succeeding, is better

170
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,459
than not trying at all.

171
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:30,420
The third candidate is trying to stay safe,
by only using grammar which he/she knows,

172
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,430
but this is not the best idea.

173
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,779
Secondly, the second answer is clear.

174
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:45,449
There are lots of grammar mistakes, but the
mistakes don’t make it difficult to understand.

175
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:52,350
This is another important point: in the IELTS
exam, mistakes which don’t affect your meaning

176
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,540
are not such a big problem.

177
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,839
I should say now, this is only true if you
are aiming for a score of 6.0 to 7.0.

178
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,070
If you need to get 7.5 or higher, then you
need to speak accurately, without grammar

179
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,770
mistakes, like the first candidate.

180
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:15,190
However, this is not true for many IELTS students,
especially students I meet.

181
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,630
Most people need a score in the 6.0-7.0 range.

182
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,440
If this is what you need, you don’t need
perfect grammar, just like you don’t need

183
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,470
perfect vocabulary.

184
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,150
You need to use what you know to communicate
clearly.

185
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,930
That’s much more important.

186
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:40,089
So, if you know that your grammar is not perfect,
it’s better to try to speak fluently and

187
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:42,630
express yourself clearly.

188
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,380
You can still get a good score in the IELTS
speaking test.

189
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,720
Part five: Review

190
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,880
Let’s go over what we’ve talked about
today.

191
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,389
To get a higher score in part one of the IELTS
speaking test, you need to:

192
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:03,959
Give longer, more detailed answers without
going off-topic.

193
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:09,829
You need to use a range of vocabulary to make
your answers more descriptive.

194
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:15,570
You need to find a way to express yourself
even if you don’t know a word.

195
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:23,529
You need to try to use some longer, more grammatically
complex sentences even if you make some mistakes.

196
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:26,230
Think about the questions we looked at today:

197
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,090
"Describe your hometown."

198
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,000
"Describe your home."

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,399
"What do you do in your free time?"

200
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,199
Think about how you could answer these questions
in the IELTS exam.

201
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:42,470
What details could you add?

202
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,230
What vocabulary could you use?

203
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:50,610
If you want, you can leave your answers in
the video comments, and we’ll give you feedback.

204
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,850
That’s the end of the lesson.

205
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,940
Thanks very much for watching!

206
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,370
I really hope it was useful for you..

209
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,300
Thanks again.

210
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,899
See you next time!
