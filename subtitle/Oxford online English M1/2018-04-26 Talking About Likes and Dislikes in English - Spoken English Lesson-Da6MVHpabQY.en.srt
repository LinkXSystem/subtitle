00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,860
Hi, I’m Stephanie.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,190
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:12,590
In this lesson, you can learn how to talk
about things you like or dislike in English.

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,620
What do you like doing most of all?

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,640
What’s your favourite thing to do?

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,200
What things do you have to do regularly, but
you aren’t so keen on?

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,310
What about the things you can’t stand doing?

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,990
Can you think of something you really hate?

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,300
During this lesson, you’ll learn how to
talk about things that you like and dislike using

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,149
clear, natural English.

11
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:43,960
Let’s go back to a question you heard before:
what’s your favourite thing to do?

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,740
So, what kind of music are you into?

13
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:52,479
I’m a big fan of blues, classic soul, things
like that.

14
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,549
I really love Billie Holliday and a lot of
stuff from that era.

15
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:57,320
What about you?

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,139
I listen to a lot of different stuff, but
what I really like is hip-hop.

17
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:05,640
Do you listen to music a lot at home?

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,250
Oh sure, all the time.

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,260
My favourite thing to do at the end of a long
day is put on a record and just chill out

20
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,990
on the sofa with some good tunes.

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,280
Record?

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,490
You mean vinyl?

23
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,610
Of course!

24
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,180
There’s no other way to listen.

25
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,810
I wouldn’t go that far!

26
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,830
Music makes me happy wherever I am.

27
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:34,520
I can listen on my phone, at home, on vinyl,
on CD…

28
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
I don’t care.

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,230
I just like it!

30
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:42,670
Here, you heard several useful phrases to
talk about things you really like.

31
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,750
Can you remember any of them?

32
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,330
If you really like something, you can say:

33
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,760
I really love…

34
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,290
I’m a big fan of…

35
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,380
What I really like is…

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:03,909
My favourite thing to do is…
… makes me happy

37
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:07,770
In the gap, you can put a noun, or an -ing
verb.

38
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,009
For example:

39
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,420
I really love seafood.

40
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,180
Or: I really love swimming in the sea.

41
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,450
This is true for all these phrases.

42
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,450
Look at two more:

43
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,129
I’m a big fan of 80s glam rock.

44
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:27,959
I’m a big fan of listening to music when
I go jogging.

45
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,959
You can also vary some of these phrases, to
make them stronger or weaker, or just to add

46
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,090
variety.

47
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,349
For example:

48
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:43,849
What I really enjoy is getting up late on
a Sunday and going for coffee with friends.

49
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:48,799
My absolute favourite food is spicy chicken
wings.

50
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:52,379
Doing yoga in the morning makes me feel good.

51
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,920
Okay, what about you?

52
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,790
Can you make some sentences using these phrases?

53
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,889
You can talk about music, or any other topic
you like.

54
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:09,040
Pause the video and write down two or three
sentences, using the language from this section.

55
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,860
Ready?

56
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,240
Let’s move on to part two.

57
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,819
Where shall we go?

58
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:18,969
How about pizza?

59
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,780
Errgh…

60
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,459
I’m not keen on the pizza places around
here.

61
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:28,599
There’s a Chinese place nearby which is
supposed to be alright.

62
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,719
Want to check it out?

63
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:33,450
Honestly, I don’t like Chinese food so much.

64
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,689
I quite like Japanese food, though.

65
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:39,040
Are there any Japanese places around here?

66
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,159
No, don’t think so.

67
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,319
That doesn’t help then.

68
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,650
Indian?

69
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,859
Spicy food isn’t my thing.

70
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,280
KFC?

71
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,220
Yeah…

72
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,980
KFC’s alright.

73
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,499
Let’s go to KFC.

74
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:58,439
So, we live in a town with all these great
restaurants, and we’re going to KFC?

75
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,439
Seriously?

76
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,510
What’s wrong with KFC?

77
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,439
It’s not bad.

78
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,529
Fine, let’s go.

79
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:12,170
In this dialogue, you heard phrases to talk
about low-level likes and dislikes.

80
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:18,440
If you like something, but not that much,
how can you say that?

81
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,440
Here are the three ways you heard:

82
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,820
I quite like…

83
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,310
It’s alright.

84
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,890
It’s not bad.

85
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:31,350
The word alright doesn’t mean that something
is good by itself.

86
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:37,350
However, with a positive intonation, it can
mean that you like something.

87
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:43,620
Again, you can use these phrases with a noun
or an -ing verb, like this:

88
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,230
I quite like going for a short walk after
lunch.

89
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,620
The film was alright.

90
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,060
This garlic sauce is not bad!

91
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,660
What if you don’t like something?

92
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,950
What could you say?

93
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,760
Here are the phrases you heard in the dialogue:

94
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,980
I’m not keen on…

95
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:12,300
I don’t like … so much
… isn’t my thing

96
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,400
Let’s see how you could use them:

97
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,130
I’m not keen on horror films.

98
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,700
I don’t like going to the gym so much.

99
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,210
Getting up early isn’t my thing.

100
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:33,470
Again, you can use many of these phrases in
different ways, by changing or adding words.

101
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,840
For example:

102
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,820
I quite enjoy cycling.

103
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,180
I’m not massively keen on that plan.

104
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:47,750
Spending hours sitting on the beach isn’t
exactly my thing.

105
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,170
What about you?

106
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,370
In our dialogue, we talked about food.

107
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,010
Can you use the language you’ve seen to
make two or three sentences about yourself?

108
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,740
You can write about food, or any other topic.

109
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,320
For extra practice, say your sentences out
loud.

110
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,430
Say them several times, until the pronunciation
is comfortable.

111
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:14,720
Try to remember them, so that you can say
them without reading.

112
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,110
This way, you’ll remember the language better.

113
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:24,060
Pause the video and write your sentences now;
start again when you’re ready.

114
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:31,590
Okay, you’ve seen how to talk about things
you like a lot, or things you like a little.

115
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:38,200
But what if you really don’t have an opinion
about something?

116
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,620
What a great movie!

117
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,620
What did you think?

118
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,270
It was okay.

119
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,270
You didn’t like it?

120
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,070
I didn’t mind it.

121
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,940
I’ve seen better; I’ve seen worse.

122
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,300
You’re difficult to please, aren’t you?

123
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,040
I thought it was amazing!

124
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,170
Don’t you think he’s a great director?

125
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,490
I really like everything he’s made.

126
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,460
I don’t have strong opinions about him.

127
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,580
So, what do you like?

128
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,030
Honestly, I haven’t seen many movies that
have impressed me recently.

129
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,530
I saw that new ‘Blade Runner’ film.

130
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,890
And, you didn’t like it?

131
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,890
Meh…

132
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,750
I could take it or leave it.

133
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,770
You’re annoying.

134
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,950
Anyway, what shall we do now?

135
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,210
Get a drink, or something to eat?

136
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,940
I’m not bothered either way, to be honest.

137
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:32,540
In that dialogue, I did not have a lot of
strong feelings about, well, anything really.

138
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,450
Can you remember the words and phrases I used
to express this?

139
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:42,350
Often, you can express this kind of idea just
with a word or a gesture.

140
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:47,560
Imagine you’re watching something on TV,
and someone asks you if it’s a good show

141
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,830
or not.

142
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:54,910
You can express that it’s neither good nor
bad by making a ‘meh’ noise and shrugging.

143
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:59,460
However, there are also some useful phrases
you can use, such as:

144
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,810
It’s okay.

145
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,560
I don’t mind…

146
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,060
I don’t have strong opinions about…

147
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,220
I can take it or leave it.

148
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,920
I’m not bothered either way about…

149
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:22,190
Like the phrases you’ve seen in other sections,
you can use these with a noun or an -ing verb,

150
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:28,810
except for I can take it or leave it, which
is a fixed phrase, meaning that you can use it

151
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:34,150
as a response to someone else’s question
or suggestion.

152
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:39,990
Let’s see how you could use these phrases
to talk about different things:

153
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,130
The modern art museum was okay.

154
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,770
I don’t mind doing housework.

155
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,570
I don’t have strong opinions about which
curtains we buy.

156
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,810
I’m not bothered either way about where
we go.

157
00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:00,810
When you use okay, like the word alright,
a lot depends on your intonation.

158
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,690
The word okay literally means ‘not good
and not bad’.

159
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:11,960
However, with positive intonation, it can
have a positive meaning, like quite good.

160
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,390
With negative intonation, it can mean something
like not very good.

161
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:21,050
Listen to the difference:
It’s okay!

162
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,900
It’s okay.

163
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,750
It’s okay.

164
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,010
In this way, okay can mean different things.

165
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:36,690
Also, the phrase I’m not bothered either
way is more informal, and could sound rude

166
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:43,310
or dismissive if you use it in the wrong situation,
so think about where you are and who you’re

167
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,500
talking to before you say it.

168
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,240
So, it’s your turn to practice again!

169
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:57,630
Can you think of a movie or TV show that was
just okay—not that good, and not that bad?

170
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:03,230
Your job is to write three sentences
about yourself using the language from this

171
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,440
section.

172
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,930
If you can’t think of a movie or TV show
to talk about, you can choose a different

173
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,000
topic.

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,280
Pause the video and write your sentences now.

175
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,560
Okay?

176
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:22,740
Finally, let’s see how you can talk about
things you hate.

177
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,220
That’s IT!

178
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,900
I’m finished with that place.

179
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,410
I’m definitely quitting this time!

180
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,220
I can’t work there another day.

181
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,490
What happened now?

182
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,540
He is the worst manager ever!

183
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,020
I can’t stand working with him.

184
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,200
I used to like going to work, but now I absolutely
hate it!

185
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,180
I have to find another job.

186
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,850
You know you’ve been saying that for…

187
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,850
Ooh…

188
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,120
Since I met you?

189
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,800
Yeah, but this time I mean it.

190
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,310
Even the little things are starting to drive
me crazy, like the way he fidgets with his

191
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,120
coffee cup when he talks.

192
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,910
So, have you started looking for a new job?

193
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,190
Not yet, but I will.

194
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,580
I need a change.

195
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,430
What about your colleagues?

196
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,490
I thought you got on well with them.

197
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,630
Some of them are alright, but I have no time
for that woman in the accounts department.

198
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,460
I really dislike the HR guy, too, whatever
his name is.

199
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,000
You know, maybe you should be less negative.

200
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,740
If you go to work with that kind of attitude,
I’m not surprised you clash with people.

201
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
What do you mean, negative?

202
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,500
I can’t stand people telling me what to
do!

203
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,860
What are you even talking about?

204
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,120
I have no time for people like you and your
stupid advice…

205
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,910
Okay, here you heard a lot of phrases to talk
about something—or someone—you strongly

206
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,050
dislike.

207
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,410
Can you remember any of them?

208
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,230
If you really dislike something, you can say:

209
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,820
I can’t stand…

210
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:55,820
I absolutely hate…
… drives me crazy.

211
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,070
I have no time for…

212
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,760
I really dislike…

213
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,000
As before, you use these phrases with a noun
or an -ing verb.

214
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,370
For example:

215
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,170
I can’t stand people who cut in line.

216
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:18,210
I absolutely hate every song he’s ever made.

217
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:24,360
Walking behind someone who walks really slowly
drives me crazy!

218
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,589
Some of these phrases are more general.

219
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:34,589
You can use I can’t stand…, I absolutely
hate…, or I really dislike… to talk about

220
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:38,850
anything: people, things, or activities.

221
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,760
However, with the other two phrases,
you would use them to talk about people and

222
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
their habits.

223
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,220
For example:

224
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,010
She’s always late, which drives me crazy.

225
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:57,540
I have no time for people who say nice things
to your face, then gossip behind your back.

226
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,399
Okay, what about you?

227
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:04,650
It’s your last practice: pause the video,
and write three sentences about things you

228
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,399
strongly dislike.

229
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,860
Use the language from this section, and start
again when you’re ready.

230
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,860
How was that?

231
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,090
Could you use the language easily?

232
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,270
Did you check to make sure you didn’t make
any mistakes?

233
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:25,090
Finally, we have a question for you: what
do you like or dislike most about studying

234
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,529
English?

00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:28,850
